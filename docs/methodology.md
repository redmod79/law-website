# Law of God Series — Investigative Methodology

*This file defines the methodology for ALL studies in the law-XX series (The Law of God). Every analysis agent MUST follow this methodology.*

## Central Question

**What does the Bible say about God's law? Is it abolished, or are God's people still required to keep it? If so, which laws? Is the Sabbath still binding?**

Two positions are investigated:
- **Continues position**: God's moral laws — encoded in the Ten Commandments and expounded upon by Jesus in the NT — are still binding on all believers, including the seventh-day Sabbath. What was abolished was the ceremonial/sacrificial system that pointed to Christ, not the moral law that reflects God's character.
- **Abolished position**: God's law (including the Ten Commandments and Sabbath) was done away with at the cross. Christians are under a "new law" or "law of Christ" that replaces the old. The Sabbath is ceremonial and no longer binding.

**COMMON GROUND (not part of the debate):** Both positions agree that ceremonial laws (sacrifices, feasts, purity regulations, sanctuary service, circumcision) and civil/judicial laws in their specific theocratic form (restitution multipliers, cities of refuge, theocratic court procedures, national penalties) are no longer binding. The cessation of ceremonial and civil laws is NOT the "Abolished" position — it is shared ground. The ONLY question is whether the MORAL law (the Ten Commandments, including the Sabbath) was also abolished or whether it continues. Items about ceremonial or civil cessation should be classified **Neutral**, not Abolished.

**KEY POSITIONAL DISTINCTION:** The Continues position argues that the Bible itself distinguishes between different categories of law (moral, ceremonial, civil) — evidenced by different origins (God's voice vs. Moses as mediator), different media (stone vs. scroll), different repositories (inside the Ark vs. beside it), different vocabulary, and different treatment in the NT. The Abolished position argues there is NO such distinction — all law is one unified body, so if any part is abolished, all is abolished. **Therefore, any biblical evidence of a distinction between moral and ceremonial/civil law is an argument FOR the Continues position**, since it undermines the premise that all law is a single indivisible unit. Conversely, any evidence that the law is treated as a single undifferentiated unit supports the Abolished position.

## Investigative Methodology (include verbatim in every agent prompt)

```
INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by those who say the law continues, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by those who say the law is abolished, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says. Do not use editorial characterizations like "genuine tension," "strongest argument," "most significant challenge," "honestly acknowledge," or "non-intuitive reading." Simply state what each passage says and what each side infers from it.
- When presenting findings, state: "The text says X" (explicit). Then state: "From this, Y interpretation infers Z" and "W interpretation infers V" (inferred).
- Never use language like "irrefutable," "obviously," or "clearly proves." Use "the text states," "this is consistent with."
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.
```

## Evidence Classification (REQUIRED in every CONCLUSION.md)

Every CONCLUSION.md MUST include a multi-tier evidence classification section. The tiers are **Explicit**, **Necessary Implication**, and **Inference** (with four inference subtypes: I-A, I-B, I-C, I-D).

**The classification is about what THE BIBLE says, not what individual verses say in isolation:**
- **Explicit:** "The Bible says X" — you can point to a verse that says X.
- **Necessary Implication:** "The Bible implies X" — you can point to verses that, when combined, force X with no alternative.
- **Inferred:** "Someone claims the Bible teaches X" — but no verse says X and no combination of verses forces X. Something must be added that the text does not contain. Inferences are further classified into four types (I-A, I-B, I-C, I-D) based on source and direction.

**Evidence Hierarchy:** E > N > I-A > I-B (resolved by SIS) > I-C > I-D

**CRITICAL RULE: Inferences cannot block explicit statements or necessary implications.** If explicit texts and necessary implications establish X, the existence of passages that *could be inferred* to teach not-X does not prevent X from being a necessary implication. The passages cited against X must be evaluated on their own terms — if reading them as contradicting X requires adding a concept, choosing between readings, applying an external framework, or systematizing, then that reading is itself an inference and cannot override what the explicit texts state.

### 1. Explicit Statements Table

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | [What the text directly says — a quote or close paraphrase] | [Book Chapter:Verse] |

Rules for explicit statements:
- The text must directly say this. Quote or closely paraphrase the actual words of Scripture.
- One explicit statement per verse or closely related verse cluster.
- Include statements from ALL sides of the debate.
- A paraphrase of a single verse in different words is still explicit. "Thou shalt not kill" = "God forbids murder" -> explicit (same verse, same meaning).
- **THE MEANING OF WORDS IS EXPLICIT.** If a single verse uses a word, what that word means is part of the explicit statement. "Not come to destroy but to fulfil" directly means Jesus did not come to abolish the law. "Nailed to the cross" means that thing was removed. These are not separate conclusions — they are what the verse says.

**CRITICAL: What the text SAYS vs. what a position INFERS:**
- **E tier** = what the text directly states (what both sides must acknowledge as textual fact)
- **I tier** = what a position interprets/infers from that text

Examples (using passages in this series):
- "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets" (Mat 5:17) -> **E** (what the text says)
- "Therefore Jesus affirmed the entire Mosaic system including ceremonies" -> **I-A** (systematizes, but derived from E)
- "The word 'fulfil' (pleroo) is used in Mat 5:17 and the word 'abolish' (kataluo) is the negative" -> **E** (grammatical fact)
- "Therefore 'fulfil' means to complete and terminate" -> **I-B** (requires interpreting what pleroo means in context)
- "Text says the handwriting of ordinances was nailed to the cross (Col 2:14)" -> **E** (what the text states)
- "Therefore the Ten Commandments were nailed to the cross" -> **I-B** (requires identifying what cheirographon refers to — moral or ceremonial?)

**The test:** Could both Continues and Abolished readers accept this as a factual observation about what the text says, even while disagreeing about what it means or implies? If yes -> E or N. If no (one side must deny it) -> only then classify by position.

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | [What unavoidably follows from explicit statements] | [Which E# statement(s)] | [Why no reader could deny this conclusion from those statements] |

Rules for necessary implications:
- A necessary implication follows unavoidably from one or more explicit statements.
- **No additional concept, framework, or interpretation is required** — only understanding what the words mean.
- **Every reader, regardless of theological position, must agree this follows.** If a reasonable reader could disagree, it is an inference, not a necessary implication.
- Include necessary implications from ALL sides of the debate.

**What belongs here:**
- **The logical entailment of explicit words.** If the text says God spoke the Ten Commandments directly (E) and gave the ceremonial laws through Moses as mediator (E), then "the Bible presents two different modes of delivery for these two categories of law" is a necessary implication — it is what those two facts together entail.
- **Combinations of explicit statements that yield an unavoidable conclusion.** If E says "the law is holy, just, and good" and E says "God's character is holy, just, and good," then "the law reflects God's character" follows necessarily.
- **Observable patterns stated as conclusions.** If the Decalogue is placed INSIDE the Ark (per E) and the book of the law is placed BESIDE the Ark (per E), then "the Bible places these in two different repositories" is a necessary implication.
- **Direct entailments.** If two explicit facts together produce a conclusion without any additional reasoning, that conclusion is a necessary implication.

**Test:** Could a plain reader reach this conclusion from the cited explicit statements without importing any theological framework? Would EVERY reader, from ANY theological tradition, agree this follows? If yes -> necessary implication. If no -> inference.

**STRICTER N-TIER TEST:**

Ask these three questions for EACH N item:

1. **Universal agreement test:** Would a scholar from the OPPOSITE theological position (Abolished if you're Continues, Continues if you're Abolished) necessarily agree this follows from the cited E statements?
   - If NO -> it's an inference, not a necessary implication

2. **No interpretation required test:** Does this require choosing between possible meanings, or is it the only possible meaning?
   - If it requires choosing -> it's an inference (I-B)

3. **Zero added concepts test:** Does this add ANY concept, framework, or connection not present in the explicit statements themselves?
   - If YES -> it's an inference (requires criterion #1, #3, or #4b)

**Common N-tier misclassifications to avoid:**

- "Since the same Greek word (nomos) is used in both passages, both refer to the same law" -> **WRONG** (requires interpreting what nomos means in each context — that's criterion #2, making it I-B)
- "The same Greek word (nomos) appears in both passages" -> **CORRECT** (observable grammatical fact, both sides agree)

- "Since the law was written on stone, it is permanent and eternal" -> **WRONG** (requires inferring permanence from medium — that's I-B)
- "The Decalogue was written on stone by God's finger; the ceremonial laws were written by Moses in a book" -> **CORRECT** (two separate observable statements)

- "Since Paul says faith establishes the law, the moral law continues" -> **WRONG** (requires choosing which law Paul means — that's I-B)
- "Paul says 'Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law'" -> **CORRECT** (observable textual fact)

**If an N item requires defending it or explaining why someone should accept it, it's probably an inference.**

### 3. Inferences Table (4-Type Taxonomy)

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | [The claim about what the Bible teaches] | [I-A/I-B/I-C/I-D] | [What the relevant verses actually say — cite E# and N# items AND include actual verse references and what they say] | [What must be added beyond what the text contains] | [Which criterion/criteria apply] |

#### The 4-Type Inference Taxonomy

Two dimensions create a 2x2 matrix:

|  | Aligns with E/N | Conflicts with E/N |
|--|--|--|
| **Derived from E/N** | **I-A** (Evidence-Extending) | **I-B** (Competing-Evidence) |
| **Not derived from E/N** | **I-C** (Compatible External) | **I-D** (Counter-Evidence External) |

**I-A (Evidence-Extending):** Uses ONLY vocabulary and concepts found in E/N statements. Only an inference because it systematizes multiple E/N items into a broader claim. Strongest inference type.

**I-B (Competing-Evidence):** Some E/N statements support it, but other E/N statements appear to contradict it. Genuine textual tension where both sides can cite Scripture. Resolved by the Scripture-Interprets-Scripture (SIS) protocol.

**I-C (Compatible External):** Reasoning from outside the text (theological tradition, philosophical framework, historical context) that does not contradict any E/N statements. Supplemental only — adds information the text does not contain but does not override anything the text says.

**I-D (Counter-Evidence External):** External concepts that require overriding, redefining, or qualifying E/N statements to be maintained. Weakest inference type — requires the text to mean something other than what it says.

#### Mechanical Tests for Classification

**Source test** (derived vs. external): Strip away the systematization. Are ALL remaining components found in the E/N tables? YES = text-derived (I-A or I-B). NO = external (I-C or I-D).

**Direction test** (aligns vs. conflicts): Does the claim require ANY E/N statement to mean something other than its lexical value? YES = conflicts (I-B or I-D). NO = aligns/compatible (I-A or I-C).

**Consistency checks:**
- I-A should only require criterion #5 (systematizing) and optionally #4a (SIS). If it requires #1, #2, or #3, it is misclassified.
- Every I-B must have E/N items on BOTH sides. If only one side has E/N support, it is I-A or I-D.
- Every I-D must override at least one E/N statement. If it overrides nothing, it is I-C.

#### Rules for inferences:
- An inference is a claim about what the Bible teaches that **no verse explicitly states** and **no combination of verses necessarily implies.** Something must be added beyond what the text contains.
- State each inference as a Bible-wide claim ("The Bible teaches X"), not as a verse-specific interpretation ("Verse Y means Z"). Then show why no verse says it and no combination forces it.
- **Always include the actual verse references and what they say** in the "What the Bible actually says" column — not just E#/N# numbers. The reader should see the biblical evidence without cross-referencing.
- Include inferences from ALL sides (both Continues and Abolished positions)
- Identify what reasoning step is required that the text itself does not state
- Note when an inference requires applying concepts not found in the text

**An inference MUST require at least one of these:**
1. **Adding a concept the text doesn't state** — e.g., "all laws were equally nailed to the cross" when the text just says "handwriting of ordinances"
2. **Choosing between two possible readings** — e.g., interpreting "law" (nomos) as the whole Torah vs. the ceremonial system
3. **Applying an external framework** — e.g., the threefold division of the law (moral/ceremonial/civil) as a theological category
4. **Cross-referencing (split into 4a and 4b — see SIS section below)**
5. **Systematizing into a doctrine** — e.g., combining multiple texts into a comprehensive theological position

**If you cannot identify which of these an inference requires, it is probably a necessary implication and should be moved.**

## Scripture-Interprets-Scripture (SIS) Principle

### What SIS Means for the Law Series

Criterion #4 splits into two:
- **#4a** (SIS with verified textual connection) — NOT an inference trigger. When a clear passage interprets an unclear one, and the connection is verified (shared vocabulary, OT quotation, tool-verified parallel score, or the text itself establishes the connection), this is standard hermeneutics, not an inference. Document the connection.
- **#4b** (cross-referencing without verified textual connection) — IS an inference trigger. The reader must supply the connection between passages. The link depends on the interpreter's judgment, not on the text itself.

### How to Document SIS Connections

When using #4a (SIS with verified connection), document:
1. The clear passage and the unclear passage
2. The nature of the connection (shared vocabulary, OT quotation, parallel score, self-reference)
3. Why the clear passage is clearer (using the clarity criteria below)
4. How the clear passage determines the reading of the unclear one

### I-B Resolution Protocol

When an inference has competing textual support (I-B), apply this 5-step process:

**Step 1: Identify tension.** List E/N items FOR and AGAINST the claim.

**Step 2: Assess clarity** of each E/N item on a 3-level scale:
- **Plain**: Directly addresses the topic using relevant vocabulary; no interpretation needed
- **Contextually Clear**: Addresses the topic but requires genre/audience/context awareness
- **Ambiguous**: Could plausibly be read either way

**Step 3: Count and weigh.** Plain statements outweigh Ambiguous ones (not a mere vote count). The weight is determined by clarity level, not just quantity.

**Step 4: Apply SIS.** Plain statements determine the reading of Ambiguous ones. The clear interprets the unclear.

**Step 5: State resolution.** One of:
- **Strong** — Plain statements on one side with only Ambiguous statements on the other
- **Moderate** — Mix of Plain and Contextually Clear on the dominant side
- **Unresolved** — Substantial Plain/Contextually Clear statements on both sides

**Clarity criteria** (what makes a passage "clearer"):
1. **Directness of vocabulary** — actual words vs. figurative language
2. **Genre** — didactic > apocalyptic > parabolic
3. **Scope** — universal statement > specific situation
4. **Frequency** — repeated across authors/testaments > single occurrence
5. **Self-interpretation** — text explains its own meaning = maximally clear

### I-B Resolution Subsection

After the Inferences table, include a dedicated **I-B Resolution** subsection for EACH I-B inference with the full 5-step analysis:

```
#### I-B Resolution: [Inference #] — [Short description]

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR: [E#, N# items supporting the claim]
- AGAINST: [E#, N# items opposing the claim]

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**
| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E# | Plain/Contextually Clear/Ambiguous | [Why] |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
[Summary of how items on each side weigh]

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
[How plain statements determine reading of ambiguous ones]

**Step 5 — Resolution: [Strong/Moderate/Unresolved]**
[Explanation]
```

## Classification Decision Trees

Apply these trees mechanically when classifying every evidence item. Every gate is a binary YES/NO answerable from the text itself. Work through each tree in order. Do not skip gates.

---

### Tree 1 — Tier Classification

**Start:** You have an observation or claim about what the Bible says.

```
Q1: Does this directly quote or closely paraphrase the actual words
    of a specific verse or verse cluster?
    NO  -> go to N-CHECK
    YES -> go to E-CHECK

E-CHECK:
  E1: Is this the plain lexical meaning of those words —
      no concept, framework, or interpretation added beyond what
      the words themselves require?
      YES -> TIER: E (Explicit). Stop. Go to Tree 3 (E-Positional).
      NO  -> go to N-CHECK

N-CHECK:
  N1: Does this follow unavoidably from one or more E-items?
      NO  -> TIER: I (Inference). Stop. Go to Tree 2 (I-Type).
      YES -> go to N2

  N2: Would a scholar from the OPPOSITE theological position
      necessarily agree this follows from the cited E-items,
      without any additional reasoning?
      NO  -> TIER: I. Stop. Go to Tree 2.
      YES -> go to N3

  N3: Does reaching this conclusion require choosing between
      two possible meanings of a word or phrase?
      YES -> TIER: I. Stop. Go to Tree 2.
      NO  -> go to N4

  N4: Does this add ANY concept, framework, or connection not
      already present in the cited E-items themselves?
      YES -> TIER: I. Stop. Go to Tree 2.
      NO  -> TIER: N (Necessary Implication). Stop. Go to Tree 4 (N-Positional).
```

---

### Tree 2 — I-Type Classification

**Start:** You have an item classified as I (Inference). Which subtype?

```
SOURCE TEST:
  S1: Strip away any systematization. Are ALL remaining components
      of this claim found verbatim or directly in the E/N tables?
      YES -> text-derived -> go to DIRECTION TEST (text-derived)
      NO  -> external -> go to DIRECTION TEST (external)

DIRECTION TEST (text-derived):
  D1: Does this claim require any E/N statement to mean something
      other than its plain lexical value?
      NO  -> TYPE: I-A (Evidence-Extending). Stop. Go to Tree 5 (I-Positional).
      YES -> TYPE: I-B (Competing-Evidence). Stop. Go to Tree 5.
            [I-B requires a full SIS Resolution subsection in the analysis.]

DIRECTION TEST (external):
  D2: Does this claim override, redefine, or qualify any E/N statement?
      NO  -> TYPE: I-C (Compatible External). Stop. Go to Tree 5.
      YES -> TYPE: I-D (Counter-Evidence External). Stop. Go to Tree 5.

CONSISTENCY CHECKS (run after typing — reclassify if any check fails):
  I-A check: Does it require ONLY criterion #5 (systematizing)?
             If it also requires #1, #2, or #3 -> reclassify.
  I-B check: Does it have E/N items on BOTH sides?
             If only one side has E/N support -> reclassify as I-A or I-D.
  I-D check: Does it override at least one E/N statement?
             If it overrides nothing -> reclassify as I-C.
```

---

### Tree 3 — E-Item Positional Classification

**Start:** You have a verified E-item. Does it support Continues, Abolished, or Neutral?

```
STEP 1 — VOCABULARY SCAN:

  V1: Does the verse use law-continuation vocabulary
      applied to God's commandments or moral law,
      OR does it distinguish between categories of law
      (moral vs. ceremonial/civil)?
      Keywords: keep my commandments, law is holy/just/good/spiritual,
      establish the law, write on hearts, not come to destroy,
      law of liberty, royal law, sin is transgression of the law,
      commandments of God (in Revelation), sabbath (creation/Decalogue context),
      forever/eternal/perpetual (applied to commandments),
      delight in the law, blessed who keep commandments
      Distinction indicators: different origin (God spoke vs. Moses wrote),
      different medium (stone tablets vs. book/scroll), different repository
      (inside the Ark vs. beside the Ark), different vocabulary for different
      law types, different NT treatment of moral vs. ceremonial commands,
      explicit separation of categories (e.g., Deut 4:13-14, Lev 23:37-38)
      YES -> Candidate: CONTINUES -> go to Step 2

  V2: Does the verse use law-cessation vocabulary
      applied to the law or specific laws?
      Keywords: nailed to cross, blotted out, abolished, done away,
      taken out of the way, shadow, figure, carnal ordinances,
      imposed until time of reformation, changed priesthood = changed law,
      old covenant vanishing away, weak and beggarly elements,
      yoke of bondage, not under law, end/telos of the law,
      wall of partition broken down
      YES -> Candidate: ABOLISHED -> go to Step 2

  Both V1 and V2 YES -> note both; Step 2 determines which survives.
  Both V1 and V2 NO  -> NEUTRAL. Stop.


STEP 2 — FOUR VALIDATION GATES:
(Must pass ALL four. Failure at any gate -> go to Step 3.)

  GATE 1 — SUBJECT/OBJECT GATE:
    Is the grammatical subject or object identifiable as a specific
    category of law (moral, ceremonial, civil) by the verse's own context?
    Automatic FAIL if:
      * The verse uses "law" (nomos/torah) without any contextual indicator
        of WHICH laws are meant, and the reading requires assuming one category
      * The verse's referent is genuinely ambiguous between moral and ceremonial law
    PASS -> continue to Gate 2
    FAIL -> record "Referent of 'law' is ambiguous in this verse." -> go to Step 3.

  GATE 2 — GRAMMAR GATE:
    Does the original-language grammar unambiguously support
    the proposed positional reading with no alternative parsing?
    Automatic FAIL if any of the following apply:
      * Reading depends on punctuation absent from the original
      * A key word (nomos, entole, dogma) has a semantic range that
        allows a different referent than the proposed reading assumes
      * A modifier or qualifying phrase attaches grammatically to a
        different noun than the reading requires
      * The verse is part of a larger argument and the reading
        ignores the flow of that argument
    PASS -> continue to Gate 3
    FAIL -> record which specific grammar issue. -> go to Step 3.

  GATE 3 — GENRE GATE:
    Is the passage didactic prose?
    Didactic = direct teaching, epistle, law, narrative report,
               direct-speech prophecy ("Thus says the Lord...")
    Automatic FAIL if passage is:
      * An apocalyptic vision (symbolic imagery in Revelation, Daniel)
      * A typological narrative used figuratively
    Note: Most law passages are in didactic/legal genre and will pass this gate.
    PASS -> continue to Gate 4
    FAIL -> record "Genre is [apocalyptic/typological]." -> go to Step 3.

  GATE 4 — HARMONY GATE:
    Is the proposed positional classification consistent with
    all other E-items in the master evidence file?
    Check:
      * Same-author E-items on the same topic
      * Cross-testament E-items sharing key vocabulary or subject
      * E-items already classified in the opposite direction on this topic
    If a conflict is found, apply SIS resolution:
      * Use clarity criteria (didactic > apocalyptic > parabolic;
        universal > specific; repeated > single occurrence)
      * Does the clearer passage govern the reading of the less clear?
        YES -> apply that reading, re-run Gate 4 with corrected reading
        NO  -> unresolvable conflict -> FAIL -> record conflicting E-item -> go to Step 3.
    No conflict found -> PASS -> CLASSIFICATION STANDS. Stop.


STEP 3 — RECLASSIFICATION CHECK:
(Reached when any gate fails. Failure means the proposed classification
does not hold. It does NOT automatically mean Neutral.)

  RC1: State what the gate failure revealed:
       Gate 1: Referent of "law" is ambiguous — could be [X] or [Y]
       Gate 2: Grammar allows alternative parsing: [describe it]
       Gate 3: Passage is [apocalyptic/typological]
       Gate 4: Conflicting E-item [ID] says [what it says]

  RC2: Form the CORRECTED textual observation by applying
       the gate's correction:
       Gate 1: Restate observation noting the ambiguous referent
       Gate 2: Restate using the grammatically valid alternative parsing
       Gate 3: Restate as genre-appropriate reading
       Gate 4: Restate incorporating the SIS resolution from conflicting E-item

  RC3: Re-enter STEP 1 with the corrected observation.
       Does the corrected observation pass V1 (continuation vocabulary)?
         YES -> CONTINUES. Stop.
       Does the corrected observation pass V2 (cessation vocabulary)?
         YES -> ABOLISHED. Stop.
       Neither applies -> NEUTRAL. Stop.

  NOTE: The corrected observation is still an E-item — the text says
  what it says. Only the positional direction changes. The item remains
  in the Explicit table; only its position column is updated.
```

**Generic example of reclassification flow:**

| Scenario | Gate that fails | RC2: Corrected observation | RC3: Result |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Verse says "law" is abolished; but context identifies the referent as ceremonial ordinances | Gate 1: "law" referent identified by context as ceremonial | Restate: "Ceremonial ordinances are abolished." Re-enter V1/V2: V2 applies to ceremonial law, which is consistent with the Continues position (moral law continues, ceremonial ceases). | Neutral (both sides agree ceremonial law ceased) or Continues (if the verse itself distinguishes ceremonial from moral) |
| Verse says "not under the law"; grammar shows "under the law" means under condemnation/penalty, not under obligation to obey | Gate 2: "under the law" has alternative meaning | Restate with grammatically valid reading: "Not under the condemnation of the law." Re-enter V1/V2: neither continuation nor cessation vocabulary applies to condemnation status. | Neutral |
| Verse appears to say law continues; same author elsewhere says a specific category of law was taken away | Gate 4: harmony conflict with same-author statement | Apply SIS: the other passage specifies WHICH law was removed. Restate incorporating that distinction. | Depends on corrected observation |

---

### Tree 4 — N-Item Positional Classification

**Start:** You have a verified N-item. Same as Tree 3 with one additional gate first.

```
GATE 0 — FOUNDATION GATE (N-items only):
  Verify the item genuinely belongs at N-tier before classifying position.
  Apply all three N-tier tests:
    N-Test 1 (Universal agreement): Would a scholar from the opposite
      position necessarily agree this follows from the cited E-items?
    N-Test 2 (No interpretation required): Is this the only possible
      conclusion — not a choice between two readings?
    N-Test 3 (Zero added concepts): Does this add nothing beyond
      what the source E-items themselves contain?
  All three YES -> PASS -> continue to Tree 3 (Vocabulary Scan onward).
  Any NO -> item is misclassified as N -> send back to Tree 1 (N-CHECK fails) ->
            reclassify as I -> apply Tree 2 -> apply Tree 5.
```

---

### Tree 5 — I-Item Positional Classification

**Start:** You have a typed I-item (I-A, I-B, I-C, or I-D). What position does it support?

```
NOTE: The four-gate validation (Trees 3/4) does NOT apply to I-items.
The inference category already acknowledges that interpretation is required.
Position simply reflects which direction the inference points.

  IP0 (MANDATORY FIRST CHECK): Does this inference concern ONLY the
       cessation of ceremonial laws (sacrifices, feasts, purity,
       circumcision) or civil/judicial laws in their specific
       theocratic form (restitution formulas, court procedures,
       cities of refuge, penalties)?
       YES -> NEUTRAL. Both sides agree these ceased. Stop.
       NO  -> continue to IP1.

  IP1: Does this inference support the claim that God's MORAL law
       (Decalogue, including Sabbath) remains binding on believers,
       is eternal, reflects God's character, is written on hearts,
       is established by faith, defines sin, is kept by God's
       end-time people? OR does it support the existence of a
       biblical distinction between moral and ceremonial/civil law
       categories (different origins, media, repositories, vocabulary,
       NT treatment)?
       YES -> CONTINUES

  IP2: Does this inference support the claim that the MORAL law
       (Decalogue, including the Sabbath) was abolished, nailed to
       the cross, replaced by a new law, was temporary, was a
       shadow fulfilled in Christ, is a yoke removed? OR does it
       support the claim that all law is a single indivisible unit
       with no moral/ceremonial/civil distinction?
       YES -> ABOLISHED
       NOTE: If the inference is only about ceremonial or civil
       cessation, it should have been caught by IP0 -> Neutral.

  IP3: Does the inference support both, or neither?
       BOTH -> verify it is classified I-B (competing evidence from both sides).
               If not I-B, reclassify. Apply SIS resolution to determine
               which direction the weight of evidence favors.
       NEITHER -> NEUTRAL.
               (The inference concerns genre, methodology, vocabulary,
                historical background, ceremonial/civil cessation,
                or is shared framework for both sides.)

### 4. Verification Phase (REQUIRED)

After completing all tables, run this verification check:

**Step A: Verify explicit statements:**
- Does each E-statement directly quote or closely paraphrase actual verse text?
- Is it actually just the plain meaning of the words in the verse?
- **Is this what the text SAYS (E) or what a position INFERS from it (I)?** If it's an inference, move it.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items (REQUIRED):**

For each E-item classified as Continues or Abolished (not Neutral), apply **Tree 3 (E-Item Positional Classification)** from the Classification Decision Trees section above. This is mandatory — do not assign a positional direction to an E-item without running the full tree.

The tree runs three core checks before a positional classification stands:

1. **Referent check** — Does the verse identify WHICH law is being discussed?
   - "Law" (nomos/torah) has a wide semantic range — it can mean the Decalogue, the Pentateuch, the ceremonial system, or the entire OT
   - Verify the verse's own context identifies the referent before classifying positionally

2. **Grammar check** — Does the original-language grammar actually require this positional reading?
   - Greek has no punctuation — comma placement is editorial, not a textual fact
   - Key terms (nomos, entole, dogma, cheirographon) must be evaluated for their semantic range in context
   - Verify which noun a modifier grammatically attaches to

3. **Harmony check** — Does this classification conflict with any other E-item?
   - One explicit statement cannot contradict another
   - Check same-author statements and cross-testament statements on the same topic

**If any check fails, apply the Reclassification Check (Tree 3, Step 3).** A failed gate does NOT automatically mean Neutral — the corrected observation may point to the opposite position. Re-enter the vocabulary scan with the corrected observation to determine the actual classification.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications:**
- Does each N follow unavoidably from the cited E statements?
- Could ANY reader deny this conclusion while accepting the explicit statements? If yes -> move to Inferences.
- Is it actually just a direct quote or close paraphrase of a single verse? If yes -> move to Explicit.
- Apply the three N-tier tests (universal agreement, no interpretation required, zero added concepts). If any test fails -> move to Inferences.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test):**
For each inference, strip away the systematization. Are ALL remaining components found in the E/N tables?
- YES -> text-derived (I-A or I-B)
- NO -> external (I-C or I-D)

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test):**
Does the claim require ANY E/N statement to mean something other than its lexical value?
- YES -> conflicts (I-B or I-D)
- NO -> aligns/compatible (I-A or I-C)

**Step E: Run consistency checks:**
- Every I-A: Does it only require criterion #5 (and optionally #4a)? If it requires #1, #2, or #3, reclassify.
- Every I-B: Does it have E/N items on BOTH sides? If only one side has E/N support, reclassify as I-A or I-D.
- Every I-D: Does it override at least one E/N statement? If it overrides nothing, reclassify as I-C.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections:**
- Is each #4a connection documented with shared vocabulary, OT quotation, or tool-verified parallel?
- Is each #4b properly treated as an inference trigger?

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Do NOT classify the plain meaning of words as inference. "Holy" means holy. "Perpetual" means perpetual. "Abolished" means abolished.
- Do NOT classify observable textual patterns as inference. If Scripture places the Decalogue inside the Ark and the book of the law beside it, that's a fact you can observe.
- Do NOT classify unavoidable combinations as inference. If explicit statements A + B together yield C with no alternative, C is a necessary implication.
- The COUNTER-CLAIM to an explicit statement or necessary implication is often the real inference. If the text says "the law is holy, just, and good," the necessary implication is that the law has positive moral attributes. The inference is "Paul is speaking hypothetically and doesn't really mean the law still applies" (applies a qualifier the text doesn't state).
- **Do NOT classify what a text SAYS as supporting a position.** Only classify by position when one side must DENY the textual observation. Otherwise classify as Neutral.

**After verification:**
- Move misclassified items between tables as needed
- Update the tally counts
- Ensure every inference has a clear Type (I-A, I-B, I-C, or I-D)
- Ensure every inference identifies which criterion/criteria apply
- Ensure every I-B has a full Resolution subsection
- Ensure every necessary implication cites its source E# statements and explains why it is unavoidable

### 5. Master Evidence Database (REQUIRED before writing Tally)

**Before computing your tally, you MUST check and update the evidence database.**

The evidence database (`D:/bible/bible-studies/law-evidence.db`, managed by `D:/bible/evidence_db.py`)
replaces the old `law-master-evidence.md` markdown file. It holds all E/N/I items registered by
every prior study and assigns IDs atomically — no duplicates, no guessing.

Steps:
1. **Check for existing items** before adding anything new (keyword or semantic search):
   ```bash
   python D:/bible/evidence_db.py find E --ref "Rom 7:12" --text "law is holy"
   python D:/bible/evidence_db.py search "the law is holy just and good" --tier E
   ```
2. **For each E/N/I item in your tables:**
   - If a match exists → note the master ID in your CONCLUSION.md (e.g., "E23 → Master E042") and record your study: `python D:/bible/evidence_db.py also-in E042 law-XX`
   - If no match → reserve the next ID: `python D:/bible/evidence_db.py next-id E` then add it
3. **In your CONCLUSION.md, add a note:** "Evidence items registered in D:/bible/bible-studies/law-evidence.db"

**Full workflow with command examples:** see the **Standard Evidence DB Workflow** section in the plan file (`law-series-plan-sqlite.md`).

**Why this matters:** law-31 queries the evidence database directly to produce the final deduplicated positional tally. This is the deduplication mechanism — it happens incrementally as each study completes, not retroactively at synthesis time.

### 6. Tally Summary

```
- Explicit statements: [count]
- Necessary implications: [count]
- Inferences: [count]
  - I-A (Evidence-Extending): [count]
  - I-B (Competing-Evidence): [count] ([N] resolved, [M] unresolved)
  - I-C (Compatible External): [count]
  - I-D (Counter-Evidence External): [count]
```

### 7. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

**What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):**
- [List — draw from both Explicit and Necessary Implication tables]

**What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):**
- [List of things neither side can claim the text directly says or necessarily implies — including things commonly assumed by BOTH sides]

## Critical Rules Governing the Hierarchy

1. **E > N > I-A > I-B > I-C > I-D.** Higher-tier evidence governs the interpretation of lower-tier claims. An I-D claim cannot override an E statement.

2. **Inferences cannot block explicit statements or necessary implications.** If explicit texts and necessary implications establish X, the existence of passages that *could be inferred* to teach not-X does not prevent X from being established.

3. **I-A inferences are the strongest inferences** because they use only the text's own vocabulary and concepts. They are inferences only because they systematize.

4. **I-B inferences require the SIS protocol.** Both sides have textual support. The resolution must be documented. Plain passages interpret ambiguous ones.

5. **I-D inferences bear the heaviest burden.** They require overriding what the text says with concepts the text does not contain. They are valid only if the text itself provides reason to read against its surface meaning.

6. **SIS connections (#4a) are not inference triggers.** Using clear passages to interpret unclear ones — when the connection is verified — is standard hermeneutics. Only unverified cross-references (#4b) trigger inference classification.

## Positional Tally (REQUIRED in law-31 Synthesis ONLY)

**The evidence database (`law-evidence.db`) is the deduplication mechanism.** Each study (law-01 through law-30) checks the database before adding items. By the time law-31 runs, the database already contains a deduplicated set. Law-31's job is to:

1. **Query the evidence database** — it is already deduplicated:
   ```bash
   python D:/bible/evidence_db.py tally
   python D:/bible/evidence_db.py list --tier E --classification Continues
   python D:/bible/evidence_db.py list --tier E --classification Abolished
   python D:/bible/evidence_db.py list --tier N
   python D:/bible/evidence_db.py list --tier I
   ```
2. **Verify integrity** — flag any items that appear to be duplicates that slipped through (same verse + same observation registered under different IDs)
3. **Produce the positional tally** from the database contents

**Classification rules for positional tally:**

**CRITICAL: The debate is ONLY about the moral law (Decalogue/Sabbath).** Both positions agree that ceremonial laws (sacrifices, feasts, purity regulations, circumcision) and civil/judicial laws (theocratic penalties, restitution formulas, court procedures) ceased in their specific Mosaic form. The cessation of ceremonial and civil laws is NOT the "Abolished" position — it is common ground. The only question is whether the MORAL law (Ten Commandments, including the Sabbath) was also abolished or whether it continues.

**Classify by position ONLY when the item bears on the moral law (Decalogue/Sabbath):**

- **Continues:** Item states or implies the moral law/Decalogue/specific moral commandments remain in force, are eternal, are written on hearts, define sin, are holy/just/good/spiritual, are established by faith, are kept by God's end-time people, are expounded/magnified by Jesus, or that the Sabbath is a creation ordinance still observed. **Also Continues: any evidence that the Bible itself distinguishes between categories of law** (moral vs. ceremonial/civil) — different origins, different media, different repositories, different vocabulary, different NT treatment, explicit separation of categories — because the Continues position depends on this distinction existing while the Abolished position denies it.

- **Abolished:** Item states or implies the MORAL law (Decalogue, including the Sabbath) was done away, abolished, nailed to cross, replaced by a new law, temporary, or no longer binding. This classification applies ONLY when the item argues that the Ten Commandments themselves (not just ceremonial or civil laws) were abolished. **Also Abolished: any evidence that the Bible treats all law as a single indivisible unit** with no distinction between moral and ceremonial/civil categories — because the Abolished position depends on all law being one unified body.

- **Neutral/Shared:** Factual observations BOTH sides must accept, OR items about the cessation of ceremonial/civil laws (which both sides agree on):
  - Grammatical facts (same word used, word counts, parsing data, semantic ranges)
  - Statistical observations (vocabulary distributions, occurrence counts)
  - Genre identifications (apocalyptic, didactic, legal)
  - Subject identifications (which law is being discussed)
  - Textual observations about what is or isn't stated
  - Hebrew/Greek vocabulary facts (torah means X, nomos can mean Y or Z)
  - **Ceremonial law cessation** (sacrifices fulfilled, feasts as shadows, circumcision no longer required) — both sides agree
  - **Civil law cessation in specific theocratic form** (restitution formulas, cities of refuge, theocratic court procedures) — both sides agree
  - Any observation both Continues and Abolished scholars can accept as textual fact

**The key question:** Does this item bear on whether the MORAL law (Decalogue/Sabbath) continues or was abolished? If it's about ceremonial or civil cessation, both sides agree -> Neutral. If it's about the moral law, classify by position.

**Examples of Neutral E items (NOT positional):**
- "Paul uses the word nomos 119 times in his epistles"
- "The word torah in Gen 26:5 appears alongside mitsvah, choq, and mishpat"
- "Hebrews 7:12 states 'the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law'"
- "Jesus entered the synagogue on the sabbath day 'as his custom was' (Luke 4:16)"
- "The Greek word dogma appears in Col 2:14 and Eph 2:15"

**Examples of positional E items:**
- Continues: "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (Rom 7:12), "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law" (Rom 3:31)
- Abolished: "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances" (Eph 2:15), "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow" (Col 2:16-17)

## Conclusion Tone Rule

The conclusion section of every study MUST:
- Present the classification results as data
- State what the evidence tiers contain
- NOT use hedging language like "this doesn't prove X" or "this doesn't disprove Y"
- NOT editorialize about what the results mean for either position
- Let the numbers and classifications speak for themselves

Example of what TO write: "Across 29 studies, [N] explicit statements and [M] necessary implications use law-continuation vocabulary. [P] Abolished claims are classified as I-D (counter-evidence external). [Q] Continues claims are classified as I-A (evidence-extending)."

Example of what NOT to write: "This does not prove the law is abolished" or "This does not disprove the Continues position."

## No Editorial Opinion

- Do NOT characterize passages as being "in tension" with each other — simply state what each passage says
- Do NOT call any argument "the strongest" or "the weakest" — present the arguments and the evidence
- Do NOT use "genuinely ambiguous" — state the possible readings and note which the text specifies or does not specify
- Do NOT say something "requires sustained effort to maintain" — state the reasoning required and let the reader assess
- For passages covered by later studies in the series, briefly state what the text says and cross-reference the later study

## Cross-References to Other Studies

When a passage is examined in depth in another law-XX study:
- Briefly state what the verse says (quote it)
- Add: *(Examined in depth in law-XX-slug.)*
- Do NOT editorialize about the passage — that's for the dedicated study

## Prior Study Conclusions

Each study should consult prior work before beginning analysis. Prior findings inform *what areas to investigate* but not *what to conclude*. Each study investigates independently.

**Primary method — study database (scales to 31 studies):**
```bash
python D:/bible/study_db.py find-passage "Rom 3:31"   # find prior analysis of specific passages
python D:/bible/study_db.py find-word "katargeo"       # find prior word studies
python D:/bible/study_db.py search "sabbath creation ordinance" --top 5
python D:/bible/study_db.py get law-08                 # get a specific study's summary
```

**Secondary method — read CONCLUSION.md directly** for the studies the DB search identifies as most relevant. All prior CONCLUSION.md files are at `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-XX-*/CONCLUSION.md`.

For the full query workflow, see the **Standard Study DB Workflow** section in `law-series-plan-sqlite.md`.
