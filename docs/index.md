# The Law of God: What Does the Bible Say?

*A comprehensive 33-study biblical investigation examining every major text, word, and argument bearing on the moral law, ceremonial law, the Sabbath, and what continues under the New Covenant.*

---

## The Question

Christians hold differing views on the role of the Old Testament law today. Some argue the moral law (including the Ten Commandments and the Sabbath) continues in full force under the New Covenant. Others argue the entire Mosaic law was abolished at the cross. Rather than assuming either position, this series investigates the biblical evidence from the ground up across 33 studies.

## The Approach

Each study is a genuine investigation. The agents gathered ALL relevant evidence, presented what each side claims, and let the biblical text speak for itself. No study presupposed its conclusion. Evidence was classified into hierarchical tiers:

- **Explicit (E):** What the text directly says -- a quote or close paraphrase
- **Necessary Implication (N):** What unavoidably follows from explicit statements
- **Inference** (four types):
    - **I-A (Evidence-Extending):** Systematizes E/N items using only the text's own vocabulary
    - **I-B (Competing-Evidence):** Both sides cite E/N support; resolved by Scripture-interprets-Scripture
    - **I-C (Compatible External):** External reasoning that does not contradict E/N
    - **I-D (Counter-Evidence External):** External concepts that require overriding E/N statements

**Hierarchy:** E > N > I-A > I-B (resolved by SIS) > I-C > I-D

## Evidence Summary (from Study 31)

Study 31 synthesized the evidence from Studies 1-30 on the central question of what continues and what was abolished. The synthesis classified **810 unique evidence items** across those studies. Studies 32-33 are supplemental investigations addressing the Sabbath specifically (lunar sabbaths and calendar continuity) and are not part of the moral-law-continues-vs-abolished analysis.

### Positional Distribution

| Tier | Continues | Abolished | Neutral/Shared | Total |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| E (Explicit) | 146 | 0 | 367 | 513 |
| N (Necessary Implication) | 73 | 0 | 72 | 145 |
| I-A (Evidence-Extending) | 63 | 0 | 3 | 66 |
| I-B (Competing-Evidence) | 18 | 22 | 7 | 47 |
| I-C (Compatible External) | 1 | 1 | 3 | 5 |
| I-D (Counter-Evidence External) | 0 | 34 | 0 | 34 |
| **Total** | **301** | **57** | **452** | **810** |

Not a single explicit statement (E-tier) or necessary implication (N-tier) in the entire 810-item evidence base was classified as supporting abolition of the moral law. All 219 E+N positional items support "Continues." The Abolished position's 57 items exist entirely at the inference level (I-B and I-D).
