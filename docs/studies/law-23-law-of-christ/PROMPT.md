# law-23: The "Law of Christ" and Related NT Law Phrases

## Question
What is the "law of Christ" (Gal 6:2), the "law of the Spirit of life" (Rom 8:2), and the "law of liberty" (Jas 1:25)? Are these new laws replacing the Ten Commandments, or are they the moral law under a new covenant administration? Investigate every NT phrase that names a "law of ___": law of Christ (Gal 6:2, 1 Cor 9:21), law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus (Rom 8:2), law of liberty (Jas 1:25, 2:12), law of faith (Rom 3:27), law of sin and death (Rom 7:23-25, Rom 8:2), law of my mind (Rom 7:23), law of righteousness (Rom 9:31). Determine whether these are distinct codes/bodies of law, descriptions of how the same moral law functions under different conditions, or uses of "law" (nomos) as "principle/rule." Address the objection that the NT introduces a replacement law that supersedes the Ten Commandments.

## Series Context
This is study 23 in a 31-study series on the Law of God. The series investigates whether God's moral law (Ten Commandments, including Sabbath) continues or was abolished at the cross. Both positions agree ceremonial/civil laws ceased -- the debate is ONLY about the moral law.

## Prior Study Analysis

### CRITICAL: Relationship to Prior Studies

Several prior studies have touched on individual "law of ___" phrases, but no study has comprehensively investigated ALL the NT "law of ___" genitive phrases together. The unique contribution of law-23 is to catalog every such phrase, determine the sense of nomos in each, and assess whether any of these constitute a "new law" replacing the Decalogue.

### law-16 Conclusions (Paul and Law in Romans)

Law-16 (D:/bible/bible-studies/law-16-paul-and-law-in-romans/CONCLUSION.md) established:

- N080: Paul uses nomos in at least four distinct senses: (1) Torah/code, (2) Decalogue specifically, (3) operating principle/pattern, (4) Pentateuch as Scripture-witness
- E393 (Rom 3:27): Paul uses "law of works" (nomos ergon) vs. "law of faith" (nomos pisteos). Nomos here means "operating principle," not Torah. Classified Neutral.
- E401 (Rom 8:2): "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death." Two principles: Spirit's life-giving principle frees from sin's death-dealing principle. Nomos = operating principle in both cases. Classified Neutral.
- E399 (Rom 7:22): "I delight in the law of God after the inward man." Present tense = ongoing delight. Classified Continues.
- E400 (Rom 7:25): "With the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin." Two allegiances in present tense. Classified Continues.
- The law is holy, just, good, and spiritual (E010, E011); faith establishes the law (E025); the dikaioma of the law is fulfilled in Spirit-walkers (E026/E403); love fulfills specific Decalogue commands (E028/E407/E408).
- I105 (I-B): The claim that Paul abolishes the moral law in Romans was resolved Strong against abolition -- the FOR side had only 3 Ambiguous items while the AGAINST side had 11 Plain + 1 Contextually Clear.

### law-17 Conclusions (Paul and Law in Galatians)

Law-17 (D:/bible/bible-studies/law-17-paul-and-law-in-galatians/CONCLUSION.md) established:

- E427 (Gal 6:2): "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ." The "law of Christ" (ton nomon tou Christou) involves moral obligation fulfilled through love. Classified Continues.
- E423 (Gal 5:14): "All the law is fulfilled in one word...Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." The entire law is fulfilled (plerotai, Perfect Passive) in the love command. Classified Continues.
- E426 (Gal 5:22-23): "The fruit of the Spirit is love...against such there is no law." The Spirit produces moral character consistent with the law. Classified Continues.
- N086: The specific controversy in Galatians is circumcision/ceremonial, not the moral law.
- N087: Paul affirms the moral law's content even while denying its justificatory power.
- N088: Paul distinguishes circumcision (dismissed) from "commandments of God" (affirmed) in 1 Cor 7:19.
- I110 (I-B): The claim that Galatians abolishes the moral law was resolved Strong against abolition.

### law-22 Conclusions (James and the Law)

Law-22 (D:/bible/bible-studies/law-22-james-and-law/CONCLUSION.md) established:

- E1 (Jas 1:25): "The perfect law of liberty" -- the law is complete and brings freedom. Classified Continues.
- E6 (Jas 2:12): "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty." The law of liberty is a future judgment standard. Classified Continues.
- N1: James identifies the content of "the royal law" and "law of liberty" as including Lev 19:18 and the 6th and 7th Decalogue commandments (Exo 20:13-14). Classified Continues.
- N7: James never cites ceremonial or civil laws as part of the "royal law" or "law of liberty."
- I3 (I-D): The claim that James' "law of liberty" is a new "law of Christ" replacing the OT law was classified I-D (counter-evidence external) because it requires overriding James' explicit phrase "according to the scripture" (kata ten graphen) which locates the law in the OT.
- James uses five law designations found nowhere else in the NT: "perfect law" (nomon teleion), "law of liberty" (nomou eleutherias), "royal law" (nomon basilikon), "one lawgiver" (heis nomothetes), "doer of the law" (poietes nomou).

### law-21 Conclusions (NT Vocabulary Categories)

Law-21 (D:/bible/bible-studies/law-21-nt-vocab-law-categories/CONCLUSION.md) established:

- N1: Entole (G1785) without a qualifier is never used for a ceremonial regulation that was abolished. Every ceremonial/cessation use carries a qualifier.
- N2: Dogma (G1378) is never used for God's moral commandments (the Decalogue).
- N3: The NT vocabulary in affirmation passages is different from vocabulary in abolition passages. Four of five core law terms partition cleanly.
- I1 (I-A): The NT vocabulary encodes a systematic distinction between moral and ceremonial law.

### law-14 Conclusions (Jesus' Law Teachings)

Law-14 (D:/bible/bible-studies/law-14-jesus-law-teachings/) established:

- Word study on [G1772](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1772/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} ennomos ("within law, lawful"): 2 NT occurrences -- Acts 19:39 ("lawful assembly") and 1 Cor 9:21 ("under the law [ennomos] to Christ"). Paul describes himself as ennomos Christou -- "in-law to Christ." This places Paul within a law framework, not outside it.

### law-10 Conclusions (New Covenant and Law)

Law-10 (D:/bible/bible-studies/law-10-new-covenant-and-law/CONCLUSION.md) established:

- The new covenant changes WHERE the law is located (stone to hearts) and HOW obedience is achieved (human effort to Spirit-empowerment), but not WHAT law is in force.
- Rom 8:1-4 analyzed: "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" frees from "the law of sin and death" -- the Spirit enables what the law required but the flesh could not accomplish.

### law-20 Conclusions (NT Greek Law Vocabulary)

Law-20 (D:/bible/bible-studies/law-20-nt-greek-law-vocabulary/CONCLUSION.md) established:

- Nomos has the widest semantic range of the five core law terms (197 NT occurrences), including at least four Pauline senses.
- Paul's four senses of nomos: (1) Torah/code, (2) Decalogue specifically, (3) operating principle/rule, (4) Scripture as witness.
- The articular/anarthrous pattern does NOT cleanly divide moral from ceremonial.

### Primary Greek Terms for "Law of ___" Phrases

1. **[G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} nomos** -- "law, custom, principle" -- 197 NT occurrences. From nemo ("to parcel out"). Semantic range includes: Torah/code, Decalogue specifically, operating principle/rule, Pentateuch as Scripture. This is the central term in every "law of ___" phrase under investigation.

## Key Research Angles

### Angle 1: "Law of Christ" (Gal 6:2; 1 Cor 9:21)

Two passages use this phrase:

**Galatians 6:2**: "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ" (ton nomon tou Christou). Key questions:
- What is the "law of Christ"? Context: Gal 5:14 says "all the law is fulfilled in...love thy neighbour." Is the "law of Christ" the same moral law fulfilled through love?
- The verb anapleroo ("fulfil/fill up") -- same root as pleroo used in 5:14. Does this indicate the same concept?
- Prior study E427 classified this as Continues. Investigate whether the text identifies ANY content for "law of Christ" that differs from the moral law.
- Does the genitive "tou Christou" mean (a) the law Christ gave, (b) the law Christ exemplified, (c) the law that belongs to Christ's kingdom, or (d) the moral law administered through Christ?

**1 Corinthians 9:21**: "To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law." Key questions:
- Paul uses three terms in one verse: anomos (without law), me on anomos theou (not being lawless toward God), ennomos Christou (within-law of Christ). This triple construction is critical.
- ennomos Christou: "in-law to Christ" or "law-bound to Christ" -- Paul is NOT lawless; he is WITHIN a law framework defined by his relationship to Christ.
- The parenthetical construction: Paul's anomos behavior toward Gentiles is limited by his NOT being anomos toward God. His relationship to God's law is expressed through his ennomos relationship to Christ.
- Does this passage teach that "law of Christ" = a replacement for the moral law, or does it teach that the moral law is now administered through/under Christ?
- Retrieve 1 Cor 9:19-23 in full context

### Angle 2: "Law of the Spirit of Life" and "Law of Sin and Death" (Rom 8:2; Rom 7:23-25)

**Romans 8:2**: "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death." Key questions:
- Prior study E401 classified both as "operating principle" (nomos = principle, not code). Verify this by examining the grammar: ho nomos tou pneumatos tes zoes vs. ho nomos tes hamartias kai tou thanatou.
- Is nomos here a body of legislation or a governing power/principle?
- The articular nomos (ho nomos) in both phrases -- does this affect the "principle" reading?
- How does this relate to the immediately following statement (8:3-4): "What the law could not do...God...condemned sin in the flesh: that the dikaioma of the law might be fulfilled in us"? The "law" in 8:3-4 is clearly the moral law. Is the "law of the Spirit" the principle by which the moral law's requirement is fulfilled?

**Romans 7:23**: "But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members." Key questions:
- Three "laws" in one verse: (a) "another law in my members," (b) "the law of my mind," (c) "the law of sin in my members."
- "Law of my mind" (tou nomou tou noos mou) -- is this the moral law as apprehended by the renewed mind? Context: v.22 "I delight in the law of God after the inward man."
- "Law of sin" (to nomo tes hamartias) -- is this a separate code or the principle of sin's power operating in the members?
- The warfare metaphor: the law of the mind vs. the law of sin. Is Paul describing two competing principles, or two competing bodies of legislation?

### Angle 3: "Law of Faith" vs. "Law of Works" (Rom 3:27)

**Romans 3:27**: "Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith." Key questions:
- Prior study E393 classified this as Neutral (nomos = principle). Verify.
- Paul asks "by what law?" (dia poiou nomou). The question itself treats "law" as a general category that can have different species: "law of works" vs. "law of faith."
- Is Paul using nomos metaphorically (as "principle/system") or is he identifying two different bodies of legislation?
- The anarthrous construction: nomos ergon vs. nomos pisteos. No article. Does this signal the "principle" sense?
- Context: v.28 "a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law"; v.31 "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." The shift from anarthrous "law of faith/works" (v.27) to articular "the law" (v.31) may signal a shift from principle to code.

### Angle 4: "Law of Liberty" (Jas 1:25; 2:12)

Law-22 analyzed this comprehensively. Key findings to REFERENCE (not re-derive):
- James identifies the "law of liberty" content as Decalogue (2:11: 6th and 7th commands) + love command (2:8: Lev 19:18)
- "Law of liberty" is a future judgment standard (2:12)
- I3 (I-D): The "new replacement law" reading was rejected because James locates the law "according to the scripture" (OT source)
- OT background: Psa 19:7 ("perfect law") and Psa 119:45 ("walk at liberty...seek thy precepts")

Law-23 should EXTEND law-22 by:
- Comparing "law of liberty" with "law of Christ" -- are they the same concept?
- Comparing James' "law of liberty" with Paul's "liberty" (eleutheria) in Galatians and 2 Corinthians
- Assessing whether all three terms ("law of Christ," "law of Spirit of life," "law of liberty") describe the same moral law under different aspects of new covenant administration

### Angle 5: "Law of Righteousness" (Rom 9:31)

**Romans 9:31**: "But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness." Key questions:
- nomon dikaiosunes -- "a law of righteousness." Anarthrous nomos with genitive dikaiosunes.
- Does this mean (a) a law that produces righteousness, (b) a law that demands righteousness, (c) a law characterized by righteousness, or (d) the righteous standard of the law?
- Context: Israel pursued this law but did not attain it. Why? v.32: "Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law." The problem is the METHOD (works vs. faith), not the law itself.
- How does this relate to Rom 10:4: "Christ is the telos of the law for righteousness"?
- No prior study has examined this specific phrase. Retrieve Rom 9:30-10:4 in full context.

### Angle 6: The Grammatical Pattern -- Anarthrous Nomos + Genitive

A systematic observation across all "law of ___" phrases:

| Phrase | Greek | Article | Reference |

| law of Christ | ton nomon tou Christou | Articular | Gal 6:2 |

Key questions:
- Does the articular/anarthrous pattern correlate with "body of law" vs. "principle"?
- When the genitive is a person (Christ, God, husband), does nomos mean "code belonging to X"?
- When the genitive is abstract (faith, works, sin, righteousness, liberty), does nomos mean "principle characterized by X"?
- Is there a consistent grammatical signal distinguishing nomos-as-code from nomos-as-principle?

### Angle 7: The "Replacement Law" Objection

The central theological question: Does the NT teach that a new "law of Christ" REPLACES the Decalogue?

Evidence to examine FOR the replacement view:
- Gal 6:2 introduces "the law of Christ" as though it is a distinct entity
- 1 Cor 9:21 distinguishes being "under the law to Christ" from being "under the law" (to Jews, v.20)
- Jn 13:34 "a new commandment I give unto you" -- does kainos indicate replacement?
- Jn 15:12 "This is my commandment, That ye love one another"
- 2 Jn 5 "a new commandment...from the beginning" -- if new AND from the beginning, is it truly new?

Evidence to examine AGAINST the replacement view:
- Prior study E427 (Gal 6:2) classified "law of Christ" as Continues
- Prior study I3/law-22 (I-D) classified "replacement law" reading of James as requiring text override
- Paul's "law of Christ" in Gal 6:2 is in the context of Gal 5:14 where "all THE law" (ho pas nomos) is fulfilled in the love command -- suggesting "law of Christ" is the moral law as administered through/by Christ
- 1 Cor 9:21: Paul explicitly states he is "not anomos to God" while being "ennomos Christou" -- his relationship to Christ does not make him lawless toward God. The two frameworks (God's law and Christ's law) are not in opposition.
- Jesus himself said "Think not that I am come to destroy the law" (Mat 5:17) and "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments" (Mat 19:17), then listed Decalogue commands.
- The "new commandment" (Jn 13:34) is the love command, which Jesus identifies as already contained in the OT (Lev 19:18; Mat 22:39). What is "new" is the exemplification ("as I have loved you"), not the moral content.

### Angle 8: Categorizing All "Law of ___" Phrases

The study should produce a systematic categorization:

**Category A: Nomos = operating principle/pattern (not a code of law)**
Candidates: law of faith, law of works, law of sin, law of sin and death, law of my mind

**Category B: Nomos = the moral law described by its new covenant relationship**
Candidates: law of Christ, law of the Spirit of life, law of liberty

**Category C: Nomos = a law-standard characterized by its quality**
Candidates: law of righteousness, law of God

The study must determine which phrases belong in which category, using contextual evidence from each passage, and assess the implications for the replacement-law objection.

## Differentiation from Prior Studies

**CRITICAL:** Law-23 is NOT a repetition of prior studies that analyzed individual "law of ___" phrases in passing. The unique contribution of law-23 is:

1. **Comprehensive Catalog**: No prior study has collected ALL NT "law of ___" genitive phrases in a single systematic analysis. Prior studies analyzed them individually within broader investigations (law-16 analyzed Rom 3:27, 7:23, 8:2 within the broader Romans study; law-17 analyzed Gal 6:2 within the broader Galatians study; law-22 analyzed Jas 1:25, 2:12 within the broader James study). Law-23 brings them all together.

2. **The Categorization Question**: No prior study has determined whether these phrases represent (a) distinct codes/bodies of law, (b) descriptions of the same moral law under different conditions, or (c) uses of nomos as "principle/rule." This is the central analytical question.

3. **The Replacement Law Argument**: No prior study has directly and comprehensively addressed the Abolished position's claim that "law of Christ" = a new replacement law superseding the Decalogue. Law-22 addressed it briefly (I3, I-D). Law-23 must examine it thoroughly using all relevant passages.

4. **The Grammatical Pattern**: No prior study has systematically analyzed the anarthrous nomos + genitive modifier construction as a distinct pattern across all occurrences.

5. **Rom 9:31 Analysis**: The "law of righteousness" phrase has received no dedicated attention in any prior study.

6. **1 Cor 9:21 Deep Analysis**: While law-14 did a word study on ennomos, no prior study has fully analyzed the triple anomos/anomos/ennomos construction in 1 Cor 9:21 and its implications for the "law of Christ" concept.

The research agent should REFERENCE prior studies' findings (do not re-derive what is already established at E/N tier) but must EXTEND the analysis by treating all "law of ___" phrases as a unified dataset requiring comparative analysis.
