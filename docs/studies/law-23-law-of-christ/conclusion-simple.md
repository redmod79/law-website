# The "Law of Christ" and Related New Testament Law Phrases

**A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence**

---

The New Testament uses several distinctive phrases that include the word "law" -- the "law of Christ" (Galatians 6:2), the "law of the Spirit of life" (Romans 8:2), the "law of liberty" (James 1:25), the "law of faith" (Romans 3:27), and the "law of my mind" (Romans 7:23). These phrases raise an important question: Do they point to a new body of legislation that replaces the Ten Commandments, or are they describing the same moral law operating under the conditions of the new covenant? This study examines every passage where these phrases appear, traces how each author defines and uses them, and asks what the Bible itself says about their content and function.

## Paul Uses the Word "Law" in More Than One Sense

Before examining the individual phrases, it is important to recognize that Paul uses the Greek word *nomos* (law) in at least two different ways within these very passages.

Sometimes he uses it to mean a governing power or operating principle -- a force that controls behavior. This is the sense in which he speaks of the "law of sin" warring in his members (Romans 7:23), the "law of faith" versus the "law of works" (Romans 3:27), and the "law of the Spirit of life" versus the "law of sin and death" (Romans 8:2). In each of these cases, two competing forces are described -- one pulling the person one direction, the other pulling the opposite way.

Other times, Paul uses "law" to mean a body of moral commands -- something you delight in, serve, and fulfill. This is the sense in which he speaks of the "law of God" that he delights in after the inward man (Romans 7:22), the "law of God" that his mind serves (Romans 7:25), and the "law of Christ" that believers fulfill by bearing one another's burdens (Galatians 6:2).

Recognizing these two senses is not a trick of interpretation. It is simply observing that the same word functions differently depending on its context -- just as "run" means something different in "run a race" and "run a business."

## What Is the "Law of Christ"?

> "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ." (Galatians 6:2)

Paul tells the Galatian believers to bear each other's burdens and in doing so "fulfil the law of Christ." The phrase uses the definite article -- it is *the* law of Christ, referring to a specific, known law. But this verse by itself does not tell us exactly which law Paul means.

The surrounding context, however, does. Just one chapter earlier, Paul wrote:

> "For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." (Galatians 5:14)

Here Paul says the entire law -- all of it -- is fulfilled in the love command drawn from Leviticus 19:18 in the Old Testament. The same verb ("fulfil") and the same concept (love expressed toward others) connects Galatians 5:14 directly to 6:2. The "law of Christ" that believers fulfill through burden-bearing is the same law that is fulfilled through love of neighbor.

In the same passage, Paul lists "works of the flesh" that include violations of the Ten Commandments -- adultery, idolatry, hatred, murders (Galatians 5:19-21). He then describes the fruit of the Spirit and adds:

> "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law." (Galatians 5:22-23)

The Spirit's fruit does not conflict with the law. The works of the flesh violate the law. The entire discussion assumes the moral law remains the standard by which conduct is measured.

## Paul Is "In-Law to Christ" and "Not Lawless Toward God"

> "To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law." (1 Corinthians 9:21)

This verse is striking because of the parenthetical clarification Paul inserts. While adapting his approach to win different audiences to the gospel, Paul clarifies his own status: he is "not without law to God" (not lawless toward God) and simultaneously "under the law to Christ" (or more literally, "in-law to Christ"). These two descriptions exist in a single clause describing the same person at the same time. Being in-law to Christ and being not lawless toward God are not opposing conditions -- they coexist.

In the same chapter, Paul actually appeals to the law of Moses as a source of ongoing principle:

> "For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn." (1 Corinthians 9:9)

Paul draws a practical principle from the Mosaic law in the same letter where he identifies himself as "in-law to Christ." He sees no contradiction between the two.

## The "Law of the Spirit of Life" and the Moral Law

> "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death." (Romans 8:2)

> "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." (Romans 8:4)

In Romans 8:2, two governing powers are contrasted: the "law of the Spirit of life" sets believers free from the "law of sin and death." These function as competing forces -- one liberates, the other enslaves.

But the passage does not stop at verse 2. Paul continues with a purpose statement in verse 4: the reason God sent His Son and condemned sin in the flesh was "that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." The righteous requirement of the moral law is the goal being achieved. The Spirit's governing power is the means by which that goal is reached.

This means the "law of the Spirit of life" is not a replacement for the moral law. It is the Spirit's power that enables believers to actually fulfill the moral law's requirements -- something the law itself could not accomplish because of the weakness of human flesh:

> "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh." (Romans 8:3)

The limitation was never in the law itself. It was in the flesh -- the human instrument that could not carry out what the law required. The Spirit now provides the power the flesh lacked.

## The "Law of Liberty" and Its Content

> "But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed." (James 1:25)

> "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty." (James 2:12)

James calls believers to live as people who will be judged by the "law of liberty." This is not an abstract idea for James. He specifies exactly what this law contains:

> "If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well." (James 2:8)

> "For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law." (James 2:11)

James identifies the content of the "law of liberty" as the love command from Leviticus 19:18 ("according to the scripture") and specific commands from the Ten Commandments -- "Do not commit adultery" and "Do not kill." The law of liberty is not a vague spiritual concept. It has identifiable content, and that content is drawn from the Old Testament moral law. James also affirms that there is one lawgiver -- God (James 4:12).

## The "New Commandment" That Is Also Old

> "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another." (John 13:34)

Jesus calls the love command "new." But John later explains what he means by this:

> "Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth." (1 John 2:7-8)

> "Not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. And this is love, that we walk after his commandments." (2 John 1:5-6)

The same author -- John -- describes the same commandment as both "old" (from the beginning) and "new." It is old in its content (love of neighbor, which existed from the beginning) and new in its quality (now demonstrated and empowered through Christ). John then connects this love command to walking "after his commandments," tying it back to obedience to God's existing commands.

## Faith Establishes the Law

> "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." (Romans 3:31)

Paul asks the question directly and answers with the strongest possible denial: "God forbid." Faith does not void the law. It establishes it. This statement appears in the same passage where Paul uses the phrase "law of faith" (Romans 3:27), showing that even his discussion of faith's role does not lead him to set aside the law.

## Every Content Identification Points the Same Direction

Across the New Testament, whenever an author specifies the actual content of one of these "law of ___" phrases, the content is always identified as the moral law, the Ten Commandments, or the love command from Leviticus 19:18. This pattern is consistent across multiple authors:

- Paul identifies the content of the "law of Christ" context as "all the law" fulfilled in the love command (Galatians 5:14).
- Paul identifies the "law of God" he delights in as the law that says "Thou shalt not covet" -- the tenth commandment (Romans 7:7, 22).
- James identifies the content of the "law of liberty" as the love command (James 2:8) and specific Decalogue commands (James 2:11).
- John identifies the "new commandment" as the command "from the beginning" connected to walking after God's commandments (2 John 1:5-6).

No New Testament passage identifies different content for any of these phrases. No author lists an alternative set of commands that replaces the Ten Commandments.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

Honest study requires acknowledging what the text does not explicitly state:

1. No single verse says in so many words that "the law of Christ is the moral law under new covenant administration." That conclusion requires putting together the evidence from multiple passages. It is a strong conclusion supported by all the available evidence, but it is a synthesis rather than a direct quotation.

2. No passage explicitly states that the "law of the Spirit of life" IS the moral law. The evidence indicates it is the Spirit's governing power that enables the moral law's requirements to be fulfilled -- a related but distinct concept.

3. The debate over what Paul means by "not under the law" in various passages is not fully resolved by these phrases alone. The meaning of that expression depends on context and on which sense of "law" Paul is using in each case.

4. While every content identification points to the moral law, the phrase "law of Christ" itself (Galatians 6:2) does not explicitly define its own content within that single verse. The identification comes from the surrounding context in Galatians 5:14.

## Conclusion

The biblical evidence consistently points in one direction. The "law of Christ," the "law of the Spirit of life," the "law of liberty," and the "new commandment" are not new codes of legislation replacing the Ten Commandments. They are descriptions of how the same moral law functions under the new covenant: the law of Christ is the moral law as it belongs to and is fulfilled through Christ; the law of the Spirit of life is the Spirit's power enabling believers to fulfill the moral law's requirements; the law of liberty is the moral law as experienced by those freed from sin's dominion; and the new commandment is the ancient love command renewed in quality through Christ's example.

Every time the New Testament specifies the content of these phrases, it identifies the moral law and the love command from the Old Testament. No replacement code is ever described, listed, or introduced. Paul affirms he is not lawless toward God while being in-law to Christ. James roots the law of liberty in the Decalogue and the Old Testament scriptures. John says the new commandment is the old one from the beginning. And Paul declares that faith does not void the law but establishes it. The law remains -- not as a means of earning salvation, but as the standard of righteousness that the Spirit now empowers believers to fulfill.
