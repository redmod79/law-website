## Question
What is the "law of Christ" (Gal 6:2), the "law of the Spirit of life" (Rom 8:2), and the "law of liberty" (Jas 1:25)? Are these new laws replacing the Ten Commandments, or are they the moral law under a new covenant administration? Investigate every NT phrase that names a "law of ___": law of Christ (Gal 6:2, 1 Cor 9:21), law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus (Rom 8:2), law of liberty (Jas 1:25, 2:12), law of faith (Rom 3:27), law of sin and death (Rom 7:23-25, Rom 8:2), law of my mind (Rom 7:23), law of righteousness (Rom 9:31). Determine whether these are distinct codes/bodies of law, descriptions of how the same moral law functions under different conditions, or uses of "law" (nomos) as "principle/rule."
