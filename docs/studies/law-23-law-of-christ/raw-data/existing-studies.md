# Existing Studies -- Prior Findings Relevant to law-23

## law-16: Paul and Law in Romans

**Key findings directly relevant:**
- N080: Paul uses nomos in at least four distinct senses: (1) Torah/code, (2) Decalogue specifically, (3) operating principle/pattern, (4) Pentateuch as Scripture-witness
- E393 (Rom 3:27): "law of works" vs. "law of faith" -- nomos = operating principle. Classified Neutral.
- E401 (Rom 8:2): "law of the Spirit of life" vs. "law of sin and death" -- two principles. Classified Neutral.
- E399 (Rom 7:22): "I delight in the law of God after the inward man." Classified Continues.
- E400 (Rom 7:25): "With the mind I serve the law of God; with the flesh the law of sin." Classified Continues.
- I105 (I-B): Claim that Paul abolishes moral law in Romans resolved Strong against abolition (FOR: 3 Ambiguous; AGAINST: 11 Plain + 1 Contextually Clear).

## law-17: Paul and Law in Galatians

**Key findings directly relevant:**
- E427 (Gal 6:2): "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ." Classified Continues.

- E426 (Gal 5:22-23): Fruit of the Spirit consistent with the law. Classified Continues.
- N086: Specific controversy in Galatians is circumcision/ceremonial, not moral law.
- N087: Paul affirms moral law's content while denying justificatory power.
- N088: Paul distinguishes circumcision (dismissed) from "commandments of God" (affirmed) in 1 Cor 7:19.
- I110 (I-B): Claim that Galatians abolishes moral law resolved Strong against abolition.

## law-22: James and the Law

**Key findings directly relevant:**
- E1 (Jas 1:25): "The perfect law of liberty" -- complete and brings freedom. Classified Continues.
- E6 (Jas 2:12): "Law of liberty" = future judgment standard. Classified Continues.
- N1: James identifies content of "royal law" and "law of liberty" as including Lev 19:18 and Decalogue (Exo 20:13-14).
- N7: James never cites ceremonial or civil laws as part of "royal law" or "law of liberty."
- I3 (I-D): "Replacement law" reading rejected -- requires overriding James' "according to the scripture."

## law-14: Jesus' Law Teachings

**Key findings directly relevant:**
- [G1772](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1772/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} ennomos word study: 2 NT occurrences -- Acts 19:39 ("lawful assembly") and 1 Cor 9:21 ("ennomos Christou"). Paul as "in-law to Christ."

## law-10: New Covenant and Law

- Paul's four senses of nomos: (1) Torah/code, (2) Decalogue, (3) principle/rule, (4) Scripture as witness.
- Articular/anarthrous pattern does NOT cleanly divide moral from ceremonial.

- N1: Entole without qualifier is never used for abolished ceremonial regulation.
- N2: Dogma is never used for God's moral commandments.
- N3: NT vocabulary in affirmation passages differs from vocabulary in abolition passages.
- I1 (I-A): NT vocabulary encodes systematic moral/ceremonial distinction.

## What Has NOT Been Done (unique contribution of law-23)

1. No prior study has collected ALL NT "law of ___" genitive phrases in one systematic analysis
2. No prior study has determined whether these phrases represent distinct codes, same moral law under different conditions, or uses of nomos as "principle"
3. No prior study has comprehensively addressed the "replacement law" argument
4. No prior study has analyzed anarthrous nomos + genitive modifier as a distinct grammatical pattern
5. No prior study has given dedicated attention to Rom 9:31 ("law of righteousness")
6. No prior study has fully analyzed the triple anomos/anomos/ennomos construction in 1 Cor 9:21
