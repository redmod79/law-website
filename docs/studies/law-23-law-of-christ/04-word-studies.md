## Question
What is the "law of Christ" (Gal 6:2), the "law of the Spirit of life" (Rom 8:2), and the "law of liberty" (Jas 1:25)? Are these new laws replacing the Ten Commandments, or are they the moral law under a new covenant administration?

## [G1772](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1772/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- ennomos (within law, lawful)

**Original:** énnomos
**Transliteration:** ennomos
**Part of Speech:** Adjective
**Definition:** From en (G1722) + nomos (G3551); (subjectively) legal, or (objectively) subject to law
**BLB Count:** 2 NT occurrences

### Translations
| Translation | Count | Verse |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| lawful | 1 | Acts 19:39 |
| under the law | 1 | 1 Cor 9:21 |

### Key Verses
- **Acts 19:39** -- "it shall be determined in a lawful (ennomos) assembly" -- legal, proper, within-law
- **1 Cor 9:21** -- "being not without law (anomos) to God, but under the law (ennomos) to Christ" -- literally "in-law to Christ" or "within-law of Christ"

### Significance for "Law of Christ"
The compound adjective ennomos = en + nomos literally means "in law" or "within the sphere of law." When Paul says he is ennomos Christou, he places himself inside a law-framework defined by his relationship to Christ. This is not anomia (lawlessness) -- it is a positive law-relationship.

## [G459](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g459/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- anomos (without law, lawless)

**Original:** ánomos
**Transliteration:** anomos
**Part of Speech:** Adjective
**Definition:** From alpha-privative + nomos; lawless, not subject to law
**BLB Count:** 10 NT occurrences

### Translations
| Translation | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| the transgressors | 2 |
| without law | 2 |
| wicked | 2 |
| that are without law / them that are without law | 2 |
| for the lawless | 1 |
| unlawful | 1 |

### Key Verse: 1 Cor 9:21 -- Triple Construction
Greek: tois anomois hos anomos, me on anomos theou all' ennomos Christou, hina kerdano tous anomous

The verse contains four uses of anomos/ennomos:
1. **tois anomois** (Dat Pl M) -- "to those without law" (the Gentile audience)
2. **hos anomos** (Nom Sg M) -- "as [one] without law" (Paul's adaptation)
3. **me on anomos theou** (Nom Sg M + Gen) -- "not being lawless toward God" (Paul's caveat)
4. **ennomos Christou** (Nom Sg M + Gen) -- "in-law to Christ" (Paul's actual status)

Paul's self-description: He is NOT anomos theou (not lawless toward God) but rather ennomos Christou (within-law to Christ). His relationship to Christ is the framework of his law-keeping, not the negation of law.

## [G1657](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1657/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- eleutheria (liberty, freedom)

**Original:** eleuthería
**Transliteration:** eleutheria
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** From eleutheros (G1658, "free"); freedom, legitimate or licentious, chiefly moral or ceremonial
**BLB Count:** 11 NT occurrences (all translated "liberty")

### All Occurrences
| Verse | Text |
|-------|------|
| Rom 8:21 | "the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God" |
| 1 Cor 10:29 | "why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?" |
| 2 Cor 3:17 | "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" |
| Gal 2:4 | "to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus" |
| Gal 5:1 | "Stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free" |
| Gal 5:13 | "ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh" |
| Jas 1:25 | "the perfect law of liberty" |
| Jas 2:12 | "judged by the law of liberty" |
| 1 Pet 2:16 | "not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness" |
| 2 Pet 2:19 | "While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption" |

### Significance
The term appears in both Pauline and non-Pauline writings. The connection between Spirit and liberty (2 Cor 3:17; Rom 8:2,21) links the "law of the Spirit of life" to the "law of liberty" -- both involve Spirit-empowered freedom. James' "law of liberty" uses the same noun (eleutheria) that Paul associates with Christ (Gal 2:4; 5:1) and the Spirit (2 Cor 3:17).

## [G4102](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4102/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- pistis (faith)

**Original:** pístis
**Transliteration:** pistis
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** From peitho ("to persuade"); persuasion, credence, moral conviction of religious truth
**BLB Count:** 244 NT occurrences

### Key Verse: Rom 3:27
"By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law (nomos) of faith (pisteos, Gen Sg F)."

The genitive pisteos modifies nomos. Paul asks "by what kind (poiou) of law?" -- treating nomos as a category with species. The "law/principle of faith" excludes boasting; the "law/principle of works" would permit it.

---

## [G5046](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5046/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- teleios (perfect, complete)

**Original:** téleios
**Transliteration:** teleios
**Part of Speech:** Adjective
**Definition:** From telos (G5056, "end, goal"); complete in various applications -- of labor, growth, mental and moral character
**BLB Count:** 19 NT occurrences

### Key Verse: Jas 1:25
Greek: eis nomon teleion ton tes eleutherias
"Into [the] law perfect, that of liberty"

teleion is Acc Sg M, modifying nomon. The law is described as "perfect" (complete, reaching its goal). This echoes Psalm 19:7: "The law of the LORD is perfect (tamim), converting the soul."

---

## [G937](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g937/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- basilikos (royal, kingly)

**Original:** basilikós
**Transliteration:** basilikos
**Part of Speech:** Adjective
**Definition:** From basileus (G935, "king"); regal, belonging to or befitting a king
**BLB Count:** 5 NT occurrences

### All Occurrences
| Verse | Translation |
|-------|------------|
| John 4:46 | nobleman (lit. royal one) |
| John 4:49 | nobleman |
| Acts 12:20 | king's [country] |
| Acts 12:21 | royal [apparel] |
| **James 2:8** | **royal [law]** |

### Significance
James 2:8 is the only use of basilikos for a law. The "royal law" (nomon basilikon) is identified as "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" -- Lev 19:18. This is the same content identified with the "law of liberty" (2:12), linking the two designations.

## [G1343](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1343/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- dikaiosune (righteousness)

**Original:** dikaiosýne
**Transliteration:** dikaiosune
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** From dikaios (G1342); equity of character or act; Christian justification
**BLB Count:** 92 NT occurrences

### Key Verse: Rom 9:31
Greek: nomon dikaiosunes -- "a law of righteousness" (anarthrous nomos + genitive)
Israel pursued this "law of righteousness" but did not attain it -- because they pursued it by works rather than by faith (9:32). The problem was the method, not the standard.

---

## [G266](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g266/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- hamartia (sin)

**Original:** hamartía
**Transliteration:** hamartia
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** From hamartano (G264); sin, properly abstract -- an offence, sinful act
**BLB Count:** 174 NT occurrences

### Key Verses
- **Rom 7:23** -- "the law (nomos) of sin (tes hamartias)" -- the governing principle of sin operating in the members
- **Rom 7:25** -- "with the flesh the law of sin (nomo hamartias)"
- **Rom 8:2** -- "the law of sin (tes hamartias) and death (tou thanatou)"
- **1 John 3:4** -- "sin (hamartia) is the transgression of the law (anomia)" -- sin defined as lawlessness

---

## [G3563](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3563/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- nous (mind)

**Original:** noûs
**Transliteration:** nous
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Definition:** Probably from base of ginosko; the intellect, mind (divine or human)
**BLB Count:** 24 NT occurrences

### Key Verse: Rom 7:23
Greek: to nomo tou noos mou -- "the law of my mind"
The "law of my mind" is the governing principle of the renewed mind, which wars against the "law of sin in my members." Context (7:22): "I delight in the law of God after the inward man" -- the law of the mind is the moral law as apprehended and delighted in by the inner man.

---

## [G2288](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2288/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- thanatos (death)

**Original:** thánatos
**Transliteration:** thanatos
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Definition:** From thnesko; death (literally or figuratively)
**BLB Count:** 119 NT occurrences

### Key Verse: Rom 8:2
"The law of sin and death (tou thanatou)" -- death paired with sin as the governing principle from which the Spirit's law frees believers. Compare Rom 6:23: "The wages of sin is death."

---

## [G2041](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2041/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- ergon (work, deed)

**Original:** érgon
**Transliteration:** ergon
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**Definition:** From ergo ("to work"); toil as an effort or occupation
**BLB Count:** 176 NT occurrences

### Key Verse: Rom 3:27
Greek: nomos ergon -- "law of works" (anarthrous, genitive plural)
The "works" principle is contrasted with the "faith" principle. Boasting is excluded not by the works-principle but by the faith-principle.

---

## [G458](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g458/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- anomia (lawlessness, iniquity)

**Original:** anomía
**Transliteration:** anomia
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** From anomos (G459); illegality, violation of law, or wickedness
**BLB Count:** 15 NT occurrences

### Translations
| Translation | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| iniquity | 7 |
| iniquities | 3 |
| unrighteousness | 1 |
| to iniquity | 1 |
| of iniquity | 1 |

### Key Verse: 1 John 3:4
"Sin (hamartia) is the transgression of the law (anomia)." Literally: "sin is lawlessness." If the "law of Christ" replaced the Decalogue, then sin would need to be redefined as violating the "law of Christ." But John defines sin as anomia -- the absence of nomos -- which presupposes a continuing standard of law.

---

## [G2537](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2537/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- kainos (new)

**Original:** kainós
**Transliteration:** kainos
**Part of Speech:** Adjective
**Definition:** Of uncertain affinity; new (especially in freshness; contrasted with neos which is new in time)
**BLB Count:** 44 NT occurrences

### Key Verses
- **Jn 13:34** -- "A new (kainen) commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another"
- **2 Jn 1:5** -- "not as though I wrote a new (kainen) commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning"
- **1 Jn 2:7** -- "Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning"

### Significance
Kainos means new in quality or character, not new in time (that would be neos). The "new commandment" of love is kainos in its exemplification ("as I have loved you"), not in its moral content (which is "from the beginning" -- Lev 19:18). 2 John 1:5 explicitly says the "new commandment" is "that which we had from the beginning."

---

## [G3550](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3550/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- nomothetes (lawgiver)

**Original:** nomothetes
**Transliteration:** nomothetes
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Definition:** From nomos + tithemi ("to place"); a lawgiver
**BLB Count:** 1 NT occurrence (hapax legomenon)

### Key Verse: James 4:12
"There is one lawgiver (nomothetes), who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?"

### Significance
James identifies one lawgiver -- God. This is the same author who writes of "the perfect law of liberty" (1:25), "the royal law" (2:8), and "the law of liberty" (2:12). The single lawgiver behind all these law-designations is God, not a replacement human authority. If the "law of liberty" were a new replacement law, James would need to identify a new lawgiver -- but he affirms there is only one.
