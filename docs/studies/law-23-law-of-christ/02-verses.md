> **6:6** Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
> **6:7** Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
> **6:8** For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
> **6:12** As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
> **6:13** For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
> **6:15** For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

> **8:4** That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
> **8:5** For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
