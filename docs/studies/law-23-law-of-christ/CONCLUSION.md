# CONCLUSION — law-23: The "Law of Christ" and Related NT Law Phrases

## Study Question

What is the "law of Christ" (Gal 6:2), the "law of the Spirit of life" (Rom 8:2), and the "law of liberty" (Jas 1:25)? Are these new laws replacing the Ten Commandments, or are they the moral law under a new covenant administration? Do these phrases represent distinct codes, descriptions of how the same moral law functions under different conditions, or uses of nomos as "principle/rule"?

---

## Summary Answer

The "law of Christ" (Gal 6:2), the "law of the Spirit of life" (Rom 8:2), and the "law of liberty" (Jas 1:25) are not new codes replacing the Decalogue but are descriptions of the moral law functioning under new covenant conditions: the same law, now written on the heart by the Spirit (Jer 31:33; Ezek 36:27) and fulfilled through love (Gal 5:14; Rom 13:8-10). Every NT passage that specifies the content of a "law of ___" phrase identifies that content as the moral law and/or the love command from Lev 19:18 (Gal 5:14; Jas 2:8-11; Rom 7:22 with 7:7) — no passage lists a different content for any replacement code. Paul confirms the continuity himself: he is simultaneously "not without law to God" and "under the law to Christ" (1 Cor 9:21), the Spirit's governing power operates so that "the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us" (Rom 8:4), and faith does not void the law but establishes it (Rom 3:31).

## 1. Explicit Statements

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Position |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Paul states: "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ" (ton nomon tou Christou). The "law of Christ" is a specific, known law (articular accusative) that is fulfilled through bearing burdens. | Gal 6:2 | Neutral |
| E2 | Paul states: "For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." The entire law (ho pas nomos) is fulfilled (peplerōtai, Perfect Passive) in the love command from Lev 19:18. | Gal 5:14 | Neutral |
| E3 | Paul states: "To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law." Paul identifies himself as simultaneously NOT anomos theou (not lawless toward God) and ennomos Christou (in-law to Christ). | 1 Cor 9:21 | Neutral |
| E4 | Paul states: "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death." Two governing dynamics are named: one produces freedom through the Spirit, the other governed through sin and death. | Rom 8:2 | Neutral |
| E5 | Paul states: "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." The dikaiōma (righteous requirement) of the law is fulfilled in Spirit-walkers. | Rom 8:4 | Continues |
| E6 | Paul states: "But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members." Three "laws" (governing powers) are identified: (a) a law in the members, (b) the law of the mind, (c) the law of sin. | Rom 7:23 | Neutral |
| E7 | Paul states: "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man." The "law of God" is the object of delight for the inward man. | Rom 7:22 | Continues |
| E8 | Paul states: "With the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin." The mind serves God's law; the flesh serves sin's principle. Two allegiances in present tense. | Rom 7:25 | Continues |
| E9 | Paul asks: "By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith." Paul uses poiou (qualitative interrogative: "what kind of") to distinguish two kinds of nomos: nomos ergōn (works-principle) and nomos pisteōs (faith-principle). | Rom 3:27 | Neutral |
| E10 | Paul states: "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." In the same passage where he uses "law of faith" (3:27), Paul affirms that faith establishes (histēmi) the law (articular ho nomos). | Rom 3:31 | Continues |
| E11 | Paul states: "But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law." Israel's failure was in method (works vs. faith), not in the law's content. | Rom 9:31-32 | Neutral |
| E12 | James states: "Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed." The "perfect law of liberty" is looked into, continued in, and produces blessing through doing. | Jas 1:25 | Continues |
| E13 | James states: "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty." The "law of liberty" is a standard of future judgment. | Jas 2:12 | Continues |
| E14 | James states: "If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well." The "royal law" is Lev 19:18, sourced "according to the scripture." | Jas 2:8 | Continues |
| E15 | James states: "For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill." James identifies the 6th and 7th Decalogue commands as content of the law (in the same passage as "law of liberty," 2:12). | Jas 2:11 | Continues |
| E16 | Paul states: "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." The carnal mind cannot be subject to God's law. | Rom 8:7 | Continues |
| E17 | Jesus states: "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another." The word "new" is kainos (G2537, new in quality), not neos (new in time). | Jn 13:34 | Neutral |
| E18 | John states: "Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning...Again, a new commandment I write unto you." The love commandment is simultaneously "old" (from the beginning) and "new." | 1 Jn 2:7-8 | Continues |
| E19 | John states: "Not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. And this is love, that we walk after his commandments." The "new commandment" is identified as "from the beginning" and is connected to walking "after his commandments." | 2 Jn 1:5-6 | Continues |
| E20 | Paul appeals to "the law of Moses" as authoritative in the same chapter where he describes himself as ennomos Christou: "It is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn" (1 Cor 9:9). Paul extracts an ongoing principle from the Mosaic law. | 1 Cor 9:9 | Neutral |
| E21 | James states: "There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy." One lawgiver — God. James uses the hapax nomothetes (G3550). | Jas 4:12 | Neutral |
| E22 | Paul states: "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh." The law's limitation was in the flesh (the instrument), not in the law itself. | Rom 8:3 | Continues |
| E23 | Paul lists "works of the flesh" that include Decalogue violations: "Adultery, fornication...idolatry...hatred...murders" (Gal 5:19-21) in the same context as "all the law is fulfilled in...love" (5:14) and "fulfil the law of Christ" (6:2). | Gal 5:19-21 | Neutral |
| E24 | Paul states: "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law." The Spirit's fruit does not violate the law. | Gal 5:22-23 | Continues |
| E25 | Paul states: "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God." Paul distinguishes circumcision (ceremonial, dismissed) from "commandments of God" (affirmed). | 1 Cor 7:19 | Continues |

### E-Item Positional Classification (Tree 3 applied)

**E1 (Gal 6:2 — "fulfil the law of Christ"):**
- V1: "fulfil the law" uses continuation vocabulary (law is being kept/fulfilled). But the phrase "law of Christ" does not by itself identify WHICH law (moral or new replacement). → Candidate Continues
- Gate 1 (Referent): The verse does not specify whether "the law of Christ" = the moral law or a replacement law. The referent is ambiguous from this verse alone. → FAIL
- Step 3 (RC): Corrected observation: "Paul states believers are to fulfil 'the law of Christ' — a specific law (articular) — but the verse does not by itself identify whether this is the moral law or a separate code." Re-enter V1/V2: neither continuation nor cessation vocabulary unambiguously applies without identifying the referent. → **Neutral**

**E2 (Gal 5:14):** V1: "all the law is fulfilled" — continuation vocabulary (the entire law remains the standard fulfilled through love). Gate 1: PASS — "all the law" (ho pas nomos) is the entire Torah/moral law. Gate 2: PASS — grammar is unambiguous. Gate 3: PASS — didactic. Gate 4: PASS — consistent with Rom 13:8-10 (E028). → **Neutral** (both sides agree love fulfills the law; the debate is about whether the law continues as a standard, which this verse addresses indirectly). However, the verb "is fulfilled" (peplerōtai, Perfect Passive) states the law IS fulfilled (present reality), not that it WAS fulfilled and discarded. This is continuation vocabulary. → **Continues** on re-examination. Reclassify: the fact that Paul says ALL the law is fulfilled (not "was fulfilled and removed") in love is continuation language — the law remains as the standard love fulfills. → **Neutral** — both sides can accept this as a textual observation (Abolished says "fulfilled = completed and done"; Continues says "fulfilled = enacted in practice"). The positional implication depends on interpreting "fulfilled." → **Neutral**

**E3 (1 Cor 9:21 — ennomos Christou, not anomos theou):**
- V1: "not without law to God" uses continuation vocabulary — Paul is not lawless toward God.
- Gate 1: The referent of "law" is identified by the contrast: anomos theou = lawless toward God, ennomos Christou = in-law to Christ. "God's law" is the referent of what Paul is NOT lawless toward. But whether this means the moral law specifically or law in general is not specified. → Contextually: anomos theou in a Pauline epistle where nomos = the moral law (same author, Rom 7:22,25; 8:7 — "law of God" = Decalogue) passes Gate 1 by same-author contextual identification.
- Gate 2: PASS — grammar is clear.
- Gate 3: PASS — didactic.
- Gate 4: PASS — consistent with same-author E-items (E398, E399, E027).
- The observation that Paul is "not anomos theou" (not lawless toward God) while being "ennomos Christou" states these two conditions coexist. This is a textual fact both sides must accept. → **Neutral** (both sides agree Paul is not lawless; the debate is about what "anomos theou" and "ennomos Christou" entail)

**E4 (Rom 8:2):**
- V1/V2: The verse uses "made free from" (cessation vocabulary for the "law of sin and death") but the "law of the Spirit of life" is not cessation of the moral law — it is freedom from sin's power. Neither continuation nor cessation vocabulary is applied to the moral law itself. → **Neutral**

**E5 (Rom 8:4 — dikaiōma of the law fulfilled in Spirit-walkers):**
- V1: "The righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us" uses continuation vocabulary — the moral law's righteous requirement is being fulfilled (present, ongoing).
- Gate 1: PASS — "the law" (tou nomou) in 8:3-4 is the moral law (same context as 7:7-12 where the 10th commandment is quoted).
- Gate 2: PASS — grammar unambiguous.
- Gate 3: PASS — didactic.
- Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E026, E028.
- → **Continues**

**E7 (Rom 7:22), E8 (Rom 7:25), E16 (Rom 8:7):** Already established in evidence DB as E397, E398, E027. → **Continues**

**E9 (Rom 3:27):** Already established as E392. → **Neutral**

**E10 (Rom 3:31):** Already established as E025. → **Continues**

**E11 (Rom 9:31-32):** New item. V1/V2: The verse does not use continuation or cessation vocabulary applied to the moral law. Israel's pursuit failed due to method (works vs. faith), not because the law was wrong. → **Neutral**

**E12 (Jas 1:25), E13 (Jas 2:12), E14 (Jas 2:8), E15 (Jas 2:11):** Already established as E029, E460. → **Continues**

**E17 (Jn 13:34 — "new commandment"):** V1/V2: "New commandment" could support cessation (new replacing old) or be neutral (kainos = new in quality). Gate 1: The referent is the love command, not the Decalogue itself. → **Neutral** (the observation that Jesus gives a "new" commandment is a textual fact; what "new" means is interpretive)

**E18 (1 Jn 2:7-8), E19 (2 Jn 1:5-6):** Already established as E348, E349. → **Continues** (the "new commandment" is explicitly stated to be "from the beginning" — continuity)

**E21 (Jas 4:12 — one lawgiver):** V1/V2: The observation that there is one lawgiver does not by itself use continuation or cessation vocabulary. → **Neutral**

**E22 (Rom 8:3):** Already established as E285. → **Continues** (law's limitation is in the flesh, not in the law)

**E24 (Gal 5:22-23):** Already established as E426. → **Continues** (Spirit's fruit does not violate the law)

**E25 (1 Cor 7:19):** Already established as E143. → **Continues**

## 2. Necessary Implications

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable | Position |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | Paul uses nomos in the "law of ___" phrases in at least two distinct senses: (1) operating principle/governing power (Rom 3:27 "law of faith/works"; Rom 7:23 "law of sin/my mind"; Rom 8:2 "law of Spirit of life/sin and death") and (2) body of moral obligation (Gal 6:2 "law of Christ"; Rom 7:22,25 "law of God"). This is observable from the contextual functions: principles compete and govern; codes are fulfilled, delighted in, and served. | E1, E4, E6, E7, E8, E9 | Both senses are used by the same author (Paul) in proximate contexts. The "law of sin in my members" (E6) is a force taking captive; the "law of God" (E7) is delighted in and served. No reader can deny these are different senses of the same word. | Neutral |
| N2 | The "law of my mind" (Rom 7:23) is contextually identified as the moral law as apprehended by the renewed mind, because v.22 states "I delight in the law of God after the inward man" and v.25 states "with the mind I serve the law of God." The law of the mind = the law of God as the mind knows it. | E6, E7, E8 | Three consecutive verses: v.22 identifies the inward man's object as "the law of God"; v.23 names "the law of my mind" as the target the sin-law wars against; v.25 states the mind serves "the law of God." The referent is the same in all three. | Continues |
| N3 | The "law of the Spirit of life" (Rom 8:2) is the governing power that enables the fulfillment of the moral law's dikaiōma (righteous requirement), because the argument from 8:2 to 8:4 runs: the Spirit's law sets free from sin's law (8:2) → God condemned sin in the flesh (8:3) → SO THAT (hina) the dikaiōma of the law might be fulfilled in Spirit-walkers (8:4). The purpose clause (hina) connects the Spirit's freeing work to the moral law's fulfillment. | E4, E5, E22 | The hina clause in 8:4 states the PURPOSE of what was described in 8:2-3. The Spirit sets free FROM sin's law → FOR the law's righteous requirement to be fulfilled. This purpose connection is grammatical, not interpretive. | Continues |
| N4 | Paul's ennomos Christou (in-law to Christ, 1 Cor 9:21) is compatible with — not opposed to — his relationship to God's law, because the same parenthetical states "not being anomos theou" (not lawless toward God). The two genitives (theou, Christou) describe concurrent realities. | E3 | The parenthetical mē ōn anomos theou all' ennomos Christou is a single adversative clause: "not X but Y." The "not lawless toward God" and the "in-law to Christ" describe the SAME person at the SAME time. | Neutral |
| N5 | Every NT passage that identifies specific content for a "law of ___" phrase identifies that content as the moral law/Decalogue and/or the love command from Lev 19:18. No NT passage identifies content for any "law of ___" phrase that differs from these. | E1→E2 (Gal 6:2→5:14), E12→E14→E15 (Jas 1:25→2:8→2:11), E7→Rom 7:7 (10th cmd) | Gal 6:2's contextual content = Gal 5:14 (Lev 19:18); Jas 2:12's contextual content = 2:8 (Lev 19:18) + 2:11 (Decalogue); Rom 7:22's contextual content = 7:7 (10th commandment). These are all the passages that specify content. The observation is: in every case where the text specifies content, it specifies the moral law. | Continues |
| N6 | John's "new commandment" (Jn 13:34) is simultaneously old in content and new in quality, because John explicitly states it is "an old commandment which ye had from the beginning" (1 Jn 2:7) and "that which we had from the beginning" (2 Jn 1:5), while also calling it "a new commandment" (1 Jn 2:8; Jn 13:34). | E17, E18, E19 | The SAME author (John) applies both "old/from the beginning" and "new" to the SAME commandment in the SAME epistles. Both descriptions are explicit. The conclusion that it is simultaneously old in content and new in quality is the only way to reconcile both statements by the same author. | Continues |
| N7 | Israel's failure to attain the "law of righteousness" (Rom 9:31) was a failure of METHOD, not a defect in the law, because Paul states the reason: "Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law" (9:32). The problem is in the approach (works vs. faith), which the text itself identifies. | E11 | Paul himself provides the explanation in the verse immediately following. The "wherefore?" (9:32a) and its answer ("because... not by faith, but by works") is the text's own diagnosis. | Neutral |

### N-Item Verification (Tree 4, Gate 0)

**N1:** N-Test 1 (Universal): Would an Abolished scholar agree Paul uses nomos in two senses? Yes — both sides recognize the "principle" sense in Rom 3:27 and 7:23. N-Test 2: Only one possible conclusion — the contexts functionally distinguish the senses. N-Test 3: No added concepts. → PASS. Neutral — both sides accept this observation.

**N2:** N-Test 1: Would an Abolished scholar agree that "law of my mind" in 7:23 = "law of God" from 7:22,25? The three-verse sequence makes this unavoidable. Yes. N-Test 2: Only one conclusion — the referent is the same across these consecutive verses. N-Test 3: No added concepts. → PASS. Continues — because the moral law is what the mind serves (7:25).

**N3:** N-Test 1: Would an Abolished scholar agree the hina clause connects 8:2 to 8:4? The grammar forces this. The question is whether "dikaiōma of the law" means the moral law's requirement. In the same context (7:7-12), Paul quotes the 10th commandment. Both sides must accept the hina clause connects the Spirit's freeing work to the law's fulfillment. N-Test 2: The grammatical connection is unambiguous. N-Test 3: No added concepts. → PASS. Continues — because the text states the Spirit's work results in the moral law being fulfilled in believers (ongoing).

**N4:** N-Test 1: Would an Abolished scholar agree that "not anomos theou" and "ennomos Christou" coexist in Paul? Yes — the parenthetical states both. N-Test 2: Only one conclusion — the parenthetical is a single adversative clause. N-Test 3: No added concepts. → PASS. Neutral — both sides accept the textual observation; the debate is about what each entails.

**N5:** N-Test 1: Would an Abolished scholar agree that every content-identification points to moral law/Decalogue? The texts quoted (Gal 5:14; Jas 2:8,11; Rom 7:7) are explicit. An Abolished scholar could argue that the content is similar but the CODE is new. However, the observation is that the text identifies the content — and this observation is factual. N-Test 2: Only one conclusion from the cited texts. N-Test 3: No concepts added. → PASS. Continues — because this observation shows the identified content is the moral law, which is continuation evidence.

**N6:** N-Test 1: Would an Abolished scholar agree the love command is both old and new per John? The texts state both explicitly. Yes. N-Test 2: Only one conclusion. N-Test 3: No added concepts. → PASS. Continues — because the "new commandment" is explicitly identified as having pre-existing content ("from the beginning").

**N7:** N-Test 1: Would an Abolished scholar agree the failure was in method? Paul states this explicitly. Yes. N-Test 2: Only one conclusion. N-Test 3: No added concepts. → PASS. Neutral — both sides can accept this as a textual observation.

## 3. Inferences

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | The "law of Christ" (Gal 6:2) is a new body of legislation replacing the Decalogue. | I-D | Paul says "fulfil the law of Christ" (E1, Gal 6:2). The immediate context identifies "all the law" fulfilled in the love command (E2, Gal 5:14). John says the love command is "from the beginning" (E19, 2 Jn 1:5). James identifies the "law of liberty" content as Decalogue + love command "according to the scripture" (E14-E15, Jas 2:8-11). Paul says he is "not lawless toward God" while "in-law to Christ" (E3, 1 Cor 9:21). No NT passage specifies any content for the "law of Christ" that differs from the moral law (N5). | This claim requires: (a) overriding Gal 5:14's identification of the content as "all the law" fulfilled in love, (b) overriding John's statement that the love command is "from the beginning" (E18, E19), (c) overriding James' identification of "law of liberty" content as Decalogue + love command from OT scripture (E14, E15), (d) supplying content for the replacement law that no NT text provides. | #1 (adding concept not stated: replacement content), #3 (external theological framework: replacement-law theory) |
| I2 | The "law of Christ" is the moral law as administered through the new covenant in Christ — the same law, under a new relationship. | I-A | Paul says "fulfil the law of Christ" (E1, Gal 6:2); contextual content = "all the law" fulfilled in love (E2, Gal 5:14 → Lev 19:18); Paul is "not anomos theou" while "ennomos Christou" (E3, 1 Cor 9:21); the Spirit enables the law's dikaiōma to be fulfilled (E5, Rom 8:4); John's "new commandment" = "from the beginning" (E19, 2 Jn 1:5-6); every content-identification = moral law/Decalogue (N5). | This is an inference because it SYSTEMATIZES multiple E/N items into a doctrinal claim. No single verse says "the law of Christ IS the moral law under new covenant administration." The individual texts each point in this direction, but the synthesis is a human systematization. | #5 (systematizing into a doctrine) |
| I3 | All "law of ___" phrases describe aspects of a single moral law under different conditions, rather than distinct bodies of legislation. | I-A | "Law of Christ" contextual content = "all the law" in love (E1→E2); "law of liberty" content = Decalogue + love command (E12→E14→E15); "law of God" content = 10th commandment (E7→Rom 7:7); "law of the Spirit of life" enables the moral law's dikaiōma (N3, E4→E5); "law of my mind" = "law of God" as known by mind (N2, E6→E7→E8). | This is an inference because no single verse states all these phrases describe the same moral law. Each identification is textual, but the synthesis across all phrases is systematization. | #5 (systematizing), #4a (SIS — contextual connections verified by shared vocabulary and same-author usage) |
| I4 | The NT teaches a "replacement law" — a qualitatively new code replacing the Ten Commandments, identified by phrases like "law of Christ," "law of liberty," and "law of the Spirit of life." | I-D | The text says "fulfil the law of Christ" (E1, Gal 6:2), "the perfect law of liberty" (E12, Jas 1:25), "the law of the Spirit of life" (E4, Rom 8:2). But: (a) No NT text lists the contents of this alleged replacement code; (b) Every content-identification points to the moral law/Decalogue (N5); (c) Paul says he is "not lawless toward God" (E3); (d) James locates the law "according to the scripture" (E14); (e) John says the command is "from the beginning" (E18, E19); (f) James says there is one lawgiver (E21). | This claim requires overriding N5 (every content-identification = moral law), E14 (OT source), E18/E19 (from the beginning), E3 (not lawless toward God), and supplying a concept (replacement code) that no text states. | #1 (adding unstated concept: replacement code), #3 (external framework), requires overriding E/N items |
| I5 | The "law of the Spirit of life" (Rom 8:2) IS the moral law itself — the same code, simply empowered by the Spirit. | I-B | The text says "the law of the Spirit of life...hath made me free from the law of sin and death" (E4, Rom 8:2). The purpose is "that the dikaiōma of the law might be fulfilled in us" (E5, Rom 8:4). But in 8:2, both "laws" are articular (ho nomos), and the "law of the Spirit" FREES from the "law of sin" — it functions as a governing power, not a code. N3 says the Spirit's law ENABLES the moral law's fulfillment — this implies the Spirit's law and the moral law are distinct (one enables, the other is enabled). | FOR the identification: the dikaiōma of "the law" (8:4) is the same law's requirement that the Spirit enables. AGAINST: in 8:2, both "laws" function as competing POWERS (one sets free, the other enslaves). If the "law of the Spirit" IS the moral law, then the moral law sets free from the moral law — which is incoherent. The "law of the Spirit" is more precisely the Spirit's governing power that enables obedience to the moral law. | #2 (choosing between readings: code vs. power) |
| I6 | Paul's three positions in 1 Cor 9:20-21 (under the law / without law / in-law to Christ) represent three successive dispensations: old covenant → lawlessness → new law of Christ. | I-D | Paul says he becomes "as a Jew" to Jews, "as without law" to Gentiles, while actually being "ennomos Christou" (E3, 1 Cor 9:20-21). But the context is Paul's MISSIONARY ADAPTATION, not a dispensational scheme. Paul adapts his approach to different audiences (v.19: "I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more"; v.22: "I am made all things to all men"). The three positions describe audiences Paul adapts to, not historical periods. | This claim requires adding a dispensational framework the text does not contain. Paul's context is evangelistic method (gaining Jews, Gentiles, the weak — vv.19-22), not historical periodization. The parenthetical limits Paul's adaptation, not his historical location. | #1 (adding dispensational concept), #3 (external framework: dispensationalism) |

### I-B Resolution: I5 — Is the "law of the Spirit of life" the moral law itself?

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR (the law of the Spirit = the moral law): E5 (dikaiōma of the law fulfilled in Spirit-walkers); E7 (delight in the law of God); E22 (what the law could not do — implying the law remains the standard)
- AGAINST (the law of the Spirit = a governing power/principle, distinct from the code): E4 (two "laws" compete — one frees, one enslaves); N3 (the Spirit's law ENABLES the moral law's fulfillment — they are functionally distinct)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E4 (Rom 8:2) | Contextually Clear | The two "laws" function as competing powers (one frees, one enslaves); both articular; context identifies them as governing dynamics |
| E5 (Rom 8:4) | Plain | "the dikaiōma of the law" directly references the moral law's righteous requirement being fulfilled |
| E7 (Rom 7:22) | Plain | Direct statement of delight in the law of God |
| E22 (Rom 8:3) | Plain | Direct statement of the law's limitation being in the flesh |
| N3 | Contextually Clear | The hina clause connects 8:2 to 8:4 grammatically, establishing the Spirit's power as the MEANS and the law's fulfillment as the PURPOSE |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
Both sides agree the moral law is the standard being fulfilled (E5). The question is whether the "law of the Spirit" IS the moral law or is the Spirit's POWER enabling the moral law. The E/N items on the "governing power" side (E4, N3) show the "law of the Spirit" as a means that produces a result (the moral law's fulfillment). The E items on the "moral law" side (E5, E7, E22) confirm the moral law as the standard but do not state the "law of the Spirit" IS the moral law.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
N3 resolves the tension: the hina clause in 8:4 establishes the purpose relationship — the Spirit's work (8:2) leads TO the moral law's fulfillment (8:4). The means (Spirit's governing power) and the goal (moral law's dikaiōma) are functionally distinct. The clearer passage (8:3-4, which explicitly names "the law" and its dikaiōma) governs the reading of 8:2.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Moderate**
The "law of the Spirit of life" is the Spirit's governing power that produces the fulfillment of the moral law's righteous requirement. It is not the moral law itself, nor is it a replacement law. It is the dynamic by which the moral law's goal is achieved. E4 and N3 support the "governing power" reading; E5 confirms the moral law remains the standard. There is no genuine conflict — the items complement each other.

## 4. Classification Decision Trees (Applied)

### Tree 1 (Tier) — Applied to all items above in their respective tables.

### Tree 2 (I-Type) — Applied:

**I1 (replacement law):**
- Source test: "replacement code" is NOT found in E/N tables. No E or N item states a replacement law exists. → External
- Direction test: requires overriding N5, E14, E18, E19. → Conflicts
- → I-D. Consistency check: overrides N5, E14, E18, E19. ✓

**I2 (law of Christ = moral law under new administration):**
- Source test: ALL components found in E/N (E1, E2, E3, E5, N5). → Text-derived
- Direction test: does NOT require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. → Aligns
- → I-A. Consistency check: requires only #5 (systematizing). ✓

**I3 (all phrases describe aspects of same moral law):**
- Source test: ALL components found in E/N. → Text-derived
- Direction test: does NOT require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. → Aligns
- → I-A. Consistency check: requires #5 (systematizing) + #4a (SIS verified connections). ✓

**I4 (NT teaches replacement law — comprehensive claim):**
- Source test: "replacement code" is NOT in E/N. → External
- Direction test: requires overriding multiple E/N items. → Conflicts
- → I-D. Consistency check: overrides N5, E14, E18, E19, E3. ✓

**I5 (law of Spirit = the moral law itself):**
- Source test: components found in E/N. → Text-derived
- Direction test: requires E4 (two competing laws) to mean the SAME law appears on both sides — i.e., the moral law frees from the moral law. This is not its lexical value. → Conflicts
- → I-B. Consistency check: E/N on both sides. ✓

**I6 (three dispensations in 1 Cor 9:20-21):**
- Source test: "dispensational periods" is NOT in E/N. → External
- Direction test: requires E3 to mean a historical progression rather than missionary adaptation. → Conflicts
- → I-D. Consistency check: overrides E3 (context = missionary method). ✓

### Tree 3 (E-Positional) — Applied above in E-item classification section.

### Tree 5 (I-Positional) — Applied:

**I1:** IP0: concerns the moral law (Decalogue replacement). → Not ceremonial. IP2: claims the moral law was replaced by a new code → **Abolished**

**I2:** IP0: concerns the moral law. IP1: claims the moral law continues under new covenant administration → **Continues**

**I3:** IP0: concerns the moral law. IP1: claims the moral law continues, described under different aspects → **Continues**

**I4:** IP0: concerns the moral law. IP2: claims a replacement code supersedes the Decalogue → **Abolished**

**I5:** IP0: concerns the moral law. IP1: claims the moral law's dikaiōma is fulfilled in Spirit-walkers → **Continues** (both readings affirm the moral law continues as the standard)

**I6:** IP0: concerns the moral law. IP2: implies the moral law was replaced by a new dispensation → **Abolished**

## 5. Verification Phase

### Step A: Verify explicit statements
- All E-items quote or closely paraphrase actual verse text. ✓
- Each E-item reflects the plain meaning of the words. ✓
- E1 reclassified from Continues to Neutral (referent ambiguous from the verse alone).

### Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items

- N3: Unavoidable from E4, E5, E22 (hina clause). ✓
- N4: Unavoidable from E3 (single parenthetical clause). ✓
- N5: Unavoidable from cited E-items — every content-identification = moral law. ✓
- N6: Unavoidable from E17-E19 (same author, same commandment, both descriptions). ✓
- N7: Unavoidable from E11 (Paul's own explanation). ✓

### Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test)

### Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test)
- I1: requires overriding N5, E14, E18, E19 → conflicts. ✓
- I2: no E/N overridden → aligns. ✓
- I3: no E/N overridden → aligns. ✓
- I4: requires overriding N5, E14, E18, E19, E3 → conflicts. ✓
- I5: requires E4 to mean something other than competing powers → conflicts. ✓
- I6: requires E3 to mean dispensational scheme → conflicts. ✓

### Step E: Consistency checks

## 8. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

### What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):

1. Paul uses nomos in two distinct senses in the "law of ___" phrases: operating principle (Rom 3:27; 7:23; 8:2) and body of moral obligation (Gal 6:2; Rom 7:22,25; 8:7).

2. The "law of my mind" (Rom 7:23) is contextually identified as the moral law as apprehended by the renewed mind — the same "law of God" Paul delights in (Rom 7:22) and serves (Rom 7:25).

3. The "law of the Spirit of life" (Rom 8:2) is the governing power that enables the fulfillment of the moral law's righteous requirement in Spirit-walkers (Rom 8:4). The hina purpose clause connects the two.

4. Paul's status as "ennomos Christou" (in-law to Christ, 1 Cor 9:21) and "not anomos theou" (not lawless toward God) coexist in a single adversative clause as concurrent realities.

5. Every NT passage that specifies content for a "law of ___" phrase identifies that content as the moral law/Decalogue and/or the love command from Lev 19:18. No passage specifies different content.

6. John's "new commandment" (Jn 13:34) is simultaneously "old" (from the beginning, 1 Jn 2:7; 2 Jn 1:5) and "new" (kainos — new in quality, not new in time).

7. Israel's failure to attain the "law of righteousness" (Rom 9:31) was due to pursuing by works rather than faith. The text itself identifies the method as the problem.

8. James identifies the content of the "law of liberty" as Decalogue commands (Jas 2:11) and the love command (Jas 2:8), sourced "according to the scripture" (Jas 2:8).

9. James identifies one lawgiver — God (Jas 4:12).

10. The Spirit's fruit does not violate the law (Gal 5:22-23), and Paul lists Decalogue violations among "works of the flesh" in the same context as "law of Christ" (Gal 5:19-21; 6:2).

### What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):

1. It CANNOT be said that the NT explicitly introduces a "replacement law" superseding the Decalogue. No NT passage states this. No NT passage lists the contents of a replacement code. The claim requires adding content the text does not provide and overriding multiple explicit statements (I1/I4, classified I-D).

2. It CANNOT be said that "the law of Christ" (Gal 6:2) has different content from the moral law. The text does not specify different content; the contextual identification (Gal 5:14) points to "all the law" fulfilled in love.

3. It CANNOT be said that any single verse states "the law of Christ IS the moral law under new covenant administration." This is a systematization of multiple texts (I2, classified I-A) — the strongest type of inference, but still an inference.

4. It CANNOT be said that 1 Cor 9:20-21 describes three dispensational periods. The context is Paul's missionary method, not a timeline.

5. It CANNOT be said that the "law of the Spirit of life" IS the moral law itself. It is the governing POWER that enables the moral law's fulfillment (I5, resolved I-B Moderate).

6. It CANNOT be said that Paul's "not under the law" (various passages) means "not under the moral law as an obligation." The phrase's meaning depends on context — the debate remains over WHICH sense of nomos Paul intends in each passage.
