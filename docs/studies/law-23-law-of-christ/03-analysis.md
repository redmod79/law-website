# 03-analysis.md — The "Law of Christ" and Related NT Law Phrases

## Study Question

What is the "law of Christ" (Gal 6:2), the "law of the Spirit of life" (Rom 8:2), and the "law of liberty" (Jas 1:25)? Are these new laws replacing the Ten Commandments, or are they the moral law under a new covenant administration? Do the NT "law of ___" phrases represent distinct codes, descriptions of how the same moral law functions under different conditions, or uses of nomos as "principle/rule"?

## Part 1: Phrase-by-Phrase Analysis

### 1.1 "Law of Christ" — Galatians 6:2

**Text:** "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ" (ton nomon tou Christou).

**Grammar:** Articular accusative (ton nomon) with possessive/source genitive (tou Christou). The article marks a specific, known law. The verb anapleroo ("fill up, fulfil") is Future Active Indicative 2P (anaplerōsete). This is the same root as pleroo used in Gal 5:14.

**Context:** The immediate context is Gal 6:1-5, which describes restoring a brother overtaken in a fault with meekness and bearing one another's burdens. The broader context extends back to Gal 5:13-14: "Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled (peplerōtai) in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."

**What the text identifies as content:** Paul does not define a new body of legislation as the "law of Christ." The text identifies the content through the contextual chain:
- Gal 5:14: "All the law" (ho pas nomos — the entire law) is fulfilled in Lev 19:18 ("love thy neighbour as thyself"). The articular "the law" refers to the Torah/moral law.
- Gal 5:19-21: "Works of the flesh" listed include violations of the Decalogue (adultery, idolatry, murders).
- Gal 5:22-23: "The fruit of the Spirit...against such there is no law" — Spirit-produced character does not violate the law.
- Gal 6:2: "Fulfil the law of Christ" — burden-bearing is how the love command is enacted, and the love command fulfills "all the law."

The contextual chain runs: all the law → fulfilled in the love command → love enacted through burden-bearing → this fulfills "the law of Christ." The text does not introduce any content for "the law of Christ" that differs from "all the law" fulfilled in love.

**Genitive analysis:** The genitive "tou Christou" could mean: (a) the law Christ gave, (b) the law Christ exemplified, (c) the law belonging to Christ's kingdom, (d) the moral law as administered under Christ. The text does not specify which sense, but the contextual identification of the content as "all the law" fulfilled in love is stated regardless of which genitive sense is chosen.

**Observation:** The text does not present "the law of Christ" as a replacement for a prior law. The phrase appears in a context where "all the law" is already affirmed as fulfilled through love (5:14), and the same letter states that "neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature" (6:15) — the contrast is with circumcision (ceremonial), not with the moral law.

### 1.2 "Ennomos Christou" — 1 Corinthians 9:21

**Text:** "To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law."

**Greek:** tois anomois hōs anomos, mē ōn anomos theou all' ennomos Christou, hina kerdanō tous anomous.

**Grammar:** The verse contains four uses of anomos/ennomos:
1. tois anomois (Dat Pl M) — "to those without law" (the Gentile audience Paul adapts to)
2. hōs anomos (Nom Sg M) — "as [one] without law" (Paul's outward adaptation)
3. mē ōn anomos theou (Nom Sg M + Gen) — "not being lawless toward God" (Paul's caveat — present participle = ongoing state)
4. ennomos Christou (Nom Sg M + Gen) — "in-law to Christ" (Paul's actual status)

**What the text states:** Paul explicitly limits his adaptation to Gentiles by a parenthetical that asserts two simultaneous conditions: (a) he is NOT anomos theou — not lawless toward God, and (b) he IS ennomos Christou — within-law of/to Christ. The compound adjective ennomos (en + nomos) means "within the sphere of law" (cf. Acts 19:39, "lawful assembly"). Paul is inside a law-framework, not outside it.

**The triple construction:** Paul identifies three positions in this verse:
- "Under the law" (hypo nomon, v.20) — the Jewish position
- "Without law" (anomos) — the Gentile position
- "In-law to Christ" (ennomos Christou) — Paul's actual position

Paul is NOT in position 1 (under the law — i.e., under the Mosaic administration) nor in position 2 (without law — lawless). He is in position 3: within a law-framework defined by his relationship to Christ. The parenthetical makes clear that position 3 is NOT lawlessness toward God.

**Relationship to Gal 6:2:** The genitive Christou appears in both passages — ton nomon tou Christou (Gal 6:2) and ennomos Christou (1 Cor 9:21). Whether these refer to the same concept depends on whether Paul uses the Christ-genitive consistently. Both describe a law-relationship mediated through Christ. The text does not define the content of ennomos Christou directly, but the caveat "not being lawless toward God" (mē ōn anomos theou) states that Paul's relationship to God's law remains intact.

**Context (1 Cor 9:8-9):** Earlier in the same chapter, Paul appeals to "the law of Moses" as authoritative: "It is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox" (9:9). Paul treats the Mosaic law as carrying ongoing authority (extracting a principle of support for gospel workers), even while distinguishing his position as "ennomos Christou" rather than "hypo nomon."

---

### 1.3 "Law of the Spirit of Life" — Romans 8:2

**Text:** "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death."

**Greek:** ho gar nomos tou Pneumatos tēs zōēs en Christō Iēsou ēleutherōsen se apo tou nomou tēs hamartias kai tou thanatou.

**Grammar:** Both uses of nomos are articular (ho nomos... tou nomou). The first has a double genitive chain: "of the Spirit of [the] life." The verb ēleutherōsen (Aorist Active Indicative 3S) means "set free" — completed action. The second nomos has twin genitives: "of sin and of death."

**What the text states:** Paul names two "laws" (operating principles/governing powers):
- "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" — a dynamic that produces life, operating through the Spirit, located "in Christ Jesus."
- "The law of sin and death" — a dynamic that produces death, operating through sin.

The first has set the believer free (ēleutherōsen) from the second.

**Is nomos here a code or a principle?** The immediately following context (8:3-4) shifts to unambiguous Torah language: "For what the law (ho nomos) could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son...condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness (to dikaiōma) of the law (tou nomou) might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Here "the law" is the moral law whose dikaiōma (righteous requirement) is fulfilled in Spirit-walkers. The "law of the Spirit of life" (8:2) describes the Spirit's governing power that produces the fulfillment of the moral law's requirement (8:4).

Paul's argument runs: the law of the Spirit of life (8:2, governing principle) → frees from sin and death → so that the dikaiōma of the law (8:4, the moral law) might be fulfilled in Spirit-walkers. The "law of the Spirit of life" is not a replacement for the moral law but the principle/power by which the moral law's requirement is fulfilled.

**Observation:** Rom 8:7 in the same context: "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God (tō nomō tou theou), neither indeed can be." The "law of God" here is the moral law (same phrase as Rom 7:22,25). The carnal mind cannot be subject to this law; the spiritual mind (empowered by the "law of the Spirit of life") can. The two nomos uses in 8:2 describe competing governing powers; the moral law itself is the standard both powers relate to — one enables obedience to it (Spirit), the other prevents it (sin).

---

### 1.4 "Law of Sin and Death" — Romans 8:2 (cf. 7:23, 25)

**Text:** "...the law of sin and death" (tou nomou tēs hamartias kai tou thanatou).

**Grammar:** Articular genitive (tou nomou) with twin genitives (tēs hamartias kai tou thanatou).

**Context connection to Rom 7:23, 25:** The phrase "law of sin" (ho nomos tēs hamartias) first appears in Rom 7:23 and 7:25. In 7:23: "I see another law (heteron nomon) in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members." In 7:25: "With the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin."

**What the text states:** The "law of sin" is:
- Located "in my members" (7:23) — i.e., in the flesh
- A different (heteron) governing power from the "law of my mind" (7:23)
- It wars against and takes captive (military metaphor, 7:23)
- The flesh serves it (7:25)
- In 8:2 it is expanded to "law of sin AND death" — sin produces death (cf. Rom 6:23, "the wages of sin is death")

This is not a code of legislation. It is the governing power/principle of sin operating in fallen human nature. The text describes it as a force that compels behavior ("bringing me into captivity," "the flesh serves it"), not a set of commands.

---

### 1.5 "Law of My Mind" — Romans 7:23

**Text:** "...warring against the law of my mind" (tō nomō tou noos mou).

**Grammar:** Articular dative (tō nomō) with possessive genitive chain (tou noos mou — "of my mind").

**Context:** The verse immediately follows Rom 7:22: "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man." The "law of my mind" parallels "the law of God" that the inward man delights in. The warfare is between the "law of my mind" (= the moral law as apprehended by the renewed mind/inward man) and the "law of sin in my members" (= the sin principle in the flesh).

**What the text states:** The "law of my mind" is:
- The object of delight "after the inward man" (7:22 establishes this as "the law of God")
- At war with the "law of sin" (7:23)
- The basis for Paul's statement: "with the mind I myself serve the law of God" (7:25)

The text equates "the law of my mind" with "the law of God" as experienced by the renewed inner person. This is not a separate code but a description of how the moral law functions in the believer — it is the law as known and affirmed by the mind, contrasted with the sin-principle experienced in the members.

---

### 1.6 "Law of Faith" vs. "Law of Works" — Romans 3:27

**Text:** "Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith."

**Greek:** dia poiou nomou? tōn ergōn? ouchi, alla dia nomou pisteōs.

**Grammar:** The interrogative poiou (qualitative: "of what sort/kind") asks about the TYPE of nomos, treating "law" as a category with species. Both nomos uses are anarthrous (no article) in the genitive — nomou. The genitive ergōn is articular (tōn ergōn — "of the works," specific category) while pisteōs is anarthrous ("of faith").

**What the text states:** Paul asks "by what kind of law" boasting is excluded. He names two kinds:
- nomos ergōn ("principle/system of works") — this does not exclude boasting
- nomos pisteōs ("principle/system of faith") — this excludes boasting

**Is nomos here a code?** The question "by what kind of law?" (dia poiou nomou) treats nomos as having sub-types distinguished by their operational character (works vs. faith). This is not "which body of legislation?" but "which operating principle/system?" This reading is supported by the immediate sequel:
- v.28: "A man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law" — the works-system does not justify
- v.31: "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law" — Paul shifts to articular ho nomos (the Torah/moral law) and affirms it is established, not voided, through faith

The shift from anarthrous "law of faith/works" (3:27, principle) to articular "the law" (3:31, code) within the same paragraph signals Paul's distinction between nomos-as-principle and nomos-as-code.

---

### 1.7 "Law of Righteousness" — Romans 9:31

**Text:** "But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness."

**Greek:** Israēl de diōkōn nomon dikaiosunēs eis nomon ouk ephthasen.

**Grammar:** Anarthrous nomos (nomon) with genitive dikaiosunēs ("of righteousness"). The verb diōkōn (Present Active Participle, "pursuing") describes ongoing pursuit. The verb ephthasen (Aorist Active Indicative, "attain/arrive at") describes failure to reach the goal.

**Context:** The contrast in 9:30-32:
- Gentiles: did NOT pursue righteousness → attained righteousness (by faith)
- Israel: DID pursue a "law of righteousness" → did NOT attain the law of righteousness
- Why? "Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law" (9:32)

Continuing in 10:2-4: Israel has "a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end (telos) of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."

**What the text states:** The "law of righteousness" is the law-standard Israel pursued as a means to achieve righteousness. The problem was NOT the law itself but the METHOD of pursuit: works instead of faith. Paul does not say the law was wrong or deficient in its content; he says Israel's approach was wrong. The law's goal (telos, 10:4) — bringing people to righteousness — is achieved through Christ for every believer.

**Is nomos here a code or a principle?** The anarthrous construction and the genitive dikaiosunēs describe the law as a standard characterized by righteousness. Given that Israel "pursued" it and the issue was method (works vs. faith), this is the Torah/moral law described by its quality — it is a righteous standard. It is not a separate body of legislation.

### 1.8 "Law of Liberty" — James 1:25; 2:12

**Text (1:25):** "But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed."

**Text (2:12):** "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty."

**Grammar (1:25):** eis nomon teleion ton tēs eleutherias — "into a law perfect, the [one] of liberty." Nomon is anarthrous (qualitative emphasis: "a perfect law"), but ton (resumptive article) identifies it as a known entity ("the [law] of liberty"). Teleion (Acc Sg M) modifies nomon: the law is "perfect/complete."

**Grammar (2:12):** dia nomou eleutherias — "through/by a law of liberty." Anarthrous genitive. Mellontes krinesthai — "being about to be judged." This law is the instrument of future judgment.

**What the text identifies as content:** James 2:8-11 immediately precedes the "law of liberty" reference in 2:12:
- 2:8: "the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (Lev 19:18)
- 2:10: "whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all"
- 2:11: "For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill" (6th and 7th Decalogue commandments, Exo 20:13-14)
- 2:12: "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty"

The text identifies the "law of liberty" as including: (a) the love command from Lev 19:18, (b) the 6th and 7th Decalogue commandments, (c) a law that functions as a unity ("guilty of all"). The source is "according to the scripture" (kata tēn graphēn, 2:8) — locating it in the OT.

*(Examined in depth in law-22-james-and-law.)*

**Connection to Psa 119:45:** "I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts." The OT precedent associates liberty with the keeping of God's precepts, not with freedom from them.

---

### 1.9 "Law of God" — Romans 7:22, 25; 8:7

**Text (7:22):** "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man."
**Text (7:25):** "With the mind I myself serve the law of God."
**Text (8:7):** "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."

**Grammar:** In 7:22 and 8:7, nomos is articular (tō nomō tou theou); in 7:25 it is anarthrous but the genitive theou identifies the referent.

**Content identification:** In Rom 7:7, Paul quotes the 10th Decalogue commandment ("Thou shalt not covet," Exo 20:17) as the content of "the law." In 7:12: "the law is holy, and the commandment holy, just, and good." In 7:14: "the law is spiritual." The "law of God" in 7:22, 25 and 8:7 is the moral law/Decalogue as identified by the quotation of the 10th commandment in v.7.

**Significance:** The "law of God" is the standard that the "law of my mind" affirms and serves (7:23, 25), that the "law of sin" opposes (7:23, 25), that the "law of the Spirit of life" enables obedience to (8:2→8:4), and that the carnal mind is hostile to (8:7). All the other "law of ___" phrases in Romans 7-8 relate back to this one as the moral standard.

---

### 1.10 "Law of Her Husband" — Romans 7:2

**Text:** "For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband."

**Grammar:** nomou tou andros — articular genitive. "The law of the husband" = the binding legal obligation to the husband.

**Significance:** This phrase uses nomos in the sense of a binding legal obligation or specific legal rule. It is included in the "law of ___" genitive pattern for completeness but is a different usage — a specific marital-law rule, not a general body of legislation or operating principle.

---

## Part 2: Categorization of All "Law of ___" Phrases

The analysis yields three categories based on how nomos functions in each phrase:

### Category A: Nomos = Operating Principle/Governing Power

These phrases use nomos to describe a dynamic or governing force, not a body of legislation:

| Phrase | Reference | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| law of faith | Rom 3:27 | Anarthrous; poiou asks "what kind"; contrasted with "law of works" as a principle by which boasting is excluded; same paragraph shifts to articular nomos for Torah (3:31) |
| law of works | Rom 3:27 | Same construction as "law of faith"; a principle/system that permits boasting |
| law of sin | Rom 7:23,25 | Located "in my members"; a force that takes captive; flesh serves it; not a code but a power |
| law of sin and death | Rom 8:2 | Expanded form of "law of sin"; a governing dynamic from which believers are freed |
| law of the Spirit of life | Rom 8:2 | The Spirit's governing power that frees from sin/death; leads to fulfillment of the law's dikaiōma (8:4) |
| law of my mind | Rom 7:23 | The moral law as apprehended by the renewed mind; parallels "I delight in the law of God" (7:22) |

### Category B: Nomos = The Moral Law Described by Its Relationship to Christ/God/Liberty

These phrases use nomos to refer to the moral law itself, described by a qualifying genitive:

| Phrase | Reference | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| law of Christ | Gal 6:2 | Articular; object of fulfillment (anaplēroō); contextually identified with "all the law" fulfilled in love (5:14); Decalogue violations listed in "works of the flesh" (5:19-21) |
| law of liberty | Jas 1:25; 2:12 | Content identified as Lev 19:18 + Decalogue commands (2:8-11); source is "the scripture" (2:8); judgment standard (2:12) |
| law of God | Rom 7:22,25; 8:7 | Content identified by quotation of 10th commandment (7:7); declared holy, just, good, spiritual (7:12,14) |
| law of righteousness | Rom 9:31 | The law-standard Israel pursued; failure was in method (works vs. faith), not in the law's content |

### Category C: Nomos = Specific Legal Obligation

| Phrase | Reference | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| law of her husband | Rom 7:2 | Specific marital law; binding obligation |

---

## Part 3: Comparative Analysis

### 3.1 The Articular/Anarthrous Pattern

| Category A (Principle) | Article? | Category B (Moral Law) | Article? |
|------------------------|----------|------------------------|----------|
| law of faith (Rom 3:27) | Anarthrous | law of Christ (Gal 6:2) | Articular |
| law of works (Rom 3:27) | Anarthrous | law of God (Rom 7:22,25) | Varies |
| law of sin (Rom 7:23,25) | Articular | law of liberty (Jas 1:25) | Anarthrous w/ resumptive art. |
| law of the Spirit of life (Rom 8:2) | Articular | law of righteousness (Rom 9:31) | Anarthrous |
| law of my mind (Rom 7:23) | Articular | | |

The article does not cleanly distinguish principle from code. The primary signal is CONTEXT — what Paul or James identifies as the content and how the phrase functions in the argument. This is consistent with N103 (law-20): "The articular/anarthrous pattern of nomos does NOT cleanly divide moral from ceremonial."

### 3.2 The Person-Genitive vs. Abstract-Genitive Pattern

When the genitive modifier is a PERSON (Christ, God, husband), nomos tends to mean a body of obligation/code:
- law of Christ (Gal 6:2) → the moral law as Christ's
- law of God (Rom 7:22,25) → the moral law as God's
- law of her husband (Rom 7:2) → marital obligation

When the genitive modifier is ABSTRACT (faith, works, sin, death, liberty, righteousness, mind, Spirit), nomos can mean either a governing principle or the moral law described by a quality:
- Principle: law of faith, law of works, law of sin, law of sin and death
- Quality/relationship: law of liberty (the moral law as producing liberty), law of righteousness (the moral law as righteous standard), law of the Spirit of life (the Spirit's governing power enabling the moral law's fulfillment), law of my mind (the moral law as known by the mind)

### 3.3 The "Law of Christ" = "Law of Liberty" = "Law of God"?

Three pieces of evidence connect these designations:

1. **Content identification:** All three identify the same content when the text specifies it:
   - "Law of Christ" (Gal 6:2): contextually = "all the law" fulfilled in love (Gal 5:14 = Lev 19:18); works of flesh include Decalogue violations (5:19-21)
   - "Law of liberty" (Jas 2:8-12): content = Lev 19:18 + Decalogue commands (6th, 7th)
   - "Law of God" (Rom 7:7-12): content = 10th commandment; law is holy, just, good, spiritual

2. **The love-fulfillment connection:** All three are connected to the love command:
   - Gal 6:2 (law of Christ) → Gal 5:14 ("all the law fulfilled in...love thy neighbour")
   - Jas 2:8 (royal law = law of liberty) → "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself"
   - Rom 13:8-10 (same author as "law of God") → Love fulfills specific Decalogue commands

3. **The Spirit-liberty connection:**
   - "Law of the Spirit of life" (Rom 8:2) enables fulfillment of the moral law's dikaiōma (Rom 8:4)
   - "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (2 Cor 3:17)
   - "Law of liberty" (Jas 1:25; 2:12) — the law as experienced in freedom
   - "Ye have been called unto liberty...by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in...love" (Gal 5:13-14) → the same sequence: liberty → love → law-fulfillment → "law of Christ" (6:2)

### 3.4 The Ennomos Christou / Ton Nomon tou Christou Relationship

Paul uses two different constructions to describe his relationship to Christ's law:
- 1 Cor 9:21: ennomos Christou (compound adjective + genitive) — "within-law to Christ"
- Gal 6:2: ton nomon tou Christou (noun + genitive) — "the law of Christ"

In 1 Cor 9:21, Paul's parenthetical states he is "not anomos theou" (not lawless toward God) while being "ennomos Christou" (within-law to Christ). The two are not in opposition — Paul's ennomos-to-Christ status does not make him anomos-toward-God. This text states that being "in-law to Christ" is compatible with — and expressed through — not being lawless toward God.

### 3.5 The "New Commandment" Question

**John 13:34:** "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another."

The text states Jesus gives "a new (kainēn) commandment." The word kainos (G2537) denotes new in quality/character, not new in time (that would be neos, G3501).

**1 John 2:7-8:** "Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning...Again, a new commandment I write unto you."

**2 John 1:5-6:** "And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. And this is love, that we walk after his commandments."

John explicitly states the love commandment is both old ("from the beginning") and new. The newness is in quality (kainos), not in replacement of prior content. 2 John 1:6 connects "love one another" to walking "after his commandments" — the love command does not replace the commandments but is enacted through them.

---

## Part 4: The "Replacement Law" Question

The central question is whether the NT introduces a new body of legislation ("law of Christ") that supersedes the Ten Commandments.

### Evidence examined FOR a replacement law:

1. **Gal 6:2 introduces "the law of Christ."** The text does introduce this phrase. The question is whether the content differs from the moral law.

2. **1 Cor 9:21 distinguishes "ennomos Christou" from being "under the law."** Paul does distinguish his position from being "hypo nomon" (under the law). The question is whether "not under the law" means "the moral law is abolished" or "not under the Mosaic administration as a justificatory system."

3. **Jn 13:34 uses "a new commandment."** The word kainos is used. The question is whether "new" means "replacing the old" or "new in exemplification."

### Evidence examined AGAINST a replacement law:

1. **Gal 6:2 in context identifies the content of "law of Christ" as "all the law" fulfilled in love (Gal 5:14).** The text does not introduce different content.

2. **1 Cor 9:21: Paul explicitly states he is NOT anomos theou (not lawless toward God) while being ennomos Christou.** His Christ-law relationship does not negate his God-law relationship.

3. **1 Jn 2:7; 2 Jn 1:5-6:** John explicitly states the "new commandment" is "that which we had from the beginning" and connects love to walking "after his commandments."

4. **James identifies the "law of liberty" content as Decalogue commands and Lev 19:18, sourced "according to the scripture" (2:8).** The law of liberty is the OT moral law.

5. **No NT passage lists the contents of a "replacement law."** If the "law of Christ" were a new body of legislation replacing the Decalogue, the NT would need to specify its contents. The only content identified by any NT author for any "law of ___" phrase is the moral law/Decalogue and the love command (which is itself from Lev 19:18).

6. **James 4:12: "There is one lawgiver."** If a replacement law existed, there would need to be a new lawgiver or at least a new legislative act. James identifies one lawgiver — God.

7. **1 Jn 3:4: "Sin is the transgression of the law" (hamartia estin hē anomia).** If the Decalogue were replaced, sin would need to be redefined by the replacement code. John defines sin as anomia (lawlessness) presupposing a continuing nomos.

---

## Part 5: Summary of Findings

### What the texts state:

1. Paul uses nomos in at least two distinct senses in the "law of ___" phrases: as an operating principle/governing power (law of faith, law of works, law of sin, law of sin and death, law of the Spirit of life) and as a body of moral obligation (law of Christ, law of God).

2. The "law of my mind" is the moral law as apprehended by the renewed mind (contextually equated with "the law of God" in Rom 7:22-25).

3. The "law of the Spirit of life" is the Spirit's governing power that enables the fulfillment of "the righteousness of the law" (Rom 8:2→8:4).

4. The "law of Christ" (Gal 6:2) is contextually identified with "all the law" fulfilled in love (Gal 5:14). No separate content is specified.

5. "Ennomos Christou" (1 Cor 9:21) describes Paul as within a law-framework to Christ, while simultaneously NOT being lawless toward God.

6. The "law of liberty" (Jas 1:25; 2:12) content is identified as Decalogue commands (2:11) and Lev 19:18 (2:8), sourced "according to the scripture" (2:8).

7. The "law of righteousness" (Rom 9:31) is the law-standard Israel pursued; the failure was in method (works vs. faith), not in the law's content.

8. The "new commandment" (Jn 13:34) is kainos (new in quality) and is explicitly stated to be "from the beginning" (1 Jn 2:7; 2 Jn 1:5).

9. No NT passage specifies content for any "law of ___" phrase that differs from the moral law/Decalogue and the love command from Lev 19:18.

10. No NT passage explicitly states that a "law of Christ" replaces the Ten Commandments.
