# What Specific Law Is "My Law" Written on Hearts in Jeremiah 31:33 / Hebrews 8:10 / 10:16?

## Question
What specific law is "my law" written on hearts in Jeremiah 31:33 / Hebrews 8:10 / 10:16?

## Summary Answer
The textual evidence identifies the law written on hearts in the new covenant as the moral law (Decalogue) -- the same law previously written on stone tablets. Four convergent textual markers support this identification: (1) the berith-Decalogue equation (Deu 4:13 identifies "his covenant" as "ten commandments"; Jer 31:33 writes "my law" on hearts in a "new covenant"); (2) the kathab/grapho verb connection (the same verb "write" is used for God writing the Decalogue on stone in Deu 10:4 and for God writing His law on hearts in Jer 31:33); (3) the stone-to-heart medium contrast in 2 Cor 3:3 (Paul identifies what was on stone as the content transferred to hearts); (4) the dual operation in Hebrews 10 (the same passage removes the sacrificial system in vv.1-9 and affirms law written on hearts in vv.15-17). Every new covenant passage uses possessive pronouns ("MY law," "MY laws," "MY statutes/judgments") identifying the law as God's pre-existing moral law, not a new or different law.

## Key Verses

**Jeremiah 31:33** -- "But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people."

**Deuteronomy 4:13** -- "And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone."

**Hebrews 8:10** -- "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people."

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Position | Tree 3 Trace | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts." The verb katab (H3789, "write") in Jer 31:33 is the same verb used for writing the Decalogue on stone in Deu 10:4. | Jer 31:33; Deu 10:4 | Continues | V1: YES -- "write [my law] in their hearts" is law-continuation vocabulary (written on hearts = continuation). Candidate CONTINUES. Gate 1: PASS -- "my law" (torati) identified by possessive pronoun as God's pre-existing law; the same kathab verb links to Deu 10:4 (Decalogue on stone). Gate 2: PASS -- the verb kathab and the possessive suffix are grammatical facts. Gate 3: PASS -- prophetic direct speech ("Thus saith the LORD"). Gate 4: PASS -- consistent with E038, E039. -> CONTINUES. | E303 |
| E2 | "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts." The LXX grapho ("write") in Heb 8:10/10:16 renders the Hebrew kathab of Jer 31:33 / Deu 10:4 (Decalogue-writing). | Heb 8:10; 10:16; Jer 31:33; Deu 10:4 | Continues | V1: YES -- "write [my laws] in their hearts" = law-continuation vocabulary. Candidate CONTINUES. Gate 1: PASS -- "my laws" (nomous mou) identified by possessive. Gate 2: PASS -- grapho/epigrapso is a grammatical fact. Gate 3: PASS -- didactic epistle quoting OT prophecy. Gate 4: PASS -- consistent with E038, E039. -> CONTINUES. | E304 |
| E3 | "Not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart." Paul uses the same stone-medium descriptor as the Decalogue (Exo 31:18; Deu 10:1). Stone tablets = Decalogue tablets. | 2 Cor 3:3 | Continues | V1: No explicit continuation/cessation vocabulary on its own. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral per vocabulary scan. However: the verse explicitly references "tables of stone" (the Decalogue medium -- Exo 31:18; Deu 10:1) and contrasts it with "fleshy tables of the heart." This identifies what was previously on stone as the content now written on hearts. The stone-medium identification is a distinction between categories (Decalogue on stone vs. other law in a book), supporting the Continues position's claim that the Bible distinguishes between categories of law. -> CONTINUES. | E305 |
| E4 | "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them." The immediate context (Heb 10:1-9) has just removed the sacrificial system; the law written on hearts (v.16) is distinct from what was removed. | Heb 10:16 | Continues | V1: YES -- "put my laws into their hearts" = law-continuation vocabulary. Candidate CONTINUES. Gate 1: PASS -- "my laws" (nomous mou) identified by possessive; context (vv.1-9) has removed sacrifices, so the law written on hearts is NOT the sacrificial system. Gate 2: PASS. Gate 3: PASS -- didactic epistle. Gate 4: PASS. -> CONTINUES. | E306 |
| E5 | "For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins...He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second." Hebrews 10:1-9 removes the sacrificial system. Hebrews 10:16 then quotes "my laws on their hearts." The same chapter removes ceremonial and affirms moral law written on hearts. | Heb 10:4, 9, 16 | Continues | V1: YES -- the passage structure distinguishes ceremonial (removed) from moral (written on hearts), supporting the Continues position's claim that the Bible distinguishes between categories of law. Candidate CONTINUES. Gate 1: PASS -- the referents are identified by context: "sacrifice and offering" (vv.5-8) are removed; "my laws" (v.16) are written on hearts. Gate 2: PASS. Gate 3: PASS -- didactic epistle. Gate 4: PASS -- consistent with E133, E134. -> CONTINUES. | E307 |
| E6 | "O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always." Deu 5:29 laments Israel's lack of heart-capacity for commandment-keeping; Jer 31:33 promises to resolve exactly this by writing the same commandments on hearts. | Deu 5:29; Jer 31:33 | Continues | V1: YES -- "keep all my commandments always" = commandment-keeping vocabulary. Candidate CONTINUES. Gate 1: PASS -- "all my commandments" (kol-mitsvotay) in context of the Decalogue delivery (Deu 5:6-21 = the Ten Commandments). God's lament that they lack the heart to keep these same commandments anticipates the new covenant solution. Gate 2: PASS. Gate 3: PASS -- narrative/didactic (Moses' account of God's words). Gate 4: PASS -- consistent with E265. -> CONTINUES. | E308 |

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable | Position | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The Hebrew verb katab ("write") in Jer 31:33 is the same verb used for writing the Decalogue on stone in Deu 10:4; the LXX renders both with grapho. The heart-writing and stone-writing share the same verb, linking the new covenant inscription to the Decalogue inscription. | E303; Jer 31:33; Deu 10:4 | This is an observable lexical fact. Both Hebrew texts use the same verb (kathab). Both LXX renderings use the same verb (grapho). Any reader can verify this lexical connection. | Continues | N056 |
| N2 | The stone-medium identified in 2 Cor 3:3 ("not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart") uses the same stone-tablet medium as the Decalogue (Exo 31:18; Deu 10:1). When Paul contrasts stone tables with heart tables, the stone referent is specifically the Decalogue. | E305, E003 | The only law written on stone tablets was the Decalogue (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10; 10:1-4). Other legislation was written in a book (Deu 31:24-26). When Paul references "tables of stone," the referent is necessarily the Decalogue, because no other law was written on stone. Both sides must acknowledge this historical fact. | Continues | N057 |
| N3 | Hebrews 10:1-18 removes the sacrificial system (vv.1-9, 18: "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second"; "where remission...no more offering for sin") AND quotes the new covenant law written on hearts (v.16). The same passage cannot simultaneously remove and promise to write the moral law on hearts. The ceremonial system is removed while the moral law is written on hearts. | E306, E307, E133, E134 | The passage explicitly removes "sacrifice and offering" (vv.5-8), states "no more offering for sin" (v.18), and in the same argument quotes "I will put my laws into their hearts" (v.16). If the law written on hearts were also what was removed, the passage would be internally contradictory. Both sides must acknowledge the passage contains both removal and affirmation. The only resolution is that two different categories of law are in view. | Continues | N058 |
| N4 | Deuteronomy 5:29 laments Israel's lack of heart-capacity to keep "all my commandments" -- the exact lament that Jeremiah 31:33's new covenant promise resolves ("I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts"). The two texts are connected by (a) the same vocabulary of commandment-keeping, (b) the heart as the instrument, and (c) the before/after relationship between lament and resolution. | E308, E038 | Deu 5:29 states: "O that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always." Jer 31:33 states: "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts." The lament concerns heart-capacity for keeping "all my commandments" (in the context of the Decalogue delivery, Deu 5:6-21). The promise provides exactly what the lament requests: the law written on the heart. The connection is textual -- same vocabulary, same organ (heart), lament-resolution pattern. | Continues | N059 |
| N5 | The possessive pronoun "my" in the new covenant promise -- "my law" (torati, Jer 31:33) / "my laws" (nomous mou, Heb 8:10; 10:16) -- identifies the law as God's pre-existing law. The pronoun is a lexical fact in both Hebrew and Greek. | E038, E039 | The Hebrew torati = torah + 1st-person suffix. The Greek nomous mou = nomos + genitive pronoun "my." These are grammatical facts: the law belongs to God and pre-exists the new covenant promise. A reader from any theological tradition must acknowledge the possessive identifies pre-existing law. | Continues | N051 |
| N6 | The five textually specified differences between old and new covenants are all structural/administrative: (1) location (stone -> heart), (2) power (human promise -> God's action + Spirit), (3) mediator (Moses -> Christ), (4) blood (animal -> Christ's), (5) forgiveness. No new covenant text introduces a different set of moral commands. | E038, E039, E040, E282, E274, E265 | Each difference is stated in the text: location (Jer 31:33; 2 Cor 3:3), power (Eze 36:27), mediator (Heb 8:6), blood (Heb 13:20), forgiveness (Jer 31:34; Heb 10:17). These five items are individually explicit. Together they yield a necessary implication: the covenant changes are structural, not content-based. No new covenant passage identifies a new or different moral law. | Continues | N052 |
| N7 | The NT cessation vocabulary (dogma, cheirographon, dikaiomata sarkos) is never used for the moral law/Decalogue. Dogma (G1378) appears 5 times in the NT and never refers to the Decalogue. Cheirographon (G5498) means "hand-written" -- the Decalogue was written by God's finger. | E054, E053; cf. E003 | This is a verifiable vocabulary distribution fact. Dogma occurs at Luk 2:1; Acts 16:4; 17:7; Eph 2:15; Col 2:14. In none of these does it refer to the Decalogue. The word cheirographon means "written by hand" -- the Decalogue was written by "the finger of God" (Exo 31:18). Both sides can verify this vocabulary data. | Continues | N018 |
| N8 | In 2 Cor 3:7, what is "done away" (katargoumenen) is grammatically the GLORY (doxan, feminine), not the law (nomos, masculine), because the participle is feminine singular agreeing with doxan. | E048 (2 Cor 3:7) | This is a grammatical fact. The participle katargoumenen is feminine, agreeing with doxan (feminine), not nomos (masculine). Any Greek reader can verify this agreement. | Neutral | N041 |
| N9 | Hebrews 10:1-16 both removes the sacrificial system (vv.1-9) and affirms that God will write "my laws" on hearts (v.16, quoting Jer 31:33). The same passage describes ceremonial removal and moral law continuation. | E056, E133, E039 | These are two observations from the same passage. Both sides must acknowledge that Heb 10 contains both elements. | Continues | N044 |

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria | Position | Master ID |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that "my law" (torati) in Jeremiah 31:33 refers specifically to the moral law (Decalogue), based on four convergent textual markers: (a) the berith = Decalogue equation of Deu 4:13 + the new berith writes torati on hearts (Jer 31:33); (b) the katab verb connection between Deu 10:4 (Decalogue-writing) and Jer 31:33 (heart-writing); (c) the stone medium in 2 Cor 3:3 identifying Decalogue content; (d) Heb 10 removing the ceremonial while moral laws remain on hearts. | I-A | E005/Deu 4:13 ("his covenant, even ten commandments"); E303/Jer 31:33 + Deu 10:4 (same kathab verb for both writings); E305/2 Cor 3:3 ("not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart"); N058/Heb 10:1-18 (ceremonial removed, law on hearts affirmed); N056 (kathab verb connection is a lexical fact); N057 (stone medium = Decalogue medium). | Each individual marker is explicit or a necessary implication. Combining all four into a comprehensive identification of "my law" = Decalogue requires systematization (criterion #5). All components are text-derived. No concept beyond the text is introduced. | #5 (systematizing) | Continues | I069 |
| I2 | The Bible teaches that "my law" (torati) in Jeremiah 31:33 refers to the broader Mosaic legal complex, not specifically the Decalogue, given that torati has a wide semantic range (Eze 22:26 shows it includes ceremonial elements). | I-B | FOR: Torah (H8451) can refer to the Pentateuch as a whole (e.g., "book of the law" = Pentateuch); Eze 22:26 uses "my law" (torati) in a context that includes priestly regulations about clean/unclean -- suggesting a broader referent. AGAINST: N057 (the stone medium in 2 Cor 3:3 identifies the content as the Decalogue, since only the Decalogue was written on stone); N058 (Heb 10 removes the ceremonial while affirming moral law on hearts -- the heart-law cannot be the ceremonial system); E005 (Deu 4:13 berith = Decalogue). | Torah has a semantic range that includes broader referents. Choosing the broader referent over the specific Decalogue identification requires a reading decision in the face of textual markers pointing to the Decalogue. | #2 (choosing between two possible readings) | Both (resolved Moderate toward Decalogue identification) | I070 |
| I3 | The Bible teaches that the Spirit-caused obedience to "my statutes and judgments" (Eze 36:27) refers to moral commandments (not the ceremonial system), because Ezekiel's own usage defines keeping statutes/judgments as moral content (Eze 18:5-9: no idolatry, no adultery, honesty), and the Spirit cannot cause obedience to a ceremonial system that the Spirit's own coming renders obsolete (Heb 10:9). | I-A | E040/Eze 36:27 ("I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes"); N058/Heb 10:1-18 (ceremonial removed while moral law on hearts); E056/Heb 10:1 (sacrificial system = shadow). Ezekiel's own definition of "walking in statutes" (Eze 18:5-9) includes: not worshipping idols, not defiling neighbor's wife, not oppressing, restoring pledges, feed the hungry, cover the naked. These are moral, not ceremonial. | All components are text-derived. Systematizing them into the claim that Eze 36:27's statutes are moral requires combining multiple texts. Only criterion #5. | #5 (systematizing) | Continues | I071 |
| I4 | The Spirit-caused obedience to "my statutes and judgments" (Eze 36:27) encompasses a broader moral orientation beyond the narrowly-defined Decalogue, since chuqqotai/mishpatay vocabulary extends to statutes and judgments beyond the "ten commandments" specifically. | I-B | FOR: Deu 4:13-14 distinguishes "his covenant, even ten commandments" (v.13) from "statutes and judgments" (v.14). The Eze 36:27 vocabulary is from v.14's category, not v.13's category. AGAINST: Eze 18:5-9 defines the moral content in terms consistent with Decalogue principles (no idolatry, no adultery, honesty). The broader vocabulary describes the moral content of the Decalogue as applied to specific situations, not a categorically different law. | The claim that chuqqot/mishpatim = something other than the Decalogue requires a reading decision about whether these terms overlap with or supplement the Decalogue. | #2 (choosing between two possible readings) | Both (resolved Moderate toward moral content, possibly broader than the ten specifically but moral in nature -- not ceremonial) | I072 |
| I5 | The Bible teaches that all specific law-content is abolished by the new covenant and no binding moral obligation carries forward. | I-D | This claim requires overriding: the possessive pronouns in Jer 31:33 ("MY law"), Heb 8:10 ("MY laws"), Heb 10:16 ("MY laws"), Eze 36:27 ("MY statutes...MY judgments") -- all identifying God's pre-existing law as the content written on hearts (E038, E039, E040); Paul's "we establish the law" through faith (E025/Rom 3:31); the law's righteous requirement being fulfilled in Spirit-walkers (E026/Rom 8:4). No new covenant text states "all law is abolished." | This requires overriding explicit possessive pronouns and positive statements about the law. No verse states all law-content is abolished. The concept "all law abolished" must be added by the interpreter. | #1 (adding a concept the text doesn't state) | Abolished | I073 |

### I-B Resolution: I070 -- "My law" (torati) = broader Mosaic complex vs. Decalogue specifically

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR broader referent: Torah (H8451) has a wide semantic range; Eze 22:26 uses torati for priestly regulations; Jeremiah himself never explicitly restricts torati to the Decalogue alone.
- AGAINST broader referent (FOR Decalogue identification): N057 (stone = Decalogue); N058 (Heb 10 removes ceremonial, affirms moral on hearts); E005 (Deu 4:13: berith = ten commandments); N056 (kathab verb connection between Deu 10:4 and Jer 31:33).

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| N057 | Plain | The Decalogue is the only law written on stone; when 2 Cor 3:3 references stone tables, the referent is the Decalogue. This is a historical fact. |
| N058 | Plain | Heb 10 removes sacrifices (vv.1-9) and writes law on hearts (v.16) in the same passage. Both elements are explicit. |
| E005 | Plain | "His covenant, even ten commandments" is a direct equation stated by Moses. |
| N056 | Contextually Clear | The kathab verb connection is a lexical fact (same verb), but applying it to identify content requires minimal interpretation. |
| Torah semantic range | Contextually Clear | Torah's broad range is a lexical fact, but applying the broader range to Jer 31:33 requires choosing against the contextual markers. |
| Eze 22:26 | Ambiguous | This passage uses torati in a context including priestly regulations, but it also includes moral violations in the same verse ("have profaned mine holy things...have put no difference between the holy and profane"). The moral/ceremonial mix makes the referent ambiguous. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
Three Plain statements (N057, N058, E005) support the Decalogue identification. One Contextually Clear item (N056) supports the same direction. On the other side, one Contextually Clear item (semantic range) and one Ambiguous item (Eze 22:26) support the broader reading.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements determine the reading of the Ambiguous ones. N057 (stone = Decalogue), N058 (ceremonial removed / moral remains), and E005 (covenant = ten commandments) are plain and govern the interpretation of the broader semantic range of torah in this context. Torah CAN mean the broader Pentateuch, but the contextual markers in the new covenant passages identify the Decalogue as the specific referent.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate toward Decalogue identification.**
Three Plain items support the Decalogue as the primary referent of "my law" in Jer 31:33. The broader semantic range of torah is acknowledged (Contextually Clear) but does not override the converging textual markers. The resolution is "Moderate" rather than "Strong" because torah's semantic range permits a broader reading, even though the contextual evidence points to the Decalogue.

---

### I-B Resolution: I072 -- Spirit-caused obedience broader than Decalogue

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR broader scope: Deu 4:13-14 distinguishes "ten commandments" (v.13) from "statutes and judgments" (v.14); Eze 36:27 uses "statutes/judgments" vocabulary, not "ten commandments" vocabulary.
- AGAINST broader scope (FOR moral-content identification): Eze 18:5-9 defines "walking in my statutes" in moral terms (no idolatry, no adultery, honesty, mercy); N058 (ceremonial removed/moral remains in Heb 10); the Spirit cannot cause obedience to an abolished ceremonial system.

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Deu 4:13-14 distinction | Plain | Moses' distinction between covenant (Decalogue) and statutes/judgments is explicit. |
| Eze 18:5-9 moral definition | Contextually Clear | Ezekiel defines the content in moral terms, but the reader must apply this definition to Eze 36:27. |
| N058 | Plain | Heb 10 removes ceremonial, affirms moral. |
| Vocabulary difference | Contextually Clear | The vocabulary (chuqqot/mishpatim) is demonstrably broader than "ten commandments." |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
Both sides have Contextually Clear evidence. The moral content identification is supported by Eze 18:5-9's own definition and N058's Heb 10 structural evidence. The vocabulary breadth is acknowledged.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
N058 (ceremonial removed, moral remains) governs: the statutes/judgments cannot be ceremonial, since the Spirit's coming obsoletes the ceremonial system. Eze 18:5-9 defines the content as moral.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate toward moral content identification.**
The evidence indicates the statutes/judgments are moral in nature. The vocabulary may be broader than the "ten commandments" narrowly defined but describes moral principles consistent with and including the Decalogue's content. The resolution acknowledges that Ezekiel's vocabulary encompasses the moral law and its applications without being restricted to the ten specific commandments alone.

### 4. Verification Phase

**Step A -- Verify explicit statements:**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases verse text. Checked: E1-E24 all meet this criterion.
- No E-item states a positional inference rather than a textual fact.

**Step A2 -- Verify positional classifications of E-items:**
- E1-E6 (new items E303-E308): Each processed through Tree 3 with full gate checks documented above.
- E7-E24 (existing master items): Already verified in prior studies.

**Step B -- Verify necessary implications:**
- N1 (N056): kathab verb connection is a verifiable lexical fact. Both sides acknowledge same verb. PASS.
- N2 (N057): Only the Decalogue was written on stone. This is a historical fact. PASS.
- N3 (N058): Heb 10 contains both removal (vv.1-9) and affirmation (v.16). Cannot simultaneously remove and write the same law. PASS.
- N4 (N059): Deu 5:29 lament + Jer 31:33 promise share heart/commandment vocabulary. PASS.
- N5 (N051): Possessive pronoun is a grammatical fact. PASS.
- N6 (N052): Five differences are individually explicit; none introduces new moral content. PASS.
- N7 (N018): Vocabulary distribution is verifiable. PASS.
- N8 (N041): Grammar agreement is verifiable. PASS.
- N9 (N044): Both elements are in the same passage. PASS.

**Step C -- Verify inference source tests:**
- I1 (I069): All components (E005, E303, E305, N056, N057, N058) are in E/N tables. Text-derived. -> I-A. Correct.
- I2 (I070): Has E/N items on both sides. -> I-B. Correct.

- I4 (I072): Has E/N items on both sides. -> I-B. Correct.
- I5 (I073): Requires adding "all law abolished" -- external to text. Overrides E038, E039, E040, E025, E026. -> I-D. Correct.

**Step D -- Verify inference direction tests:**
- I1 (I069): Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. -> Aligns (I-A). Correct.
- I2 (I070): Requires choosing between semantic-range readings. -> Conflicts (I-B). Correct.
- I3 (I071): Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. -> Aligns (I-A). Correct.
- I4 (I072): Requires choosing between vocabulary-scope readings. -> Conflicts (I-B). Correct.
- I5 (I073): Requires overriding possessive pronouns and establishment language. -> Conflicts (I-D). Correct.

**Step E -- Consistency checks:**
- I-A items (I069, I071): Both require only criterion #5. Correct.
- I-B items (I070, I072): Both have E/N items on both sides. Correct.
- I-D item (I073): Overrides E038, E039, E040, E025, E026. Correct.

**Step F -- Verify SIS connections:**
- N056 connection (kathab verb): Shared vocabulary in Jer 31:33 and Deu 10:4. Verified.
- N057 connection (stone tables): Historical fact that only Decalogue was on stone. Verified.
- N058 connection (Heb 10 structure): Same passage. Verified.

### 7. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

**What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):**

- God promises in the new covenant to write "MY law" (torati / nomous mou) on hearts (Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10; 10:16). The possessive pronoun identifies the law as God's pre-existing law.
- The old covenant's terms were the Ten Commandments ("his covenant, even ten commandments" -- Deu 4:13).
- The new covenant writes the law on hearts rather than stone. The same verb kathab/grapho is used for both the stone-writing (Deu 10:4) and the heart-writing (Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10).
- The stone medium in 2 Cor 3:3 identifies the Decalogue specifically, since no other law was written on stone tablets.
- Hebrews 10:1-18 removes the sacrificial system (vv.1-9, 18) and affirms law written on hearts (v.16) within the same sustained argument. The passage distinguishes between what is removed (sacrifices) and what is written on hearts (God's laws).
- The fault in the old covenant was with the people (Heb 8:8, autous = the people), not with the law.
- The Spirit enables obedience to God's statutes and judgments (Eze 36:27), which Ezekiel defines in moral terms (Eze 18:5-9).
- The law's righteous requirement (dikaioma, singular -- Rom 8:4) is fulfilled in Spirit-led believers.
- The NT cessation vocabulary (dogma, cheirographon, dikaiomata sarkos) is never applied to the Decalogue.
- No new covenant text introduces a new or different set of moral commands to replace the Decalogue.
- The five textually specified differences between old and new covenants are all structural/administrative (location, power, mediator, blood, forgiveness), not changes in the moral law content.

**What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):**

- It cannot be said that any verse explicitly states "the Ten Commandments are the law written on hearts." The identification requires combining textual markers (berith = Decalogue; kathab verb; stone medium; Heb 10 structure). The convergence is strong, but no single verse states the equation in those terms.
- It cannot be said that "my law" (torati) in Jer 31:33 is restricted to ONLY the ten specific commandments and nothing else. Torah has a semantic range that can include broader moral instruction. The textual markers identify the Decalogue as the primary referent, but the broader moral principles encoded in and derived from the Decalogue may also be included.
- It cannot be said that Eze 36:27's "my statutes and my judgments" are identical to the Ten Commandments in the narrow sense. The vocabulary (chuqqot/mishpatim) is broader. What CAN be said is that Ezekiel defines this content in moral terms (Eze 18:5-9), and the ceremonial system cannot be in view because the Spirit's own coming renders it obsolete.
- It cannot be said that any new covenant text states "all law is abolished." The Abolished claim that no binding moral obligation carries forward requires overriding the possessive pronouns, the establishment language (Rom 3:31), and the Spirit-fulfillment language (Rom 8:4) -- making it an I-D inference that overrides explicit and necessary-implication evidence.

## Analysis

### Angle 1: Jeremiah's Use of Torati

Jeremiah uses torati (God speaking: "my law") six times (Jer 6:19; 9:12; 16:11; 26:4; 31:33; 44:10). In every instance, the possessive "my" refers to God's pre-existing law that the people violated or are called to obey. In Jer 31:33, God promises to write this same "my law" on hearts. The possessive pronoun is a lexical fact: God does not say "a new law" or "a different law" but "MY law" -- the law He already possesses and has given.

### Angle 2: The Deu 4:13 Interpretive Key

Deuteronomy 4:13 explicitly identifies "his covenant" as "ten commandments" written on "two tables of stone." The immediately following verse (4:14) separately identifies "statutes and judgments" taught through Moses. When Jeremiah 31:31 speaks of a "new covenant" (berith chadashah) in which "my law" is written on hearts (v.33), the interpretive connection is: the old berith's terms were the Decalogue (Deu 4:13); the new berith writes the same law on a new medium (hearts instead of stone). The terms are the constant; the administration changes.

### Angle 3: The Hebrews 10:1-16 Structure

Hebrews 10:1-9 removes "sacrifice and offering" (quoting Psa 40:6-8): "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second" (v.9). Then vv.15-17 affirm: "I will put my laws into their hearts." The author identifies what is taken away (the sacrificial system) and what is established (the new covenant with law on hearts) in the same passage. This structural distinction between what is removed and what is affirmed is a textual fact. The passage itself distinguishes ceremonial from moral law.

### Angle 4: Ezekiel 36:27 -- Statutes and Judgments

Ezekiel 36:27 promises Spirit-caused obedience to "my statutes" (chuqqot) and "my judgments" (mishpatim). These terms are broader than the "ten commandments" of Deu 4:13. Ezekiel 18:5-9 defines what it means to "walk in my statutes" and "keep my judgments" in moral terms: no idolatry, no adultery, no oppression, honest dealing, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked. The content is moral. The Spirit cannot cause obedience to a ceremonial system that the Spirit's own coming renders obsolete. The broader vocabulary describes the moral law and its applications -- including but not limited to the Decalogue's specific ten commandments.

### Angle 5: 2 Corinthians 3:3 -- Stone-to-Heart

Paul's contrast between "tables of stone" and "fleshy tables of the heart" identifies the content: only the Decalogue was written on stone tablets. No other law was engraved on stone. When Paul says the content moves from stone to heart, the Decalogue is the necessary referent. The medium changes from stone to heart; the content remains the same.

### Angle 6: Romans 8:3-4 -- The Righteousness of the Law

Paul states that "the righteousness (to dikaioma, singular) of the law" is "fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." The singular dikaioma denotes a unified righteous requirement -- the moral standard of the law. This is distinguished from the plural dikaiomata (multiple ceremonial regulations) used in Heb 9:1, 10. The Spirit fulfills the law's one moral standard in believers -- the NT expression of the same reality promised in Eze 36:27 (Spirit-caused obedience) and Jer 31:33 (law written on hearts).

### The Counter-Arguments

The passages cited as evidence that the law written on hearts is something other than the Decalogue (Gal 3:19-25; 2 Cor 3:7-11; Heb 8:13; Col 2:14-17; Eph 2:15) have been examined in prior studies (law-08, law-09, law-10). In each case: (a) the referent of what is abolished is identified by the text's own vocabulary as ceremonial (dogma, dikaiomata sarkos, cheirographon, shadow vocabulary); (b) no abolition passage names the Decalogue as its referent; (c) the Continues-position E/N items are not overridden by these passages. The claim that all law is abolished requires an I-D inference that overrides explicit statements and necessary implications.

## Word Studies

**Torah (H8451):** In Jer 31:33, torah with the possessive "my" refers to God's pre-existing law. Jeremiah's consistent usage confirms this: every instance of torati in Jeremiah refers to law the people already had and violated.

**Kathab (H3789):** The same verb connects God's writing of the Decalogue on stone (8 passages) with God's writing of His law on hearts (Jer 31:33). The divine Author, the writing action, and the law content are constants; the surface changes.

**Dikaioma (G1345):** The singular in Rom 8:4 denotes the law's unified moral standard; the plural in Heb 9:1, 10 denotes multiple ceremonial regulations. This distinction supports identifying the "righteousness of the law" as the moral law's single righteous requirement.

**Dogma (G1378):** Never used for the Decalogue in any of its 5 NT occurrences. The two abolition passages (Col 2:14; Eph 2:15) use dogma for what was removed, specifying the referent as ceremonial ordinances.

---

## Conclusion

The textual evidence identifies the law written on hearts in the new covenant as the moral law -- primarily the Decalogue, with its moral principles as expounded throughout Scripture. Four convergent textual markers support this identification: (1) the berith = Decalogue equation (Deu 4:13); (2) the kathab verb connection between stone-writing and heart-writing; (3) the stone-to-heart medium contrast in 2 Cor 3:3; (4) the Hebrews 10 structure removing the ceremonial while affirming law on hearts.

This study produced 6 new E-items (all Continues: E303-E308), 4 new N-items (all Continues: N056-N059), and 5 new I-items (2 I-A Continues, 2 I-B resolved Moderate toward Continues, 1 I-D Abolished). No new Abolished E or N items were found. The single Abolished claim (I073: all law abolished by new covenant) is classified I-D because it requires overriding the possessive pronouns in the new covenant passages, Paul's "we establish the law" (Rom 3:31), and the Spirit-fulfillment language (Rom 8:4). No new covenant text states that all law-content is abolished.

The evidence tiers contain: 6 new Continues E-items explicitly linking the heart-writing to the Decalogue-writing by verb (kathab/grapho), medium (stone tablets), passage structure (Heb 10 ceremonial removal + moral affirmation), and lament-resolution pattern (Deu 5:29 + Jer 31:33). The Abolished position's claim is at the I-D (weakest inference) level and requires overriding multiple explicit statements and necessary implications.
