## Question
What specifically is "my law" (torati) that God promises to write on hearts in the new covenant? Investigate six angles: (1) Jeremiah's use of torati, (2) Deuteronomy 4:13 covenant identity, (3) Hebrews 10:1-16 structure, (4) Ezekiel 36:27 statutes and judgments, (5) 2 Corinthians 3:3 stone-to-heart contrast, (6) Romans 8:3-4 righteousness of the law.

### JUDGMENTS (from Nave's)
Nave's JUDGMENTS entry primarily covers divine judgments/punishments rather than the legal term mishpat. Key content relates to God's judgments on various peoples and nations. The entry for the legal term "judgments" (statutes/ordinances) is found under the broader LAW topic.

**Design of judgments:** EXO 14:17,18,31; LEV 10:3; DEU 29:22-28; PSA 9:16,20; 59:13; 83:16-18; ISA 26:9; 64:1,2; EZK 11:10-12; 12:16; 14:7,8; ROM 9:17,22; 1CO 10:6,11; REV 2:23

## Related Topics Discovered

### SECOND COVENANT (subsection under COVENANT)
The specific references for the second covenant: JER 31:31-34; HEB 8:4-13; 12:18-24; 13:20.
This is the core section directly relevant to the study question. Note that the covenant is explicitly identified as "the second" in contrast to the first (Sinai) covenant.

### TEMPORARY (subsection under LAW)
The "temporary" references under LAW include both ceremonial law cessation passages AND passages that are debated regarding the moral law. Key entries: 2CO 3:7-14; GAL 4:30,31; EPH 2:15; COL 2:14-23; HEB 8:4-13; 9:8-24; 10:1-18. These are the "abolished-position passages" that need examination in the study.

### Key Observation: Covenant = Ten Commandments
Under Nave's COVENANT entry, under "Instances Of" (with God), note the explicit entry: "Of the Ten Commandments: EXO 34:28; DEU 5:2,3; 9:9." This is directly relevant to identifying what "my law" in the new covenant refers to, since the Nave's topical dictionary itself links COVENANT and TEN COMMANDMENTS.
