> **2** A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
> **3** For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore [it is] of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
> **4** For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:

> **10** For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
> **11** And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
> **12** For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.

> **1** For the law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
> **2** For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.

> **8** Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and [offering] for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure [therein]; which are offered by the law;
> **9** Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
> **10** By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once [for all].
> **11** And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
> **12** But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
> **13** From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
> **14** For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
> **15** [Whereof] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
> **16** This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;

> **2** Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:
> **3** [Forasmuch as ye are] manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
> **4** And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
> **5** Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency [is] of God;
> **6** Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
> **7** But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away:
> **8** How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
> **9** For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
> **10** For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
> **11** For if that which is done away [was] glorious, much more that which remaineth [is] glorious.
> **12** Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
> **13** And not as Moses, [which] put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:
> **14** But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which [vail] is done away in Christ.
> **15** But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.

> **18** But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.

#### Romans 8:1-7 (Righteousness of the Law)
> **1** [There is] therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
> **2** For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
> **3** For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
> **4** That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
> **5** For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.

### Law-on-Heart OT Precedents

#### Psalm 37:30-31
> **30** The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.
> **31** The law of his God [is] in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.

#### Psalm 40:6-8
> **6** Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
> **7** Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book [it is] written of me,
> **8** I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law [is] within my heart.

#### Psalm 119:11
> Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.

#### Deuteronomy 6:4-6
> **4** Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God [is] one LORD:
> **5** And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
> **6** And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:

#### Deuteronomy 30:6, 14
> **6** And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.
> **14** But the word [is] very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.

#### Isaiah 51:6-7 (Righteousness + law in heart)
> **6** Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
> **7** Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart [is] my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.

*Note: This passage explicitly links "my righteousness shall not be abolished" (v.6) with "the people in whose heart is my law" (v.7). The same people who "know righteousness" are identified as those "in whose heart is my law." This connects the OT righteousness vocabulary (H6666 tsedaqah) directly to the law-on-hearts concept, anticipating the new covenant.*

#### Romans 2:14-15 (Gentiles, law written on hearts)
> **14** For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
> **15** Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and [their] thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)

#### Romans 13:8-10
> **8** Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
> **9** For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if [there be] any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
> **10** Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law.

> **12** For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.

> **10** [Which stood] only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed [on them] until the time of reformation.

#### Hebrews 12:18; 13:20
> **12:18** For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
> **13:20** Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,

> **25** But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

#### Galatians 4:24
> Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
