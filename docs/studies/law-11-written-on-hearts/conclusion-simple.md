# What Law Is Written on Hearts in the New Covenant?

## A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence

---

One of the most important promises in the Bible is found in the new covenant: God pledges to write His law on the hearts of His people. But what law, exactly, is being written there? Is it the Ten Commandments? A broader moral code? Or something entirely new? This study examines every passage where the Bible speaks of law written on hearts and follows the textual clues to identify what God is placing inside believers under the new covenant.

The answer matters because it determines whether the moral commandments God gave at Sinai carry forward into the Christian life or whether they were swept away along with the sacrificial system. The Bible addresses this question with remarkable clarity across both Testaments.

## The New Covenant Promise

The foundational text is Jeremiah 31:33, where God describes the new covenant He will make with His people:

> "But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people." (Jeremiah 31:33)

Two details in this verse are critical. First, God calls it "my law" -- not "a new law" or "a different law," but the law He already possesses and has already given. The word "my" is a possessive pronoun attached directly to "law" in the original Hebrew (torati). Throughout the book of Jeremiah, every time God uses this phrase "my law," He is referring to law the people already had and were violating. It was never something unfamiliar or yet-to-be-revealed.

Second, God says He will "write" this law on hearts. The Hebrew verb used here for "write" (kathab) is the very same verb used when God wrote the Ten Commandments on stone tablets:

> "And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me." (Deuteronomy 10:4)

The same Author (God), the same action (writing), and the same content (His law) appear in both passages. What changes is the surface: stone in the old covenant, the human heart in the new.

## The Covenant and the Ten Commandments

The Bible explicitly tells us what the terms of God's covenant were. Moses recorded this identification plainly:

> "And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone." (Deuteronomy 4:13)

"His covenant" equals "ten commandments" -- Moses states this as a direct equation. Then the very next verse introduces a separate category:

> "And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments." (Deuteronomy 4:14)

Moses distinguishes the covenant terms (the Ten Commandments, written on stone by God) from the additional statutes and judgments (taught by Moses and written in a book). When Jeremiah speaks of a "new covenant" in which "my law" is written on hearts, the connection is straightforward: the old covenant's terms were the Decalogue, and the new covenant writes the same law on a different medium.

## From Stone to Heart

The apostle Paul draws this connection explicitly when he describes the experience of believers under the new covenant:

> "Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart." (2 Corinthians 3:3)

Paul references "tables of stone" -- and only one law in all of Scripture was ever written on stone tablets: the Ten Commandments. No other law was engraved on stone. The additional laws of Moses were written in a book (Deuteronomy 31:24-26). So when Paul describes a transition from "tables of stone" to "fleshy tables of the heart," the content being transferred is necessarily the Decalogue. The medium changes; the content remains.

## God's Longing Fulfilled

Long before Jeremiah's prophecy, God expressed a heartfelt lament about His people. After delivering the Ten Commandments at Sinai, God said:

> "O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!" (Deuteronomy 5:29)

God wished His people had the inner capacity to keep His commandments -- the very commandments He had just spoken (the Ten Commandments recorded in Deuteronomy 5:6-21). Israel lacked the heart for it. The new covenant promise in Jeremiah 31:33 is the direct answer to this lament: God Himself would provide what was missing by writing the same commandments on the heart. The lament and the resolution share the same vocabulary (commandment-keeping), the same organ (the heart), and the same Author (God). What God wished for at Sinai, He promises to accomplish in the new covenant.

## The Spirit Makes It Possible

The prophet Ezekiel adds an essential dimension to this promise:

> "And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them." (Ezekiel 36:27)

The Spirit of God does not merely inform believers about God's requirements -- He empowers them to actually walk in God's statutes and keep His judgments. Again, the possessive pronouns appear: "my spirit," "my statutes," "my judgments." These are God's pre-existing moral requirements, not a newly invented code.

What does Ezekiel mean by "my statutes" and "my judgments"? Ezekiel himself defines these terms. In Ezekiel 18:5-9, the prophet describes a righteous man who walks in God's statutes and keeps His judgments: he does not worship idols, does not commit adultery, does not oppress others, restores pledges to debtors, feeds the hungry, and clothes the naked. The content is thoroughly moral.

Paul echoes this reality in the New Testament:

> "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." (Romans 8:4)

The law's moral standard is fulfilled -- not discarded -- in those who walk by the Spirit. And Paul makes clear that the limitation was never in the law itself but in human weakness:

> "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh." (Romans 8:3)

The law was not defective. Human flesh was. God's solution was not to discard the law but to empower its fulfillment through the Spirit -- the very dynamic promised in Ezekiel 36:27.

## Hebrews 10: Two Categories in One Passage

The book of Hebrews provides perhaps the clearest demonstration that the Bible distinguishes between what was removed in the new covenant and what was retained. Hebrews 10 opens by declaring the insufficiency and removal of the sacrificial system:

> "For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins." (Hebrews 10:4)

> "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second." (Hebrews 10:9)

The sacrificial offerings -- the repeated animal sacrifices of the old covenant worship system -- are taken away. Christ's single offering replaces them:

> "By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified." (Hebrews 10:14)

Then, in the very same sustained argument, the author of Hebrews quotes the new covenant promise:

> "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them." (Hebrews 10:16)

Within the same passage, the sacrificial system is removed and God's laws are written on hearts. The passage itself makes a distinction: what was taken away (the repeated sacrifices) is not the same thing as what is written on hearts (God's moral law). If the law written on hearts were the same thing being removed, the passage would contradict itself.

## The Fault Was with the People, Not the Law

The book of Hebrews explains why a new covenant was needed, and the reason is telling:

> "For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah." (Hebrews 8:8)

The fault was found "with them" -- with the people, not with the law. The Greek pronoun (autous) is grammatically unambiguous: the accusative plural masculine refers to the people. The new covenant was not needed because the moral law was defective but because the people failed to keep it. The solution is not the removal of the law but its internalization -- writing it on hearts rather than stone, empowered by the Spirit rather than dependent on human willpower.

Paul affirms the same principle:

> "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." (Romans 3:31)

Faith does not nullify the moral law. It establishes it.

## What Was Actually Abolished

The Bible uses specific vocabulary when describing what was removed under the new covenant. The words used in abolition passages -- dogma (ordinances/decrees), cheirographon (handwriting of ordinances), dikaiomata sarkos (carnal ordinances) -- are never applied to the Ten Commandments in any passage of Scripture.

Paul writes in Colossians:

> "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross." (Colossians 2:14)

The word "handwriting" (cheirographon) literally means "written by hand." The Ten Commandments, by contrast, were written by the finger of God (Exodus 31:18). Similarly, in Ephesians, Paul identifies what was abolished as "the law of commandments contained in ordinances" (Ephesians 2:15), again using the word dogma -- a term that never refers to the Decalogue in any of its five New Testament appearances.

The Bible's own vocabulary distinguishes what was taken away from what remains. The ceremonial ordinances were nailed to the cross. The moral law was written on hearts.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

Honesty with the text requires acknowledging what the Bible does not explicitly state as well as what it does.

No single verse states in so many words, "The Ten Commandments are the law written on hearts." The identification comes from combining multiple textual markers: the covenant-equals-Ten-Commandments equation in Deuteronomy 4:13, the shared "write" verb connecting stone-writing and heart-writing, the stone-tablet reference in 2 Corinthians 3:3, and the Hebrews 10 structure that removes sacrifices while affirming law on hearts. These markers converge strongly, but the connection requires following multiple threads rather than reading a single proof-text.

The Bible also does not restrict the law written on hearts to only the ten specific commandments and nothing beyond them. The Hebrew word torah has a range of meaning that can include broader moral instruction. While the textual markers point to the Decalogue as the primary content, the broader moral principles embodied in and derived from the Ten Commandments may also be included in what God writes on hearts.

Similarly, Ezekiel's vocabulary of "statutes and judgments" is broader than "ten commandments" in the narrow sense. What can be said is that Ezekiel defines this content in moral terms. What cannot be said is that these terms are identical to only the ten specific commandments and nothing else. The evidence points to moral law -- including the Decalogue and its moral principles as applied to life -- rather than a narrow restriction to ten propositions alone.

Finally, no new covenant passage anywhere states that all law-content is abolished. The claim that no binding moral obligation carries forward into the new covenant requires overriding every possessive pronoun in the new covenant promises ("my law," "my laws," "my statutes," "my judgments"), Paul's declaration that faith establishes the law (Romans 3:31), and the Spirit-fulfillment language of Romans 8:4. No verse makes this claim, and the claim contradicts what multiple passages plainly state.

## Conclusion

The Bible presents the new covenant not as the abolition of God's moral law but as its internalization. What was once written on stone is now written on hearts. What was once dependent on human effort is now empowered by the Holy Spirit. The content of the law remains; the administration changes.

Four lines of biblical evidence converge on this identification. First, Moses explicitly identifies the covenant as the Ten Commandments (Deuteronomy 4:13), and Jeremiah promises a new covenant that writes God's law on hearts (Jeremiah 31:33). Second, the same verb "write" connects God's authorship of the Decalogue on stone with His writing of the law on hearts. Third, Paul's reference to "tables of stone" in 2 Corinthians 3:3 identifies the content as the Decalogue, since no other law was ever written on stone. Fourth, Hebrews 10 removes the sacrificial system while affirming that God writes His laws on hearts -- distinguishing within the same argument between what is taken away and what endures.

The differences between the old and new covenants are real and significant, but they are structural, not moral. The location changes (stone to heart). The power changes (human effort to the Holy Spirit). The mediator changes (Moses to Christ). The blood changes (animals to Christ). The forgiveness changes (shadowed to accomplished). What does not change is the moral law itself -- God's own law, identified by His own possessive pronouns, written by His own hand on stone and now by His own Spirit on the human heart.
