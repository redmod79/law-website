# Verse Analysis

## Study Question
What specific law is "my law" written on hearts in Jeremiah 31:33 / Hebrews 8:10 / 10:16?

INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by those who say the law continues, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by those who say the law is abolished, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says.
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Jeremiah 31:31-34 (The New Covenant Prophecy)

**Context:** God speaks through Jeremiah to Israel and Judah during the late Judean monarchy (c. 626-586 BC). The broader context (vv.27-37) describes a future restoration. God promises a "new covenant" (berith chadashah) contrasted with the covenant made at the Exodus.

**Direct statement:** God will make a new covenant "not according to" the old one. In the new covenant, "I will put MY law (torati) in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts" (v.33). God will forgive iniquity and remember sin no more (v.34).

**Key observations:**

1. **The possessive pronoun "MY" (torati):** The Hebrew is torah (H8451) with the first-person common singular suffix. Jeremiah uses torati (God speaking) six times (Jer 6:19; 9:12; 16:11; 26:4; 31:33; 44:10). In every instance, the possessive "my" refers to God's pre-existing law that the people violated or are called to obey. The pronoun identifies the law as something God already possesses -- not something He will create for the first time.

2. **The verb "write" (kathab, H3789):** The Hebrew reads ekhtabenah -- "I will write it" -- using kathab with a 3rd-person feminine singular suffix referring back to torah (feminine). This is the same verb used for God writing the Decalogue on stone tablets (Exo 34:1; Deu 10:2, 4). The lexical link connects the heart-writing to the stone-writing.

3. **The covenant context:** Jeremiah 31:32 recalls "the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt." This is the Sinai covenant. Deuteronomy 4:13 identifies the terms of that covenant: "He declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone." The old covenant's TERMS were the Ten Commandments. The new covenant writes "MY law" on hearts rather than stone. The terms remain; the medium changes.

4. **What differs:** The text specifies what is "not according to" the old: the people "brake" the old covenant (v.32). The problem was the people's failure, not the law's deficiency. The new covenant resolves this by internalizing what was external.

5. **The permanence frame (vv.35-37):** God grounds the covenant's reliability in creation ordinances that cannot depart. "If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever."

**Cross-references:**
- Deu 4:13 identifies "his covenant" as the Ten Commandments -- the same covenant whose terms are now written on hearts.
- Deu 10:4 uses kathab for God writing the Decalogue on stone -- the same verb as Jer 31:33.
- Psa 40:8: "Thy law is within my heart" -- the Messianic anticipation of law internalized.
- Isa 51:7: "The people in whose heart is my law" -- same vocabulary of law-in-heart.

---

### Hebrews 8:1-13 (NT Exposition of Jeremiah 31)

**Context:** The author of Hebrews has been arguing for Christ's superior priesthood (chs. 5-7). Chapter 8 turns to the superior covenant. Christ ministers in the heavenly sanctuary (v.2), not the earthly copy (v.5). He mediates a "better covenant" on "better promises" (v.6).

**Direct statement:** Hebrews 8:10 quotes Jeremiah 31:33 in Greek: "I will put MY laws (nomous mou) into their mind, and write (epigrapso) them in their hearts." The possessive "my" (mou) is preserved from the Hebrew. The singular torah becomes the plural nomous in the LXX tradition.

**Key observations:**

1. **"Finding fault with them" (v.8):** The Greek reads memphomenos autous -- "finding fault with THEM" (accusative plural masculine = the people). The fault is not with the law or the covenant terms, but with the people who failed to keep them. This is consistent with Jer 31:32 ("which my covenant they brake").

2. **The content identification:** The author quotes Jeremiah 31:33-34 at length. The "my laws" (nomous mou) in v.10 are the same laws that existed in the old covenant -- the difference is the new location (mind and heart) and the new relational result ("I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people").

3. **Verse 13 -- "vanishing away":** "In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away." The subject of "vanishing" is the old covenant ARRANGEMENT (priesthood, sanctuary service, blood ratification), not the moral law content. This is confirmed by Hebrews 9:1, which immediately identifies the first covenant as consisting of "ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary," and 9:10 which identifies these as "carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation."

**Cross-references:**
- Heb 10:16 quotes the same Jeremiah passage a second time.
- Heb 9:1-10 specifies what the "first covenant" arrangements consisted of -- ceremonial service.
- Rom 3:31: Paul denies that faith makes the law void.

### Hebrews 10:1-18 (Sacrificial Removal + Law on Hearts)

**Context:** The author continues the argument about Christ's superior offering. This passage contains both the removal of the ceremonial system and the affirmation of law written on hearts within a single sustained argument.

**Direct statement:** Verses 1-9 identify and remove the sacrificial system: "the law having a shadow of good things to come...can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect" (v.1); "it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins" (v.4); "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second" (v.9). Then verses 15-17 affirm the law written on hearts: "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws (nomous mou) into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them" (v.16).

**Key observations:**

1. **The dual operation in one passage:** Hebrews 10:1-9 removes the sacrificial system ("sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not" -- vv.5-8). Hebrews 10:9 states "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second." In context, "the first" = repeated sacrifices; "the second" = the doing of God's will through Christ's one offering. Then vv.15-17 quote Jeremiah 31:33-34: "I will put my laws into their hearts." The same passage cannot simultaneously remove and promise to write the moral law on hearts. The passage removes the ceremonial while affirming the moral law.

2. **Verse 14:** "By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified." Christ's single sacrifice accomplishes what the repeated animal sacrifices could not.

3. **Verse 18:** "Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin." The sacrificial system ends because forgiveness is accomplished. The law written on hearts remains.

4. **The structure itself evidences a distinction between ceremonial and moral law:** Within one sustained argument, the author removes one category (sacrifices) and affirms another (law on hearts). This structural distinction supports the Continues position's claim that the Bible itself distinguishes between categories of law.

**Cross-references:**
- Heb 10:1 uses "shadow" (skia) -- the same typological vocabulary used in Col 2:17 and Heb 8:5 for the ceremonial system.
- Psa 40:6-8 is quoted in Heb 10:5-7: "Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire...I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart."

### Ezekiel 36:25-28 (Spirit + Statutes/Judgments)

**Context:** God speaks through Ezekiel to exiled Israel (c. 593-571 BC). The passage promises cleansing, a new heart, a new spirit, and Spirit-enabled obedience.

**Direct statement:** "And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes (behuqqotay, [H2708](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2708/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} + 1st person suffix), and ye shall keep my judgments (mishpatay, [H4941](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4941/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} + 1st person suffix), and do them" (v.27).

**Key observations:**

1. **Possessive pronouns again:** "MY statutes" (behuqqotay) and "MY judgments" (mishpatay) -- the same possessive pattern as Jer 31:33 ("MY law"). These are God's pre-existing statutes and judgments.

2. **The Spirit as the enabling agent:** The new heart (v.26) and new spirit enable what the old covenant arrangement could not produce -- actual obedience. This parallels Rom 8:3-4: the law could not accomplish its purpose "through the flesh," but God sent His Son so that "the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."

3. **Vocabulary broader than the Decalogue:** Chuqqot (statutes) and mishpatim (judgments) are broader terms than the "ten commandments" specifically. Deu 4:13-14 distinguishes "his covenant, even ten commandments" (v.13) from "statutes and judgments" taught through Moses (v.14). This raises the question of whether Eze 36:27 points to something broader than the Decalogue alone.

4. **Ezekiel's own definition of the moral content:** Ezekiel 18:5-9 defines what it means to "walk in my statutes" and "keep my judgments": no idolatry, no adultery, no oppression, honesty in transactions, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked. This is moral content, not ceremonial. The Spirit cannot cause obedience to a ceremonial system that the Spirit's own coming renders obsolete (Heb 10:9).

5. **Parallel with Eze 11:19-20:** "That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them." The same promise of heart-renewal for obedience to God's statutes and ordinances.

**Cross-references:**
- Jer 31:33: the parallel new covenant promise with "my law" instead of "my statutes/judgments."
- Rom 8:4: "the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us" -- the NT equivalent of Spirit-caused obedience to God's righteous requirements.
- Eze 37:24: "They shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them."

---

### Ezekiel 11:19-20 (New Heart/Spirit)

**Context:** God speaks to Ezekiel about the exiled Israelites. The passage parallels Eze 36:26-27 closely.

**Direct statement:** "I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh: that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them."

**Key observations:**

1. **The stony heart/heart of flesh contrast:** The "stony heart" removed here corresponds to the "tables of stone" in 2 Cor 3:3. The "heart of flesh" corresponds to "fleshy tables of the heart." The law moves from external stone to internal heart.

2. **Purpose clause:** The heart change is purposive -- "THAT they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances." The new heart enables law-keeping, not law-abolition.

3. **Same relational formula:** "They shall be my people, and I will be their God" -- the same relational outcome stated in Jer 31:33 and Heb 8:10.

### 2 Corinthians 3:1-18 (Stone to Heart Contrast)

**Context:** Paul defends his apostolic ministry by describing the superiority of the new covenant ministry. He contrasts the ministry of the letter (old covenant) with the ministry of the Spirit (new covenant).

**Direct statement:** "Not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart" (v.3). "The ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious...which glory was to be done away" (v.7). "The ministration of the spirit...rather glorious" (v.8). "The ministration of condemnation...the ministration of righteousness" (v.9).

**Key observations:**

1. **The stone-to-heart transfer (v.3):** Paul says the Corinthians are Christ's epistle, "written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart." The "tables of stone" are the Decalogue tablets (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10). The content previously written on stone is now written on the heart by the Spirit. This directly identifies what is written on hearts as the same content that was on stone -- the Decalogue.

2. **What is "done away" (katargoumenen):** In v.7, the participle katargoumenen is applied to "the glory" (ten doxan) of Moses' face, not to the law itself. The grammar: katargoumenen is feminine/neuter participle; doxa is feminine; nomos is masculine. The standard grammatical reading is that the fading glory (on Moses' face) is what was "done away," not the law written on the stones. Paul says the MINISTRATION was glorious and the glory was transient, not that the law was abolished.

3. **Ministration vs. content distinction:** Paul contrasts two ministrations (diakoniai): the ministration of death/condemnation (old covenant administration, vv.7, 9) and the ministration of the Spirit/righteousness (new covenant administration, vv.8, 9). The change is in the administration, not the content. The same law that produced condemnation when externally imposed produces righteousness when internally written by the Spirit.

4. **"The ministration of death, written and engraven in stones" (v.7):** This description identifies the Decalogue specifically (written on stone tablets). Paul calls it the "ministration of death" because the law, when external and unaccompanied by the Spirit, produces condemnation for sinners. This is consistent with Rom 7:10: "The commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death." The law's condemnation role is temporary (the fading glory); its content is permanent (written on hearts).

5. **"Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (v.17):** The Spirit does not liberate from the law but enables obedience to it. James calls the moral law "the perfect law of liberty" (Jas 1:25).

**Cross-references:**
- Exo 31:18: "tables of stone, written with the finger of God" -- identifies what was on stone.
- Jer 31:33: "write it in their hearts" -- the same content relocated.
- Rom 8:2-4: "the law of the Spirit of life" frees from "the law of sin and death" so that "the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us."

### Romans 8:1-7 (Righteousness of the Law)

**Context:** Paul has just described the believer's struggle with sin and the law in Romans 7. Chapter 8 opens with the solution: no condemnation for those in Christ; the Spirit enables what the law could not produce through sinful flesh.

**Direct statement:** "That the righteousness (to dikaioma, [G1345](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1345/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, singular) of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (v.4).

**Key observations:**

1. **"The righteousness of the law" (to dikaioma tou nomou):** Dikaioma is singular, denoting a single unified righteous requirement. This contrasts with the plural dikaiomata used in Heb 9:1, 10 for the multiple ceremonial regulations ("ordinances of divine service," "carnal ordinances"). The singular form in Rom 8:4 points to the law's unified moral standard.

2. **"Fulfilled in us":** The verb plerothe (passive subjunctive of pleroo) means "might be fulfilled." The law's righteous requirement is not abolished but fulfilled -- actively lived out -- in those who walk by the Spirit.

3. **"The law could not do...weak through the flesh" (v.3):** The law's limitation was not internal (the law is "holy, just, good, spiritual" -- Rom 7:12, 14) but external -- it was "weak through the flesh." Human inability was the problem. God's solution: send His Son and His Spirit so the law's requirement can be fulfilled.

4. **"Not subject to the law of God" (v.7):** The carnal mind is "enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." This presupposes the continuing authority of "the law of God" -- the problem is the carnal mind's inability to submit, not the law's non-existence.

5. **The Spirit-law connection:** The Spirit enables obedience to the law (v.4). This is the NT equivalent of Eze 36:27: "I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes." Both passages describe the Spirit producing law-obedience.

**Cross-references:**
- Eze 36:27: Spirit causing obedience to statutes/judgments.
- Jer 31:33: Law written on hearts.
- Gal 5:16-18: "Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh."

### Deuteronomy 4:13-14 (Covenant Identity)

**Context:** Moses recounts the Sinai events to the second generation of Israelites before entering the Promised Land.

**Direct statement:** "He declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land."

**Key observations:**

1. **Explicit identification:** "His covenant" = "ten commandments." This is not an inference but a direct equation stated by Moses. The apposition "even ten commandments" (literally "ten words/devarim") identifies the covenant terms.

2. **Consecutive-verse distinction:** V.13 identifies the covenant terms as the Decalogue (God wrote them on stone). V.14 separately identifies "statutes and judgments" that God commanded Moses to teach. Two categories of law in two consecutive verses, delivered by different agents (God directly vs. Moses as mediator).

3. **Interpretive key for Jer 31:33:** Since Deu 4:13 identifies "his covenant" as the Ten Commandments, and Jer 31:33 promises a "new covenant" in which "my law" (torati) is written on hearts rather than stone, the interpretive connection is: the old covenant wrote the Decalogue on stone; the new covenant writes the same law on hearts. The covenant terms (Decalogue) are the constant; the medium (stone vs. hearts) changes.

**Cross-references:**
- Exo 34:28: "the words of the covenant, the ten commandments."
- Deu 9:9, 11: "tables of the covenant."
- Jer 31:31-33: "new covenant...my law...write it in their hearts."

---

### Psalm 40:6-8 (Law Within the Heart -- Messianic)

**Context:** A Messianic psalm quoted in Hebrews 10:5-7. The Messiah speaks of God's will and law.

**Direct statement:** "Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire...burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart."

**Key observations:**

1. **Sacrifice contrasted with law in heart:** The passage dismisses the sacrificial system and affirms "thy law is within my heart." The same pattern as Heb 10: sacrifices removed, law on hearts affirmed.

2. **Messianic fulfillment:** Hebrews 10:5-7 applies this to Christ, who comes to do God's will (replacing the sacrificial system). The Messiah delights in God's law within His heart.

3. **The law-in-heart concept predates the new covenant prophecy:** Even before Jeremiah's explicit new covenant promise, the Psalms describe God's law as being "within the heart" of the righteous (Psa 37:31) and of the Messiah (Psa 40:8).

---

### Psalm 37:31 (Law in the Heart of the Righteous)

**Direct statement:** "The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide."

**Key observation:** The righteous person is characterized by having God's law in the heart. This is the same concept as the new covenant promise, but described as already present in the godly individual.

---

### Isaiah 51:6-7 (Righteousness + Law in Heart)

**Direct statement:** "My salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished. Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law."

**Key observations:**

1. **Righteousness and law linked:** "My righteousness shall not be abolished" is immediately followed by "the people in whose heart is my law." The people who "know righteousness" are the people who have God's law in their hearts.

2. **"Shall not be abolished":** The same concept expressed negatively -- God's righteousness (and by implication, His law in the heart) will endure permanently.

---

### Romans 2:14-15 (Gentiles, Law Written on Hearts)

**Direct statement:** "The Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law...which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness."

**Key observations:**

1. **"The work of the law written in their hearts":** Even Gentiles who have not received the Sinai revelation show evidence of "the law" written on their hearts. The content they obey "by nature" is "the things contained in the law" -- moral principles.

2. **Pre-new-covenant law on hearts:** Paul describes a natural-law awareness that parallels the new covenant promise. The moral law's content is accessible even apart from the Sinai tablets.

---

### Abolished-Position Passages

#### Galatians 3:19, 24-25

**Direct statement:** "The law...was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come...the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ...after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."

**Key observations:**

1. **Referent ambiguity:** "The law" (ho nomos) does not specify which category of law. The referent is debated.
2. **"Till the seed should come":** The temporal marker "till" suggests a function that ends -- but the text says the pedagogical FUNCTION ends, not the law's existence. Rom 3:31 states faith ESTABLISHES the law. *(Examined in depth in law-10.)*

#### 2 Corinthians 3:7-11

**Key observations:** Analyzed above under the 2 Cor 3 section. What is "done away" is the glory (grammatically), not the law. The ministration changes; the content transfers from stone to heart. *(Examined in depth in law-08.)*

#### Hebrews 8:13

**Direct statement:** "In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old."

**Key observation:** What is "old" and "vanishing" is the covenant ARRANGEMENT (priesthood, sacrifices, sanctuary service -- identified by Heb 9:1-10), not the moral law content. The same chapter that says the first covenant is vanishing (8:13) says "my laws" will be written on hearts (8:10). *(Examined in depth in law-09, law-10.)*

#### Colossians 2:14-17

**Direct statement:** "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances...nailing it to his cross...Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow."

**Key observations:**
1. The Greek uses dogma (G1378) for what was nailed -- a word never used for the Decalogue.
2. Cheirographon means "hand-written" -- the Decalogue was written by God's finger, not by hand.
3. The referent of "sabbath days" is ambiguous between annual ceremonial sabbaths and weekly Sabbaths.
*(Examined in depth in law-08.)*

#### Ephesians 2:15

**Direct statement:** "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances."

**Key observation:** The qualifier "in ordinances" (en dogmasin) specifies which commandments were abolished -- those classified as ordinances/decrees. Dogma is never used for the Decalogue. In the same epistle, Paul cites the 5th commandment as binding (Eph 6:2-3). *(Examined in depth in law-08.)*

---

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: The Possessive Pronoun Chain
Every new covenant passage uses a possessive pronoun identifying the law as God's pre-existing law:
- Jer 31:33: "MY law" (torati)
- Heb 8:10: "MY laws" (nomous mou)
- Heb 10:16: "MY laws" (nomous mou)
- Eze 36:27: "MY statutes...MY judgments" (behuqqotay...mishpatay)
- Eze 11:20: "MY statutes...MINE ordinances" (behuqqotay...mishpatay)

In every case, the possessive pronoun points to law already in God's possession -- not something new.

### Pattern 2: The kathab/grapho Verb Connection
The same verb for "write" connects the stone-writing and the heart-writing:
- Deu 10:4: "He wrote (kathab) on the tables...the ten commandments"
- Jer 31:33: "I will...write (kathab) it in their hearts"
- Heb 8:10: "I will...write (epigrapso, from grapho) them in their hearts"

The writing action is the same; the surface changes.

### Pattern 3: Stone-to-Heart Transfer
The explicit contrast between stone and heart in 2 Cor 3:3 ("not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart") identifies the content: what was on stone (the Decalogue) is now written on hearts.

### Pattern 4: Dual Operation in Hebrews 10
The same passage removes the ceremonial (vv.1-9: sacrifices) and affirms the moral (vv.15-17: law on hearts). This structural distinction within a single sustained argument evidences a biblical differentiation between ceremonial and moral law.

### Pattern 5: Spirit-Enabled Obedience
Multiple passages connect the Spirit with obedience to God's law:
- Eze 36:27: Spirit causes walking in "my statutes"
- Rom 8:4: Spirit fulfills "the righteousness of the law"
- Gal 5:16-18: Walking by the Spirit prevents fulfilling the flesh
- 1 Jhn 3:24: Spirit-indwelling confirmed by commandment-keeping

### Pattern 6: The Berith-Decalogue Equation
Deu 4:13 explicitly states "his covenant, even ten commandments." Exo 34:28 states "the words of the covenant, the ten commandments." When Jer 31:31 speaks of a "new berith" and v.33 promises to write "my torah" on hearts, the interpretive connection is: the old berith's terms (the Decalogue) are the same terms now written on hearts in the new berith.

---

## Connections Between Passages

### The Jeremiah-Hebrews-Ezekiel Triad
Three prophetic traditions converge on the same promise:
- **Jeremiah 31:33:** "MY law" on hearts
- **Hebrews 8:10; 10:16:** "MY laws" on hearts (quoting Jeremiah)
- **Ezekiel 36:27:** Spirit-caused obedience to "MY statutes/judgments"
- **Ezekiel 11:19-20:** New heart for walking in "MY statutes/ordinances"

Each passage uses possessive pronouns, each promises internalization, and each connects to obedience to God's pre-existing moral requirements.

### The Romans 7-8 Bridge
Romans 7 establishes that the law is "holy, just, good, spiritual" (vv.12, 14), identified by the Decalogue's 10th commandment (v.7). Romans 8 provides the resolution: the Spirit enables the law's righteous requirement (dikaioma, singular) to be fulfilled in believers (v.4). This bridge connects Paul's Decalogue identification in ch.7 to the Spirit-enabled law-fulfillment in ch.8, which is the NT exposition of the new covenant promise.

### The Psalm 40 / Hebrews 10 Connection
Psalm 40:6-8 contrasts sacrifices (which God does not ultimately desire) with "thy law within my heart." Hebrews 10:5-7 quotes this psalm and then, in vv.15-17, quotes Jeremiah 31:33 (law on hearts). The connection: the Messiah's delight in God's law (Psa 40:8) is the same law written on hearts in the new covenant (Jer 31:33; Heb 10:16).

---

## Word Study Insights

### Torah (H8451) in Jeremiah
Jeremiah uses torah 11 times. With the possessive "my" (God speaking): Jer 6:19; 9:12; 16:11; 26:4; 31:33; 44:10. In every case, "my law" refers to God's existing moral requirements that the people violated. There is no instance where "my torah" in Jeremiah introduces a new or different law.

### Kathab (H3789) -- The Writing Connection
God is the subject of kathab in eight Decalogue-writing passages (Exo 24:12; 31:18; 32:16; 34:1; Deu 5:22; 9:10; 10:2, 4) and one heart-writing passage (Jer 31:33). The same divine author, the same writing verb, different surfaces.

### Dikaioma (G1345) -- Singular vs. Plural
Rom 8:4 uses the singular dikaioma (one righteous requirement = the unified moral standard). Heb 9:1, 10 use the plural dikaiomata (multiple ceremonial regulations). This singular/plural distinction supports the identification of Rom 8:4's "righteousness of the law" as the unified moral standard, distinct from the multiple ceremonial regulations.

### Dogma (G1378) -- Never Used for the Decalogue
All five NT occurrences of dogma (Luk 2:1; Acts 16:4; 17:7; Eph 2:15; Col 2:14) refer to governmental decrees, ecclesiastical decisions, or ceremonial ordinances. Dogma is never applied to the Ten Commandments or the moral law. The two "abolition" passages (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14) use dogma for what was removed, specifying the referent as ordinances, not the moral law.

### Katargeo (G2673) -- The Dual Usage
Paul uses katargeo for what is "done away" in 2 Cor 3:7, 11, 13 -- but in each case, the grammatical referent is the glory or the ministration, not the law. The same Paul emphatically denies that faith katargeo-s the law in Rom 3:31: "Do we then make void (katargoumen) the law through faith? God forbid."

### Does "my law" (torati) encompass more than the Decalogue?
Torah has a broad semantic range -- it can mean the Pentateuch, the entire body of divine instruction, specific ritual instructions, or the Decalogue. The question is which referent applies in Jer 31:33.

The textual markers point to the Decalogue specifically: (a) the berith = Decalogue equation in Deu 4:13; (b) the kathab verb connection linking stone-writing to heart-writing; (c) the stone-to-heart contrast in 2 Cor 3:3 identifying the Decalogue as the stone content; (d) the Heb 10 structure removing ceremonial while affirming law on hearts. The convergence of these markers identifies the Decalogue as the primary referent.

At the same time, Ezekiel 36:27 uses "my statutes and my judgments" -- vocabulary broader than the Decalogue alone. Eze 18:5-9 defines this in moral terms (no idolatry, no adultery, honesty, mercy). The broader vocabulary does not contradict the Decalogue identification but may indicate that the moral principles encoded in the Decalogue -- which are expounded in the statutes and judgments -- are included in the heart-writing. The Decalogue is the core, and its moral principles (as expounded throughout Scripture) are the content written on hearts.

### Does 2 Corinthians 3:7 call the Decalogue the "ministration of death"?
Paul calls the stone-engraved law's administration "the ministration of death" (v.7). The law written on stone, when it encounters sinful flesh, produces condemnation (v.9) -- not because the law is deficient ("the law is holy, just, good, spiritual" -- Rom 7:12, 14) but because the flesh cannot keep it (Rom 8:3). The "death" and "condemnation" are functions of the old covenant ADMINISTRATION (law on stone, no Spirit-enablement), not properties of the law itself. In the new covenant, the same law written on hearts by the Spirit becomes "the ministration of righteousness" (v.9).

### Does Ezekiel 36:27's broader vocabulary undermine the Decalogue identification?
The terms chuqqot (statutes) and mishpatim (judgments) are broader than the Ten Commandments alone. Deu 4:13-14 distinguishes the "covenant" (= Decalogue) from "statutes and judgments." Eze 36:27 uses the broader terms. This does not contradict the Jeremiah/Hebrews identification of "my law/my laws" as the Decalogue; rather, the Ezekiel passage may describe the Spirit enabling obedience to the full moral content -- the Decalogue and its moral applications. Ezekiel's own definition of "walking in my statutes" (Eze 18:5-9) is moral, not ceremonial.
