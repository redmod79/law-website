## [H8451](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8451/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- torah (law, instruction)
**Original:** תּוֹרָה (towrah)
**Transliteration:** towrah
**Pronunciation:** to-raw
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** From yarah (H3384, to throw/teach); a precept or statute, especially the Decalogue or Pentateuch -- law.
**Total OT occurrences:** 244 (219 BLB count)

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| the law | 60 | 24.6% |
| of the law | 28 | 11.5% |
| law | 24 | 9.8% |
| thy law | 20 | 8.2% |
| in the law | 19 | 7.8% |
| my law | 10 | 4.1% |
| in my law | 4 | 1.6% |

### Usage with Possessive Suffixes
Critical for identifying "my law" (torati) in Jer 31:33:
- **"my law" (torati)** -- 10 occurrences: Used by God to refer to His law. Key instances: Jer 31:33 ("I will put MY law in their inward parts"); Psa 78:1; Jer 6:19; 9:12; 16:11; 26:4; 44:10
- **"thy law"** -- 20 occurrences: Used in prayer/address to God. Key: Psa 40:8; 119:11, 18, 29, 34, etc.
- **"his law"** -- Context determines whether "his" refers to God's law or a human's

### Range of Meaning
Torah covers multiple law-types in the OT:
1. Specific instructions (e.g., "the law of the burnt offering" -- Lev 6:2)
2. The Pentateuch as a whole (e.g., "the book of the law" -- Deu 31:26)
3. The Decalogue specifically (e.g., Psa 40:8 "thy law is within my heart"; Psa 119)
4. Divine instruction generally (e.g., Isa 2:3 "the law shall go forth of Zion")

### Jeremiah's Usage of Torah
In Jeremiah, torah appears 11 times. With possessive "my" (God speaking): Jer 6:19; 9:12; 16:11; 26:4; 31:33; 44:10. In every instance, it refers to God's pre-existing law that the people violated or are called to obey.

## [H3789](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3789/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- kathab (to write)
**Original:** כָּתַב (kathab)
**Transliteration:** kathab
**Pronunciation:** kaw-thab
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** A primitive root; to grave, by implication, to write (describe, inscribe, prescribe, subscribe).
**Total OT occurrences:** 248 (223 BLB count)

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| written | 89 | 35.9% |
| wrote | 14 | 5.6% |
| write | 5 | 2.0% |

### Instances Where God Is the Subject of Writing
Critical connection: The SAME verb (kathab) is used for both writing on stone AND writing on hearts.

**God writing on stone (the Decalogue):**
- Exo 24:12 -- "tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written"
- Exo 31:18 -- "tables of stone, written with the finger of God"
- Exo 32:16 -- "the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables"
- Exo 34:1 -- "I will write upon [these] tables the words that were in the first tables"
- Deu 5:22 -- "he wrote them in two tables of stone"
- Deu 9:10 -- "tables of stone written with the finger of God"
- Deu 10:2 -- "I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables"
- Deu 10:4 -- "And he wrote on the tables...the ten commandments"

**God writing on hearts (new covenant):**
- Jer 31:33 -- "I will put my law in their inward parts, and WRITE (kathab) it in their hearts"

**The lexical link:** The verb kathab used in Jer 31:33 for writing on hearts is the identical verb used in Exo 34:1 and Deu 10:2, 4 for God writing the Decalogue on stone. This lexical connection identifies the content: what was written on stone is what will be written on hearts.

### Other Notable Uses of kathab
- Psa 40:8 -- "in the volume of the book it is written (kathab) of me" (Messianic; quoted in Heb 10:7)
- Pro 3:3 -- "write (kathab) them upon the table of thine heart" (mercy and truth)
- Pro 7:3 -- "write (kathab) them upon the table of thine heart" (commandments)
- Jer 17:1 -- "The sin of Judah is written (kathab) with a pen of iron...upon the table of their heart"

## [H3820](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3820/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- leb (heart)
**Original:** לֵב (leb)
**Transliteration:** leb
**Pronunciation:** labe
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** The heart; used figuratively for the feelings, the will, and even the intellect; likewise for the centre of anything.
**Total OT occurrences:** 649 (593 BLB count)

### Usage in Covenant and Law Contexts
- **Jer 31:33** -- "write it in their hearts (leb)" -- new covenant destination
- **Psa 37:31** -- "The law of his God is in his heart (leb)"
- **Psa 40:8** -- "thy law is within my heart (leb)"
- **Jer 24:7** -- "I will give them an heart (leb) to know me"
- **Eze 11:19** -- "I will give them one heart (leb)"
- **Eze 36:26** -- "A new heart (leb) also will I give you"

## [H3824](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3824/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- lebab (heart, inner man)
**Original:** לֵבָב (lebab)
**Transliteration:** lebab
**Pronunciation:** lay-bawb
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** Used also like the heart (as the most interior organ).
**Total OT occurrences:** 267 (252 BLB count)

### Usage in Covenant/Law Contexts
- **Deu 6:5-6** -- "love the LORD thy God with all thine heart (lebab)...these words...shall be in thine heart (lebab)"
- **Deu 30:6** -- "circumcise thine heart (lebab)"
- **Deu 30:14** -- "in thy mouth, and in thy heart (lebab)"
- **Deu 4:9** -- "lest they depart from thy heart (lebab)"
- **Deu 4:29** -- "if thou seek him with all thy heart (lebab)"
- **Deu 5:29** -- "O that there were such an heart (lebab) in them"

Both leb and lebab are used interchangeably in covenant contexts. The new covenant promise involves the same inward reality (the heart) that Deuteronomy already pointed toward as the ideal location for God's law.

## [H2706](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2706/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- choq (statute, decree) / [H2708](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2708/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- chuqqah (statute, ordinance)
**[H2706](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2706/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} Original:** חֹק (choq)
**Transliteration:** choq
**Pronunciation:** khoke
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** An enactment; hence, an appointment (of time, space, quantity, labor or usage).
**Total OT occurrences:** 134 (127 BLB count)

**[H2708](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2708/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} Original:** חֻקָּה (chuqqah)
**Transliteration:** chuqqah
**Pronunciation:** khook-kaw
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** Feminine of choq, and meaning substantially the same.
**Total OT occurrences:** 116 (104 BLB count)

### Key Translations (H2706)
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| the statutes | 14 | 10.4% |
| thy statutes | 14 | 10.4% |
| statutes | 13 | 9.7% |
| a statute | 7 | 5.2% |
| his statutes | 7 | 5.2% |
| my statutes | 4 | 3.0% |

### Key Translations (H2708)
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| my statutes | 24 | 20.7% |
| a statute | 13 | 11.2% |
| in my statutes | 9 | 7.8% |
| ordinance | 4 | 3.4% |

### Usage in New Covenant Passages
- **Eze 36:27** -- "cause you to walk in MY statutes (chuqqah, H2708)"
- **Eze 11:20** -- "walk in MY statutes (chuqqah, H2708)"
- **Eze 37:24** -- "they shall also walk in MY judgments (mishpat) and observe MY statutes (chuqqah)"

### Relationship to the Decalogue
Choq/chuqqah is broader than the Decalogue alone. These terms cover various categories of God's legislation. However, in Ezekiel's new covenant passages, the possessive "MY statutes" with the promise of Spirit-enabled obedience parallels the Jeremiah 31:33 promise. The question is whether "MY statutes" in Eze 36:27 refers to the same law-content as "MY law" in Jer 31:33 or to something broader.

Key observation from Deu 4:13-14: The "covenant" (= ten commandments) and the "statutes and judgments" are presented as distinct but related categories. Moses says God declared "his covenant...even ten commandments" (v.13) and then "the LORD commanded me at that time to TEACH you statutes and judgments" (v.14). The Decalogue was God's direct covenant; the statutes/judgments were taught through Moses as mediator.

## [H4941](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4941/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- mishpat (judgment, ordinance)
**Original:** מִשְׁפָּט (mishpat)
**Transliteration:** mishpat
**Pronunciation:** mish-pawt
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** Properly, a verdict (favorable or unfavorable) pronounced judicially; a sentence or formal decree; the act, the place, the suit, the crime, and the penalty; abstractly, justice.
**Total OT occurrences:** 448 (421 BLB count)

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| judgment | 69 | 15.4% |
| my judgments | 23 | 5.1% |
| judgments | 15 | 3.3% |
| right | 7 | 1.6% |
| manner | 6 | 1.3% |

### Usage in New Covenant Passages
- **Eze 36:27** -- "ye shall keep MY judgments (mishpat)"
- **Eze 11:20** -- "keep MINE ordinances (mishpat)"
- **Eze 37:24** -- "walk in MY judgments (mishpat)"

### Relationship to Decalogue and Broader Legislation
Like choq, mishpat has a broader semantic range than the Decalogue. It covers judicial decisions, case law, and procedural rules. In Deu 4:14, "statutes and judgments" are taught by Moses separately from the "covenant" (ten commandments) of v.13.

## [H1285](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1285/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- berith (covenant)
**Original:** בְּרִית (berith)
**Transliteration:** berith
**Pronunciation:** ber-eeth
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** From barath (in the sense of cutting); a compact (because made by passing between pieces of flesh).
**Total OT occurrences:** 317 (284 BLB count)

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| of the covenant | 60 | 18.9% |
| my covenant | 45 | 14.2% |
| covenant | 40 | 12.6% |
| a covenant | 40 | 12.6% |
| the covenant | 27 | 8.5% |
| his covenant | 14 | 4.4% |

### Critical Identification: "Covenant" = Ten Commandments
- **Deu 4:13** -- "He declared unto you HIS COVENANT (berith), which he commanded you to perform, even TEN COMMANDMENTS"
- **Exo 34:28** -- "the words of THE COVENANT (berith), THE TEN COMMANDMENTS"
- **Deu 9:9** -- "the tables of stone, even the tables of THE COVENANT (berith)"
- **Deu 9:11** -- "the two tables of stone, even the tables of THE COVENANT (berith)"

This explicit identification is the interpretive key: when Jer 31:31-33 speaks of a "new covenant" (berith chadashah), the OLD covenant whose terms will be relocated is identified as the Ten Commandments.

## [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- nomos (law)
**Original:** νόμος (nomos)
**Transliteration:** nomos
**Pronunciation:** nom'-os
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** From nemo (to parcel out, especially food or grazing); law.
**Total NT occurrences:** 169 (197 BLB count)

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| law | 95 | 56.2% |
| the law | 49 | 29.0% |
| of the law | 14 | 8.3% |

### Usage with "mou" (my) in Hebrews
In the Greek NT quotations of Jer 31:33:
- **Heb 8:10** -- "I will put MY LAWS (nomous mou) into their mind, and write them in their hearts"
- **Heb 10:16** -- "I will put MY LAWS (nomous mou) into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them"

Note the plural "laws" (nomous) in the Greek, where the Hebrew has the singular "law" (torah). The Hebrews author, quoting the LXX, uses the plural, but the possessive "my" (mou) is preserved in both, identifying these as God's pre-existing laws.

### Semantic Range in Paul
Paul uses nomos with multiple referents:
- The Mosaic law as a whole (Rom 7:1-6)
- The moral law / Decalogue specifically (Rom 7:7 -- identifies by 10th commandment)
- A principle or rule (Rom 7:21, 23 -- "a law" = principle)
- The law of the Spirit (Rom 8:2)
Context determines which meaning applies.

## [G1345](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1345/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- dikaioma (righteous requirement)
**Original:** δικαίωμα (dikaioma)
**Transliteration:** dikaioma
**Pronunciation:** dik-ah'-yo-mah
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun
**Definition:** An equitable deed; by implication, a statute or decision.
**Total NT occurrences:** 10

### All Translations
| Translation | Count | Verses |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| ordinances | 3 | Luk 1:6; Heb 9:1; Heb 9:10 |
| righteousness | 3 | Rom 2:26; Rom 8:4; Rev 19:8 |
| judgment | 1 | Rom 1:32 |
| justification | 1 | Rom 5:16 |
| the righteousness | 1 | Rom 5:18 |
| judgments | 1 | Rev 15:4 |

### Singular vs. Plural Usage
**Singular (to dikaioma):** Rom 1:32; 2:26; 5:16; 5:18; 8:4
**Plural (ta dikaiomata):** Luk 1:6; Heb 9:1; 9:10; Rev 15:4; 19:8

**ROM 8:4 specifically:** "That THE RIGHTEOUSNESS (to dikaioma -- SINGULAR) of the law might be fulfilled in us." The singular form here denotes a single, unified righteous requirement -- the moral standard of the law.

**HEB 9:1, 10:** "ORDINANCES (dikaiomata -- PLURAL) of divine service" and "carnal ORDINANCES (dikaiomata -- PLURAL), imposed [on them] until the time of reformation." The PLURAL form is used for the multiple ceremonial regulations.

This singular/plural distinction is relevant: Rom 8:4 speaks of THE righteousness (one standard), while Heb 9 speaks of ORDINANCES (multiple ceremonial regulations).

## [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- dogma (ordinance, decree)
**Original:** δόγμα (dogma)
**Transliteration:** dogma
**Pronunciation:** dog'-mah
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun
**Definition:** From the base of dokeo; a law (civil, ceremonial or ecclesiastical).
**Total NT occurrences:** 5

### All Occurrences
| Verse | Translation | Context |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Luk 2:1 | a decree | Caesar Augustus' census decree |
| Act 16:4 | decrees | Apostolic council decisions |
| Act 17:7 | decrees | Caesar's decrees |
| Eph 2:15 | of ordinances | "law of commandments contained in ordinances" |
| Col 2:14 | ordinances | "handwriting of ordinances" |

### Key Finding: Dogma Is NEVER Used for the Decalogue
In all 5 NT occurrences, dogma refers to either:
1. Civil/governmental decrees (Luke 2:1; Acts 17:7)
2. Ecclesiastical decisions (Acts 16:4)
3. Ceremonial/regulatory ordinances (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14)

It is never used for the Ten Commandments or the moral law. The two "abolition" passages (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14) both use dogma for what was removed, specifying the referent as ordinances/decrees rather than the moral law.

## [G2673](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2673/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- katargeo (to render inoperative, abolish)
**Original:** καταργέω (katargeo)
**Transliteration:** katargeo
**Pronunciation:** kat-arg-eh'-o
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** From kata and argeo; to be (render) entirely idle (useless), literally or figuratively.
**Total NT occurrences:** 32 (27 BLB count)

### Key Translations
| Translation | Verses |
|-------------|--------|
| done away | 2 Cor 3:7, 11, 13 |
| abolished | Eph 2:15; 2 Cor 3:13 |
| make void | Rom 3:31 |
| destroyed | Rom 6:6; 1 Cor 6:13; 15:26 |
| delivered | Rom 7:2, 6 |
| of none effect | Rom 3:3; 4:14; Gal 3:17 |

### Usage in 2 Corinthians 3
- **2 Cor 3:7** -- "the ministration of death, written in stones...which [glory] was to be done away (katargoumenon)"
- **2 Cor 3:11** -- "if that which is done away (katargoumenon) [was] glorious"
- **2 Cor 3:13** -- "the end of that which is abolished (katargoumenou)"

**Grammar note:** In 2 Cor 3:7, the participle katargoumenon is neuter, agreeing with "glory" (doxa, feminine -- but functioning as a conceptual antecedent) or the "ministration" (diakonia, feminine). The standard grammatical reading is that what is "done away" is the GLORY (or the ministration of condemnation), not the law itself.

### Romans 3:31 -- The Counter-Statement
- **Rom 3:31** -- "Do we then MAKE VOID (katargoumen) the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we ESTABLISH the law."

Paul directly denies that faith katargeo-s the law. The same verb used for "abolish/done away" in 2 Cor 3 is explicitly denied application to the law in Rom 3:31.

## [H3772](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3772/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- karath (to cut [a covenant])
**Original:** karath
**Transliteration:** karath
**Pronunciation:** kaw-rath
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** A primitive root; to cut (off, down or asunder); by implication, to destroy or consume; specifically, to covenant (i.e. make an alliance or bargain, originally by cutting flesh and passing between the pieces).
**Total OT occurrences:** 358 (288 BLB count)

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| shall be cut off | 30 | 8.4% |
| made | 18 | 5.0% |
| and cut off | 12 | 3.4% |
| he made | 8 | 2.2% |
| cut off | 8 | 2.2% |

### Covenant-Making Usage
The primary relevance is the idiom "karath berith" (literally "cut a covenant"):
- **Jer 31:31** -- "I will MAKE (karath) a new covenant (berith)"
- **Jer 31:32** -- "the covenant that I MADE (karath) with their fathers"
- **Jer 31:33** -- "the covenant that I will MAKE (karath)"
- **Exo 34:27** -- "I have MADE (karath) a covenant with thee and with Israel"
- **Deu 5:2-3** -- "The LORD our God MADE (karath) a covenant with us in Horeb"
- **Gen 15:18** -- "the LORD MADE (karath) a covenant with Abram"

The verb karath links the new covenant (Jer 31:31-33) to the same covenant-making action used at Sinai, reinforcing that the new covenant is a re-establishment (different location, same content) rather than a wholly different entity.

## [H2710](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2710/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- chaqaq (to engrave, inscribe)
**Original:** chaqaq
**Transliteration:** chaqaq
**Pronunciation:** khaw-kak
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** A primitive root; properly, to hack, i.e. engrave (to be a scribe simply); by implication, to enact (laws being cut in stone or metal tablets in primitive times) or generally prescribe.
**Total OT occurrences:** 19

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| my lawgiver | 2 |
| the lawgiver | 1 |
| decree | 1 |
| the law | 1 |
| they were printed | 1 |
| note it | 1 |
| I have graven thee | 1 |

### Relevance to the Study
Chaqaq is the root behind choq (H2706) and chuqqah (H2708, "statutes"). Its etymological meaning -- "to engrave, inscribe" -- directly connects to the concept of law being inscribed on a physical medium. The definition notes that "laws [were] cut in stone or metal tablets in primitive times," directly paralleling the Decalogue's inscription on stone and the new covenant's inscription on hearts.

Key passages:
- **Isa 49:16** -- "I have GRAVEN (chaqaq) thee upon the palms of my hands" -- God inscribes His people on Himself
- **Isa 30:8** -- "NOTE (chaqaq) it in a book" -- inscribing for permanence
- **Job 19:23** -- "Oh that my words were now PRINTED (chaqaq)!" -- desire for permanent inscription
- **Psa 60:7/108:8** -- "Judah is MY LAWGIVER (chaqaq)" -- the inscriber/enactor of law

## [G1343](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1343/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- dikaiosyne (righteousness)
**Original:** dikaiosyne
**Transliteration:** dikaiosyne
**Pronunciation:** dik-ah-yos-oo-nay
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** From dikaios; equity (of character or act); specially (Christian) justification.
**Total NT occurrences:** 80 (92 BLB count)

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| righteousness | 42 | 52.5% |
| of righteousness | 18 | 22.5% |
| the righteousness | 9 | 11.2% |

### Relationship to dikaioma (G1345)
[G1343](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1343/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dikaiosyne) and [G1345](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1345/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dikaioma) are related but distinct:
- **dikaiosyne** = the quality/state of righteousness (abstract)
- **dikaioma** = the righteous requirement/deed (concrete)

In Romans, Paul uses both:
- **Rom 8:4** -- "the RIGHTEOUSNESS (dikaioma, G1345) of the law" = the law's concrete righteous requirement
- **Rom 8:10** -- "the Spirit is life because of RIGHTEOUSNESS (dikaiosyne, G1343)" = the state of righteousness
- **Rom 10:3-4** -- "God's RIGHTEOUSNESS (dikaiosyne)" vs. "their own RIGHTEOUSNESS (dikaiosyne)" -- righteousness as right standing
- **2 Cor 3:9** -- "the ministration of RIGHTEOUSNESS (dikaiosyne)" contrasted with "ministration of condemnation"

The distinction matters for Rom 8:4: Paul uses dikaioma (concrete requirement), not dikaiosyne (abstract quality), indicating a specific righteous standard of the law to be fulfilled.

## [G3548](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3548/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- nomothesia (legislation, law-giving)
**Original:** nomothesia
**Transliteration:** nomothesia
**Pronunciation:** nom-oth-es-ee-ah
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** From nomotheteo; legislation (specially, the institution of the Mosaic code).
**Total NT occurrences:** 1

### Single Occurrence
- **Rom 9:4** -- "Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the GIVING OF THE LAW (nomothesia), and the service of God, and the promises"

Paul lists the "giving of the law" as one of Israel's privileges alongside covenants, divine service, and promises. The term nomothesia (law-giving/legislation) encompasses the entire legislative event at Sinai. Its juxtaposition with "covenants" and "service" in the same list suggests these are distinct categories -- the law-giving itself is a privilege, alongside the covenantal relationship and the worship system.

### Relevance to the Study
The OT righteousness vocabulary connects to the law-on-hearts theme:
- **Deu 6:25** -- "it shall be our RIGHTEOUSNESS (tsedaqah), if we observe to do all these commandments"
- **Psa 119:142** -- "Thy RIGHTEOUSNESS (tsedaqah) is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth"
- **Isa 51:6-7** -- "my RIGHTEOUSNESS (tsedaqah) shall not be abolished...the people in whose heart is my law"

The last passage (Isa 51:7) is particularly significant: it explicitly links righteousness that "shall not be abolished" with "the people in whose heart is my law" -- directly connecting the OT righteousness vocabulary to the law-on-hearts concept.

## LXX Connections (Hebrew to Greek)

### Torah (H8451) in the LXX
The Hebrew torah is consistently translated as nomos (G3551) in the LXX. When the NT authors (especially in Hebrews) quote Jer 31:33 using nomos/nomous, they are rendering the Hebrew torah via the standard LXX translation equivalence.

### Kathab (H3789) in the NT
The concept of God "writing" (kathab) is rendered in the NT quotations with grapho/engrapho. In Heb 8:10: "I will put my laws into their mind, and write (epigrapso) them in their hearts." The epi- prefix on grapho intensifies the writing metaphor -- "inscribe upon."
