# Bible Study: What Specifically Is "My Law" Written on Hearts?

## Question

What specifically is "my law" (torati) that God promises to write on hearts in the new covenant? Investigate six angles:

1. **Jeremiah's use of torati (H8451 + 1cs suffix):** When Jeremiah 31:33 says "I will put MY law (torati) in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts," what does the possessive pronoun "my" identify? What does the verb katab (H3789, "write") connect to -- i.e., where else is this verb used for writing law, and what law was being written?

2. **The Sinai covenant terms in Deuteronomy 4:13:** "He declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone." How does the explicit identification of the covenant terms as the Decalogue connect to the new covenant promise to write "my law" on hearts?

3. **The Hebrews 10:1-16 structure:** This passage removes "sacrifice and offering" (vv.5-9) and then affirms "I will put my laws into their hearts" (vv.15-16). What is removed and what is established in the same argument? Does this passage distinguish between ceremonial and moral law?

4. **Ezekiel 36:27 -- statutes and judgments:** "I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in MY statutes (behuqqay), and ye shall keep MY judgments (mishpatay)." What are these statutes and judgments? Are they the same as the Decalogue, broader, or different?

5. **2 Corinthians 3:3 -- stone-to-heart contrast:** "Not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart." What was written on the stone tables (the Decalogue), and what does "fleshy tables of the heart" imply about the content being relocated?

6. **Romans 8:3-4 -- the righteousness of the law:** "That the righteousness (to dikaioma) of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." What is this "righteousness of the law" (dikaioma tou nomou) and how does the Spirit fulfill it?

**Key Findings from Prior Study Conclusions:**

**From law-01 (God's Moral Law):** The Decalogue is distinguished from all other legislation by seven unique markers: (1) spoken by God's own voice, (2) written by God's own finger, (3) engraved on stone, (4) placed inside the ark, (5) "he added no more," (6) called "the covenant," (7) called "the testimony." The attributes ascribed to this law (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal) are the same attributes ascribed to God Himself. Scope extends before Sinai, beyond Israel, into the new covenant, and to the end of time. **Tally: 46 Continues, 0 Abolished, 20 Neutral E-items.**

**From law-03 (Exodus 20 vs. Later Laws):** Five-dimensional textual distinction between Decalogue and subsequent legislation: (1) delivery mode (God's voice vs. through Moses), (2) authorship (God's finger vs. Moses' hand), (3) repository (inside ark vs. beside ark), (4) naming conventions ("the covenant"/"testimony" vs. "the book of the law"), (5) boundary marker ("he added no more"). Multi-author consistency across centuries.

**From law-08 (Abolished at the Cross):** Seven primary abolition passages examined. None explicitly names the Decalogue as abolished. Greek vocabulary specifies referents: cheirographon = "hand-written" (Decalogue was God-written); dogma used in Col 2:14 and Eph 2:15 but never for Decalogue; dikaiomata sarkos = carnal ordinances (meats, drinks, washings); katargoumenen (fem.) agrees with doxan (glory), not nomos (law). Heb 10:1-16 removes sacrifices while writing law on hearts.

**From law-09 (Old Covenant and New Covenant):** Old covenant terms = Ten Commandments (Deu 4:13; Exo 34:28). New covenant writes SAME law (torati/nomous mou) on hearts. Five differences between covenants: location (stone to hearts), power (human promise to God's action + Spirit), mediator (Moses to Christ), basis (animal blood to Christ's blood), forgiveness. NONE is a content change. The fault was with "them" (Heb 8:8, autous). **Tally: 25 Continues, 0 Abolished, 23 Neutral E-items.**

**From law-10 (New Covenant and Law):** Possessive pronouns "MY law" (torati), "MY laws" (nomous mou), "MY statutes/judgments" (huqqay/mishpatay) identify pre-existing law-content. New covenant establishes the moral law, not a replacement. Love defined as commandment-keeping (1 John 5:3; Rom 13:8-10). I-B items resolved: "not under the law" = freedom from condemnation (Strong toward Continues); Gal 3:19-25 = custodial function temporal (Strong toward Continues); Heb 8:13 = arrangement vanishing, not moral law (Strong toward Continues). **Tally: 22 Continues, 0 Abolished, 24 Neutral E-items.**

### Focus Areas

*Derived from tool discoveries and the six investigation angles:*

1. **Possessive pronoun chain:** Trace the possessive "my" through Jer 31:33 (torati), Heb 8:10 (nomous mou), Heb 10:16 (nomous mou), Eze 36:27 (huqqay, mishpatay), Eze 11:19-20 (huqqotay, mishpatay). Does the possessive pronoun in every new covenant passage point to the same pre-existing law?

2. **The kathab (H3789) connection:** The verb "write" (kathab) in Jer 31:33 is the same verb used for God writing the Decalogue on stone (Exo 31:18; 34:1; Deu 10:2, 4). Does this lexical link identify the content being written on hearts as the same content written on stone?

3. **Deu 4:13-14 as interpretive key:** Deu 4:13 identifies "his covenant" as "ten commandments" written on stone. The immediately following verse (4:14) separately mentions "statutes and judgments." Does this explicit identification govern how we read "my law" in Jer 31:33?

4. **Hebrews 10:1-17 dual operation:** This passage removes sacrifices (vv.1-9, 18) and affirms law on hearts (vv.15-17) within one argument. Does this structure itself distinguish ceremonial from moral law?

5. **Ezekiel 36:27 vocabulary:** The terms "statutes" (chuqqot, H2708) and "judgments" (mishpatim, H4941) are broader than the Decalogue alone. Does Eze 36:27 point to something broader than the Ten Commandments, and if so, what is the relationship?

6. **2 Cor 3:3 stone-to-heart:** The explicit mention of "tables of stone" (the Decalogue's medium) and "fleshy tables of the heart" (the new covenant medium). Does this passage teach that the SAME content (Decalogue) is being relocated from stone to heart?

7. **Rom 8:3-4 dikaioma:** What is "the righteousness of the law" (to dikaioma tou nomou)? How does the Spirit fulfill it? Does this connect to the law-on-hearts promise?

8. **Counter-arguments:** Examine whether Gal 3:19-25, 2 Cor 3:7-11, Heb 8:13, or Gal 4:24 provide evidence that the law written on hearts is something other than the Decalogue. Apply I-B resolution protocol from the methodology.
