**Original:** שַׁבָּת
**Transliteration:** shabbath
**Pronunciation:** shab-bawth
**Part of Speech:** masculine/feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 108
**Total Occurrences (with variants):** 109

**Definition:** Intensive from [H7673](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7673/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (shabath); intermission, i.e. (specifically) the Sabbath: (every) sabbath.

### Key Verses in Leviticus 23
- **Lev 23:3** (2x): "the sabbath of rest (*shabbath shabbathon*)" and "the sabbath of the LORD (*shabbat hi laYHWH*)"
- **Lev 23:11**: "on the morrow after the sabbath"
- **Lev 23:15** (3x): "from the morrow after the sabbath... seven sabbaths shall be complete"
- **Lev 23:16**: "after the seventh sabbath"
- **Lev 23:32** (2x): "a sabbath of rest (*shabbath shabbathon*)" and "ye shall celebrate your sabbath"
- **Lev 23:38** (2x): "the sabbaths of the LORD (*shabbetot YHWH*)" -- plural feminine construct form

### Distribution Pattern
The word *shabbath* is used in Lev 23 for:
1. The weekly Sabbath (v.3) -- *shabbath shabbathon*, *shabbat hi laYHWH*
2. The Day of Atonement (v.32) -- *shabbath shabbathon*
3. The "sabbaths of the LORD" in the summary (v.38) -- *shabbetot YHWH*
4. Counting contexts for Pentecost (v.11, 15, 16) -- using *shabbath* to count weeks

It is NOT used for Trumpets (v.24 uses *shabbathon* alone), Tabernacles first/eighth days (v.39 uses *shabbathon* alone), or the other feast days.

## [H7677](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7677/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- shabbathon (שַׁבָּתוֹן) -- "sabbatism/rest"

**Original:** שַׁבָּתוֹן
**Transliteration:** shabbathon
**Pronunciation:** shab-baw-thone
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 11

**Definition:** From [H7676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7676/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (shabbath); a sabbatism or special holiday: rest, sabbath.

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| of rest | 7 | 63.6% |
| a sabbath | 3 | 27.3% |
| the rest | 1 | 9.1% |

### All 11 Occurrences
| Reference | Context | Paired with shabbath? |
|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| Exo 16:23 | "the rest of the holy sabbath" | YES -- *shabbathon shabbath-qodesh* |
| Exo 31:15 | "the seventh is the sabbath of rest" | YES -- *shabbath shabbathon* |
| Exo 35:2 | "the seventh day... a sabbath of rest" | YES -- *shabbath shabbathon* |
| **Lev 16:31** | Day of Atonement: "a sabbath of rest" | YES -- *shabbath shabbathon* |
| **Lev 23:3** | Weekly Sabbath: "the sabbath of rest" | YES -- *shabbath shabbathon* |
| **Lev 23:24** | Feast of Trumpets: "a sabbath (*shabbathon*)" | **NO** -- stands alone |
| **Lev 23:32** | Day of Atonement: "a sabbath of rest" | YES -- *shabbath shabbathon* |
| **Lev 23:39a** | Tabernacles first day: "a sabbath (*shabbathon*)" | **NO** -- stands alone |
| **Lev 23:39b** | Tabernacles eighth day: "a sabbath (*shabbathon*)" | **NO** -- stands alone |
| **Lev 25:4** | Sabbatical year: "a sabbath of rest" | YES -- *shabbath shabbathon* |
| **Lev 25:5** | Sabbatical year: "a year of rest" | NO -- *shabbathon* alone (the land) |

### Critical Distribution Pattern
When *shabbathon* is paired with *shabbath* (as *shabbath shabbathon*), it describes:
- The **weekly Sabbath** (Exo 16:23; 31:15; 35:2; Lev 23:3)
- The **Day of Atonement** (Lev 16:31; 23:32)
- The **sabbatical year** (Lev 25:4)

When *shabbathon* stands ALONE (without *shabbath*), it describes:
- **Feast of Trumpets** (Lev 23:24)
- **Tabernacles** first and eighth days (Lev 23:39)
- **Sabbatical year** (Lev 25:5 -- for the land, not people)

This vocabulary distribution distinguishes between the full "sabbath of rest" (weekly Sabbath character) and the lesser "sabbatical rest" (feast-day character).

## [H7673](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7673/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- shabath (שָׁבַת) -- verb: "to cease/rest"

**Original:** שָׁבַת
**Transliteration:** shabath
**Pronunciation:** shaw-bath
**Part of Speech:** verb
**BLB Count:** 71 (110 total with variants)

**Definition:** A primitive root; to repose, i.e. desist from exertion; used in many implied relations (causative, figurative or specific): (cause to, let, make to) cease, celebrate, cause (make) to fail, keep (sabbath), suffer to be lacking, leave, put away (down), (make to) rest, rid, still, take away.

### Key Occurrences
- **Gen 2:2** -- *vayyishbot* (Qal wayyiqtol 3ms): "and he rested [ceased]" -- God's action on the seventh day
- **Gen 2:3** -- *shabat* (Qal perfect 3ms): "he had rested [ceased]" -- explanatory clause
- **Exo 16:30** -- "So the people rested (*shabat*) on the seventh day"
- **Exo 31:17** -- "on the seventh day he rested (*shabat*) and was refreshed"
- **Lev 23:32** -- *tishbetu* (Qal imperfect 2mp): "ye shall celebrate [keep sabbath]" -- the verb used for the Day of Atonement
- **Lev 25:2** -- "then shall the land keep a sabbath (*tishabot*) unto the LORD"
- **Lev 26:34-35** -- the land "resting" (*tishabot*) its sabbaths in exile

### Significance
The verb *shabath* is the ROOT of both the noun *shabbath* (H7676) and *shabbathon* (H7677). Its first occurrence at creation (Gen 2:2) establishes the sabbath concept before any ceremonial system exists. The progression is: verb at creation > noun in Exodus 16 > commandment in Exodus 20 > ceremonial application in Leviticus 23.

## [H4150](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4150/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- moed (מוֹעֵד) -- "appointed time/feast/congregation"

**Original:** מוֹעֵד
**Transliteration:** moed
**Pronunciation:** mo-ade
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 223 (229 total with variants)

**Definition:** From [H3259](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3259/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (yaad, "to appoint"); properly, an appointment, i.e. a fixed time or season; specifically, a festival; conventionally a year; by implication, an assembly (as convened for a definite purpose); technically the congregation; by extension, the place of meeting; also a signal (as appointed beforehand).

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| of the congregation | 146 | 63.8% |
| the feasts | 4 | 1.7% |
| appointed (various) | ~15 | 6.5% |
| solemn feasts/assembly | ~8 | 3.5% |
| season(s) | ~5 | 2.2% |
| (other variants) | ~51 | 22.3% |

### Key Occurrences
- **Gen 1:14** -- *moadim*: "seasons" -- the luminaries are for *moadim* (appointed times), tied to celestial cycles
- **Lev 23:2** -- *moadei YHWH*: "the feasts of the LORD" -- introduces the feast calendar
- **Lev 23:4** -- *moadei YHWH*: "the feasts of the LORD" -- RESTARTS the feast list after v.3 (weekly Sabbath)
- **Lev 23:37** -- *moadei YHWH*: "the feasts of the LORD" -- summary of feasts v.4-36
- **Lev 23:44** -- *moadei YHWH*: "the feasts of the LORD" -- chapter closing
- **Num 29:39** -- *bamoadeikem*: "in your set feasts" -- closing summary of Numbers 28-29

### Significance
*Moed* is the technical term for "appointed feast" in the ceremonial calendar. It is NEVER used as a synonym for *shabbath* in referring to the weekly Sabbath. In Lev 23, the *moadim* are the annual appointments (v.4-36), while the weekly *shabbath* (v.3) is treated as a separate institution. The same word appears in Gen 1:14 for the "seasons" governed by the luminaries -- connecting the annual festivals to the astronomical/lunar calendar, while the weekly sabbath remains independent.

## [H2282](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2282/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- chag (חַג) -- "feast/festival"

**Original:** חַג
**Transliteration:** chag
**Pronunciation:** khag
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 62 (69 with variants)

**Definition:** From [H2287](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2287/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (chagag, "to celebrate"); a festival, or a victim therefor: (solemn) feast (day), sacrifice, solemnity.

### Key Occurrences
- **Exo 23:14** -- "Three times thou shalt keep a feast (*chag*) unto me in the year" -- the three pilgrimage feasts
- **Lev 23:6** -- "the feast (*chag*) of unleavened bread"
- **Lev 23:34** -- "the feast (*chag*) of tabernacles"
- **Lev 23:39** -- "ye shall keep a feast (*chag*) unto the LORD"
- **Lev 23:41** -- "ye shall keep it a feast (*chag*) unto the LORD"

### Significance
*Chag* is distinct from *moed*. While *moed* means "appointed time" (broader), *chag* specifically means "festival" -- a celebration with pilgrim character. It is used exclusively for the annual festivals, NEVER for the weekly Sabbath. The weekly Sabbath is never called a *chag*.

## [H905](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h905/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- bad (בַּד) / millibad (מִלְּבַד) -- "apart from/beside"

**Original:** בַּד
**Transliteration:** bad
**Pronunciation:** bad
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 56 (203 total with compound forms)

**Definition:** From [H909](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h909/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (badad); properly, separation; by implication, a part of the body, branch of a tree, bar for carrying; figuratively, chief of a city; especially (with prepositional prefix) as an adverb, apart, only, besides.

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| beside | 33 | 16.3% |
| alone | 32 | 15.8% |
| only | 30 | 14.8% |
| apart | 11 | 5.4% |
| besides | 1 | 0.5% |

### Critical Usage in Leviticus 23:38
The compound form *millibad* (from + to + separation = "apart from, beside, in addition to") appears FOUR times in Lev 23:38:
1. **millibad shabbetot YHWH** -- "beside the sabbaths of the LORD"
2. **umillibad mattnoteikem** -- "and beside your gifts"
3. **umillibad kol-nidreichem** -- "and beside all your vows"
4. **umillibad kol-nidboteikem** -- "and beside all your freewill offerings"

This four-fold *millibad* structure places the weekly sabbaths, gifts, vows, and freewill offerings all in a SEPARATE category from the feast system (*moadim*) summarized in v.37. The sabbaths of the LORD are not part of the feast calendar -- they are "beside" (separate from, in addition to) it.

### Also in Numbers 29:39
"These things ye shall do... in your set feasts (*moadim*), beside (*millibad*) your vows, and your freewill offerings" -- the same structural separation.

## [G4521](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4521/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- sabbaton (σάββατον) -- Greek "Sabbath"

**Original:** σάββατον
**Transliteration:** sabbaton
**Pronunciation:** sab-bat-on
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun
**BLB Count:** 68 (55 in some counts)

**Definition:** Of Hebrew origin (H7676); the Sabbath (i.e. Shabbath), or day of weekly repose from secular avocations.

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| sabbath | 19 | 34.5% |
| sabbath day | 13 | 23.6% |
| sabbath days | 7 | 12.7% |
| of the week | 4 | 7.3% |
| week | 3 | 5.5% |
| the sabbath day | 3 | 5.5% |

### Key Occurrence: Colossians 2:16
**σαββάτων** (*sabbaton*, genitive plural neuter) -- "of sabbaths" or "sabbath days"

**Greek parsing of Col 2:16:**
| Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing |

The triad is: feast (*heorte*) / new moon (*neomenia*) / sabbaths (*sabbata*). This descending sequence (annual > monthly > ?) parallels the OT ceremonial triad. The plural "sabbaths" in the context of the ceremonial triad points to the ceremonial feast sabbaths rather than the singular weekly Sabbath.

## [G4520](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4520/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- sabbatismos (σαββατισμός) -- "Sabbath-keeping"

**Original:** σαββατισμός
**Transliteration:** sabbatismos
**Pronunciation:** sab-bat-is-mos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 1 (hapax legomenon)

**Definition:** From a derivative of [G4521](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4521/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; a "sabbatism," i.e. (figuratively) the repose of Christianity (as a type of heaven).

### The Single Occurrence: Hebrews 4:9
> "There remaineth therefore a **rest** (*sabbatismos*) to the people of God."

### Significance
This is the ONLY occurrence of *sabbatismos* in the NT. It is distinct from *katapausis* (G2663, "rest" used in Heb 4:1,3,5,8,10,11). The author deliberately switches from *katapausis* to *sabbatismos* in v.9, indicating something specific: not just "rest" in general, but a "Sabbath-keeping" or "sabbath-observance" remains for God's people. The context links this back to the creation Sabbath (v.4 cites Gen 2:2).

## [H4744](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4744/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- miqra (מִקְרָא) -- "holy convocation"

**Original:** מִקְרָא
**Transliteration:** miqra
**Pronunciation:** mik-raw
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 23 (39 with variants)

**Definition:** From [H7121](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7121/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (qara, "to call"); something called out, i.e. a public meeting (the act, the persons, or the place); also a rehearsal: assembly, calling, convocation, reading.

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| convocation | 16 | 41.0% |
| an (holy) | 16 | 41.0% |
| assemblies | ~2 | 5.0% |

### Key Occurrences in Leviticus 23
- v.2: "holy convocations (*miqra'ei qodesh*)" -- general designation for all
- v.3: "an holy convocation (*miqra-qodesh*)" -- the weekly Sabbath
- v.4: "holy convocations (*miqra'ei qodesh*)" -- the annual feasts
- v.7, 8, 21, 24, 27, 35, 36: "an holy convocation" -- individual feast days
- v.37: "holy convocations (*miqra'ei qodesh*)" -- summary

### Significance
*Miqra qodesh* is used for BOTH the weekly Sabbath (v.3) and the annual feast days (v.4ff). This shared vocabulary shows they share the character of "holy convocation" -- but other vocabulary distinguishes them. The shared term shows overlap in sacred character; the distinctive vocabulary (*shabbath* vs *moed*, *millibad* separation) shows institutional separation.

## [H6944](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6944/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- qodesh (קֹדֶשׁ) -- "holy/set apart"

**Original:** קֹדֶשׁ
**Transliteration:** qodesh
**Pronunciation:** ko-desh
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 468 (452 with variants)

**Definition:** From [H6942](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6942/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (qadash); a sacred place or thing; rarely abstract, sanctity: consecrated (thing), dedicated (thing), hallowed (thing), holiness, (most) holy (day, portion, thing), saint, sanctuary.

### Key Occurrences
- **Gen 2:3** -- God "sanctified" (*qadash*, the verb form) the seventh day
- **Exo 16:23** -- "the rest of the holy (*qodesh*) sabbath unto the LORD"
- **Exo 20:8** -- "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy (*qadash*)"
- **Lev 23:3** -- "*miqra-qodesh*" (holy convocation)
- **Neh 9:14** -- "thy HOLY (*qodesh*) sabbath"

### Significance
The Sabbath is characterized by *qodesh* (holiness) from its very inception at creation (Gen 2:3). This holiness is intrinsic to the day, not derived from the ceremonial system. The ceremonial feast days are also called "holy convocations," but the Sabbath's holiness predates and is independent of the ceremonial calendar.

## [H7637](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7637/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- shbi'i (שְׁבִיעִי) -- "seventh"

**Original:** שְׁבִיעִי
**Transliteration:** shbi'i
**Pronunciation:** sheb-ee-ee
**Part of Speech:** adjective
**BLB Count:** 98

**Definition:** Ordinal from [H7651](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7651/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (sheba, "seven"); seventh (time).

### Key Occurrences
- **Gen 2:2-3**: "the seventh day" (3x) -- creation
- **Exo 20:10**: "the seventh day is the sabbath"
- **Lev 23:3**: "the seventh day" -- weekly Sabbath
- **Lev 23:16**: "the seventh sabbath" -- counting to Pentecost
- **Lev 23:24, 27, 34, 39, 41**: "the seventh month" -- fall feasts

### Significance
The "seventh" connects the weekly Sabbath to the creation week (Gen 2:2-3) and the sabbatical year (Lev 25:4). The number seven is foundational to both the weekly and agricultural sabbath cycles but is also used for the seventh month (when most annual feasts occur). The connection to creation is primary for the weekly Sabbath.

## [H7620](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7620/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- shabua (שָׁבוּעַ) -- "week/seven"

**Original:** שָׁבוּעַ
**Transliteration:** shabua
**Pronunciation:** shaw-boo-ah
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 20

**Definition:** Passive participle of [H7650](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7650/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} as a denominative of [H7651](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7651/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; literally, sevened, i.e. a week (specifically, of years): seven, week.

### Key Occurrences
- **Exo 34:22**: "the feast of weeks (*shavuot*)" -- Pentecost
- **Lev 12:5**: "two weeks"
- **Num 28:26**: "after your weeks be out" -- Pentecost
- **Deu 16:9-10**: "seven weeks... the feast of weeks (*shavuot*)"
- **Dan 9:24-27**: "seventy weeks (*shavuim*)" -- prophetic

### Significance
The root is shared with *shabbath* and *shabath*. The "Feast of Weeks" (*shavuot*, Pentecost) is literally "the Feast of Sevens" -- its very name connects it to the sabbath counting cycle (Lev 23:15-16). The word demonstrates the pervasive influence of the sabbatical/seven principle in Israelite calendar reckoning.

## [H4868](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4868/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- mishbath (מִשְׁבָּת) -- "cessation/destruction"

**Original:** מִשְׁבָּת
**Transliteration:** mishbath
**Pronunciation:** mish-bawth
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 1 (hapax legomenon)

**Definition:** From [H7673](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7673/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (shabath); cessation, i.e. destruction: sabbath.

### The Single Occurrence: Lamentations 1:7

KJV translates as "her sabbaths" in Lam 1:7 (some MSS), though this is a rare sabbath-related noun meaning "cessation" -- describing Jerusalem's desolation as the cessation of her former glory.

### Significance
This rare noun shows the semantic range of the *shabath* root extends to "cessation/destruction" -- the most extreme form of "ceasing." It is only tangentially related to the weekly Sabbath institution.
