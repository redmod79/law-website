# CONCLUSION: Weekly Sabbath vs Ceremonial Sabbaths (law-24)

## Study Question
Does the Bible itself distinguish the weekly Sabbath from the annual ceremonial sabbaths?

## Summary Answer
The Bible itself distinguishes the weekly Sabbath from the annual ceremonial sabbaths through multiple converging lines of textual evidence: structural separation in Leviticus 23 (the weekly Sabbath stated in v.3 before the annual feasts restart at v.4), explicit vocabulary separation in Leviticus 23:37-38 (the feasts are "beside the sabbaths of the LORD"), two distinct levels of work prohibition (kol-melakhah, "all work," for the weekly Sabbath vs. melekhet abodah, "servile work," for the feast days), and a distinct offering category in Numbers 28-29. The weekly Sabbath alone is grounded in creation (Genesis 2:2-3; Exodus 20:8-11), is never called a moed (appointed feast) or chag (pilgrimage feast), is observed "in all your dwellings" rather than at a central sanctuary, and is presented as continuing into the new earth (Isaiah 66:23) -- none of which applies to the ceremonial sabbaths. The Colossians 2:16 "sabbath days" most naturally refers to the ceremonial feast sabbaths (the same triad of feast/new moon/sabbath that appears in 2 Chronicles 31:3, Ezekiel 45:17, and Hosea 2:11), not the weekly seventh-day Sabbath of the Decalogue.

## Key Verses

**Leviticus 23:3** -- "Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day [is] the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work [therein]: it [is] the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings."

**Leviticus 23:37-38** -- "These [are] the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim [to be] holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day: Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD."

**Genesis 2:2-3** -- "And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."

**Exodus 20:8-11** -- "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of the LORD thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is] within thy gates: For [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them [is], and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."

**Numbers 28:9-10** -- "And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour [for] a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof: [This is] the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering."

**Isaiah 66:22-23** -- "For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, [that] from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD."

**Colossians 2:16-17** -- "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath [days]: Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body [is] of Christ."

**2 Chronicles 31:3** -- "[He appointed] also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, [to wit], for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as [it is] written in the law of the LORD."

## 1. Explicit Statements Table

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Position |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | The weekly Sabbath is stated in Lev 23:3 as "the sabbath of rest (shabbath shabbathon), an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings." | Lev 23:3 | Neutral |
| E2 | Lev 23:4 restarts the feast list with "These are the feasts (moadim) of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons" -- the same introductory formula as v.2, applied now to the annual feasts beginning at v.5. | Lev 23:4 | Neutral |
| E3 | Lev 23:37 summarizes: "These are the feasts (moadim) of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day." | Lev 23:37 | Neutral |
| E4 | Lev 23:38 states: "Beside (millibad) the sabbaths of the LORD (shabbetot YHWH), and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD." The fourfold millibad places the weekly sabbaths, gifts, vows, and freewill offerings as categories separate from the feasts summarized in v.37. | Lev 23:37-38 | Continues |
| E5 | The Feast of Trumpets (Lev 23:24) uses shabbathon alone: "a sabbath (shabbathon), a memorial of blowing of trumpets." The word shabbath is not used. | Lev 23:24 | Neutral |
| E6 | The Day of Atonement (Lev 23:32) uses shabbath shabbathon: "a sabbath of rest (shabbath shabbathon)... ye shall celebrate your sabbath (tishbetu shabbattekem)." This is the same vocabulary as the weekly Sabbath in v.3. | Lev 23:32 | Neutral |
| E7 | The first and eighth days of Tabernacles (Lev 23:39) use shabbathon alone: "on the first day shall be a sabbath (shabbathon), and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath (shabbathon)." The word shabbath is not used. | Lev 23:39 | Neutral |
| E8 | The weekly Sabbath (Lev 23:3) prohibits "all work" (kol-melakhah lo ta'asu). The feast days (Lev 23:7, 8, 21, 25, 35, 36) prohibit "servile work" (melekhet abodah lo ta'asu). The Day of Atonement (Lev 23:28, 31) prohibits "all work" (kol-melakhah lo ta'asu), matching the weekly Sabbath. | Lev 23:3, 7, 8, 21, 25, 28, 31, 35, 36 | Continues |
| E9 | Numbers 28-29 organizes offerings in this order: daily (28:1-8), Sabbath (28:9-10), new moon (28:11-15), then annual feasts (28:16-29:38). The Sabbath has its own offering category between the daily and monthly offerings, separate from the annual feast offerings. | Num 28:9-10 | Continues |
| E10 | Num 28:10 states: "This is the burnt offering of every sabbath (shabbat beshabbatto), beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering." The phrase "every sabbath" confirms a weekly cycle. | Num 28:9-10 | Neutral |
| E11 | Gen 1:14 states the luminaries are "for signs (otot), and for seasons (moadim), and for days (yamim), and years (shanim)." The weekly sabbath is not listed among the functions of the luminaries. | Gen 1:14 | Neutral |
| E12 | The luminaries were created on Day 4 of creation (Gen 1:14-19). The weekly sabbath was established on Day 7 (Gen 2:2-3). | Gen 1:14-19; Gen 2:2-3 | Neutral |
| E13 | Gen 2:2-3 states God rested (vayyishbot, from shabath H7673), blessed, and sanctified the seventh day. Three divine acts on the seventh day at creation, before any ceremonial system existed. | Gen 2:2-3 | Neutral |
| E14 | The fourth commandment (Exo 20:8-11) grounds the Sabbath in creation: "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth... and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it." | Exo 20:8-11 | Continues |
| E15 | The Sabbath in Lev 23:3 is "in all your dwellings (bekhol moshboteikhem)." The annual feasts are tied to specific calendar dates and the central sanctuary. The phrase "in all your dwellings" is not used for any of the annual feast days in Lev 23. | Lev 23:3 | Neutral |
| E16 | The annual feasts in Lev 23 are tied to calendar dates: "In the fourteenth day of the first month" (v.5), "In the seventh month, in the first day of the month" (v.24), "on the tenth day of this seventh month" (v.27), "The fifteenth day of this seventh month" (v.34). The weekly Sabbath (v.3) has no calendar date -- it is "the seventh day" in a continuous cycle. | Lev 23:3, 5, 24, 27, 34 | Neutral |
| E17 | The sabbatical year (Lev 25:4) uses the same vocabulary as the weekly Sabbath: "a sabbath of rest (shabbath shabbathon) unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD (shabbat laYHWH)." | Lev 25:4 | Neutral |
| E18 | The OT lists "feasts/new moons/sabbaths" as a ceremonial triad: 2 Chr 31:3 ("sabbaths, new moons, set feasts"), Eze 45:17 ("feasts, new moons, sabbaths"), Hos 2:11 ("feast days, new moons, sabbaths"). | 2 Chr 31:3; Eze 45:17; Hos 2:11 | Neutral |
| E19 | Col 2:16-17 states: "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday (heortes), or of the new moon (neomenias), or of the sabbath days (sabbaton): which are a shadow of things to come." | Col 2:16-17 | Neutral |
| E20 | Isa 66:22-23 states: "From one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD." Two distinct cycles (monthly and weekly) continue in the new earth. | Isa 66:22-23 | Continues |
| E21 | Eze 20:12 states: "Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them." God calls the sabbaths "my sabbaths" and designates them as "a sign." | Eze 20:12 | Neutral |
| E22 | Neh 9:13-14 states: "Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven... and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses." The Sabbath is "thy holy sabbath" (singular, specific). | Neh 9:13-14 | Neutral |
| E23 | The weekly Sabbath is never called a moed (appointed feast) in Lev 23 or anywhere else. The word moed is used in Lev 23:2, 4, 37, 44 for the annual feasts. | Lev 23 | Neutral |
| E24 | The weekly Sabbath is never called a chag (festival/pilgrimage feast). The word chag is used for Unleavened Bread (Lev 23:6), Tabernacles (Lev 23:34, 39, 41), and the three pilgrimage feasts (Exo 23:14-17). | Lev 23; Exo 23:14-17 | Neutral |
| E25 | Exo 16:23-30 records the manna cycle: "Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none" (v.26). This continuous 6+1 cycle was enforced for forty years in the wilderness. | Exo 16:23-30 | Neutral |

### Positional Classification Notes for E-Items

**E4 (Continues):** The text explicitly places "the sabbaths of the LORD" as "beside" (separate from) the feasts. This is a textual distinction between weekly sabbaths and annual feasts. Gate 1 (Referent): The referent "sabbaths of the LORD" is identified by v.38's own context as the weekly sabbaths, since the feasts (which include their own rest days) are the subject of v.37. Gate 2 (Grammar): millibad unambiguously means "apart from/beside." Gate 3 (Genre): Didactic legal prose. Gate 4 (Harmony): Consistent with E8, E9, and the vocabulary distribution. Classification stands: Continues (the text distinguishes weekly sabbaths from ceremonial feast sabbaths).

**E8 (Continues):** The text uses two different levels of work prohibition, distinguishing the weekly Sabbath from most feast days. This vocabulary distinction is observable in the Hebrew text. Gate 1: The subject is identifiable -- "all work" vs "servile work." Gate 2: The Hebrew grammar is unambiguous. Gate 3: Legal prose. Gate 4: Consistent with E4, E5, E7. Classification stands: Continues (evidence of a biblical distinction between the weekly Sabbath and feast-day rests).

**E9 (Continues):** Numbers 28-29 places the Sabbath in its own offering category, structurally separate from the annual feasts. Gate 1: The Sabbath offering (28:9-10) is clearly identified as weekly. Gate 2: The organizational structure is unambiguous. Gate 3: Legal prose. Gate 4: Consistent with E4, E8. Classification stands: Continues (the text treats the Sabbath as a distinct category from the annual feasts).

**E14 (Continues):** The fourth commandment grounds the Sabbath in creation, not in the ceremonial system. Gate 1: The Sabbath is the specific referent. Gate 2: Grammar unambiguous. Gate 3: Didactic legal. Gate 4: Consistent with E13 (creation origin). Classification stands: Continues (the Decalogue Sabbath is grounded in creation, distinct from ceremonial appointments).

**E20 (Continues):** Isaiah prophesies the weekly Sabbath continuing in the new earth. Gate 1: "Sabbath" (weekly cycle) is distinguished from "new moon" (monthly cycle). Gate 2: Grammar unambiguous. Gate 3: Direct-speech prophecy ("saith the LORD"). Gate 4: Consistent with other E-items affirming the Sabbath's ongoing status. Classification stands: Continues.

**Neutral E-items:** E1-E3, E5-E7, E10-E13, E15-E19, E21-E25 are classified Neutral because they state observable textual facts that both sides acknowledge, or concern vocabulary/structure without directly bearing on whether the moral law (Decalogue/Sabbath) continues or was abolished.

## 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | Leviticus 23 presents the weekly Sabbath (v.3) and the annual feasts (v.4-36) as structurally separate sections, with v.4 restarting the feast list after the weekly Sabbath is stated. | E1, E2, E3 | Both v.2 and v.4 use the identical formula "these are the feasts of the LORD." v.4's repetition of this formula after v.3 marks a new beginning. The summary in v.37 refers back to v.4-36, not v.3. Any reader can observe this structural arrangement. |
| N2 | Leviticus 23:37-38 places the "sabbaths of the LORD" in a category SEPARATE FROM the annual feasts (moadim). | E3, E4 | v.37 summarizes the feasts. v.38 says these feasts are "beside" (millibad) four items, the first being "the sabbaths of the LORD." The preposition millibad means "apart from/beside." This is what the text says; no reader can deny that millibad creates a separation. |
| N3 | The Hebrew text uses two distinct vocabulary levels for sabbath-rest in Leviticus 23: shabbath shabbathon (for the weekly Sabbath and Day of Atonement) and shabbathon alone (for Trumpets and Tabernacles rest days). | E1, E5, E6, E7 | The parsing data shows shabbath shabbathon in v.3 and v.32, and shabbathon alone in v.24 and v.39. This is an observable grammatical fact in the Hebrew text. |
| N4 | The Hebrew text uses two distinct levels of work prohibition in Leviticus 23: "all work" (kol-melakhah) for the weekly Sabbath and Day of Atonement, and "servile work" (melekhet abodah) for the other feast days. | E8 | The Hebrew phrases are different: kol-melakhah in v.3, 28, 31 vs melekhet abodah in v.7, 8, 21, 25, 35, 36. Any reader of the Hebrew text can observe this difference. |
| N5 | Numbers 28-29 treats the Sabbath offering as a distinct temporal category (weekly), separate from both the daily offerings and the annual feast offerings. | E9, E10 | The organizational structure is: daily (28:1-8) > weekly Sabbath (28:9-10) > monthly new moon (28:11-15) > annual feasts (28:16-29:38). The Sabbath occupies its own section. Any reader can observe this arrangement. |
| N6 | The moadim (appointed times) of Genesis 1:14 are tied to the celestial luminaries; the weekly sabbath is not listed among the functions of the luminaries and was established three days after the luminaries were created. | E11, E12 | Gen 1:14 lists four functions: signs, moadim, days, years. The weekly sabbath is absent from this list. The luminaries (Day 4) precede the sabbath (Day 7) by three days. These are observable facts in the creation narrative. |
| N7 | The vocabulary pattern in Leviticus 23 aligns: days with shabbath shabbathon have the "all work" prohibition; days with shabbathon alone have the "servile work" prohibition. | N3, N4, E8 | Mapping the vocabulary to the work level: v.3 (shabbath shabbathon + kol-melakhah), v.32 (shabbath shabbathon + kol-melakhah), v.24 (shabbathon + melekhet abodah), v.39 (shabbathon + melekhet abodah). The correlation is complete and observable. |
| N8 | The weekly Sabbath is never designated by the terms moed or chag in Leviticus 23 or elsewhere in the Pentateuch. The annual feasts are designated by both moed and (for the pilgrimage feasts) chag. | E23, E24 | Verifiable by word search: moed and chag are used for annual feasts but not for the weekly Sabbath. Any reader can confirm this absence. |

### Positional Classification of N-Items

**N1 (Neutral):** Both sides can observe the structural arrangement. Whether v.2 "includes" the weekly Sabbath in the moadim category or merely introduces the chapter's topic is a matter of interpretation -- but the structural fact that v.4 restarts the formula is observable by all.

**N2 (Continues):** This follows unavoidably from E3+E4. The text says the feasts are "beside" the sabbaths of the LORD. This is a textual distinction between feast sabbaths and weekly sabbaths. The Abolished position would need to argue that millibad does not mean separation -- but the fourfold repetition and the parallel in Num 29:39 confirm the separating function. This supports the Continues position because it is evidence that the Bible itself distinguishes the weekly Sabbath from the ceremonial sabbaths.

**N3, N4, N7 (Neutral):** These are observable vocabulary facts. Both sides must acknowledge the different Hebrew words are used. The SIGNIFICANCE of the difference is a matter of interpretation (inference level), but the FACT of the difference is a necessary implication of the explicit statements.

**N5 (Continues):** The organizational structure of Numbers 28-29 treats the Sabbath as a distinct category. This is evidence that the Bible itself distinguishes the weekly Sabbath from the annual feast system -- supporting the Continues position's claim that the Bible makes such distinctions.

**N6 (Neutral):** The absence of the weekly sabbath from Gen 1:14's list is observable. Its significance is debated.

**N8 (Neutral):** An observable vocabulary fact.

## 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that the weekly Sabbath is categorically distinct from the ceremonial feast sabbaths -- it is a moral-law institution rooted in creation, not a ceremonial appointment tied to the Mosaic system. | I-A | E4 (Lev 23:37-38: feasts "beside" the sabbaths of the LORD); E8 (two levels of work prohibition); E9 (Num 28-29 separate category); E13-E14 (creation origin, fourth commandment grounds in creation); N2 (millibad separation); N3-N4 (vocabulary distinctions); N5 (Numbers offering structure); N7 (vocabulary-work alignment); N8 (never called moed or chag). All these E/N items use vocabulary and concepts found in the text. | Systematizes multiple textual distinctions (structural, vocabulary, organizational, origin) into a single categorical claim. Each component is in the E/N tables, but the comprehensive claim "categorically distinct" requires combining all of them. | #5 (systematizing) |
| I2 | The "sabbath days" (sabbaton) in Colossians 2:16 refers to the annual ceremonial sabbaths of the feast system, not the weekly seventh-day Sabbath of the Decalogue. | I-B | FOR: E4 (Lev 23:38 distinguishes weekly sabbaths from feasts); E18 (OT ceremonial triad: feasts/new moons/sabbaths); E19 (Col 2:16 uses the same triad); N2 (millibad separation). AGAINST: E19 (Col 2:16 uses sabbaton, which CAN refer to the weekly Sabbath elsewhere in the NT); the plural sabbaton is used for the weekly Sabbath in other NT passages (e.g., Mat 12:1). | Requires identifying the referent of sabbaton in Col 2:16. The word sabbaton has a semantic range that includes both the weekly Sabbath and ceremonial sabbath days. The triad pattern (feast/new moon/sabbath) matches the OT ceremonial formula, but sabbaton itself is ambiguous. | #2 (choosing between readings), #4b (cross-referencing OT triad to Col 2:16) |
| I3 | The Bible teaches that ALL sabbaths (including the weekly Sabbath) are part of one unified ceremonial system, all of which were abolished at the cross. | I-D | The text of Lev 23:2 uses moadim before stating the weekly Sabbath in v.3, which could be read as including the weekly Sabbath among the moadim. Col 2:16-17 mentions sabbaton as "a shadow." But E4 (Lev 23:38 millibad separation), E8 (different work prohibitions), E9 (Num 28-29 separate category), E13-E14 (creation origin), N2 (explicit textual separation), N3-N7 (vocabulary distinctions) all present textual evidence of a distinction. To maintain I3, one must override the millibad separation in Lev 23:38 (E4/N2) and the creation grounding (E13-E14). | Requires overriding multiple E/N statements: the millibad separation (E4/N2), the vocabulary distinctions (N3, N4), the structural separation (N1, N5), and the creation grounding (E13-E14). The claim that all sabbaths are one unified system requires treating the textual distinctions as insignificant, which adds a concept the text does not contain. | #1 (adding concept: "all sabbaths are one system" when the text distinguishes them), #3 (applying framework of law-as-unified-unit) |
| I4 | The weekly Sabbath was included as a "moed" (appointed time) in Lev 23:2, and the v.4 restart is merely a structural feature, not a categorical separation. | I-B | FOR: E1 (Lev 23:2 uses moadim, then v.3 states the weekly Sabbath); the word moadim in v.2 could grammatically encompass everything that follows, including v.3. AGAINST: E2 (v.4 restarts with the same formula); E3-E4 (v.37-38 summary separates feasts from sabbaths); N1 (structural break); N2 (millibad separation); N8 (weekly Sabbath never called moed elsewhere). | Requires reading the v.2 moadim as categorically encompassing the weekly Sabbath, against the v.37-38 summary that separates them. The question is whether v.2 introduces the whole chapter's topic or categorically classifies the weekly Sabbath as a moed. | #2 (choosing between two possible readings of the v.2-3-4 structure) |
| I5 | The Day of Atonement's sharing of weekly-Sabbath vocabulary (shabbath shabbathon, kol-melakhah) shows that the line between weekly and ceremonial sabbaths is not absolute, undermining the distinction. | I-B | FOR: E6 (Day of Atonement uses shabbath shabbathon); E8 (Day of Atonement shares the full work prohibition). AGAINST: E4-E5, E7 (the other feast days do NOT share this vocabulary); N3-N4 (the vocabulary distribution still distinguishes most feast days from the weekly Sabbath); the Day of Atonement is the singular exception, not the pattern. | Requires generalizing from the Day of Atonement exception to deny the overall vocabulary distinction. The fact that one annual feast shares the weekly Sabbath's vocabulary does not erase the distinction for the other feasts. | #1 (adding concept: one exception invalidates the pattern), #5 (systematizing the exception into a universal claim) |

### I-B Resolution: I2 -- Referent of "sabbath days" in Col 2:16

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (ceremonial sabbaths): E4 (Lev 23:38: feasts "beside" weekly sabbaths), E18 (OT ceremonial triad), N2 (millibad separation)
- AGAINST (could include weekly): E19 (sabbaton has broad semantic range in NT)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E4 (Lev 23:38) | Plain | Directly addresses the distinction between weekly sabbaths and feast sabbaths using an explicit separating preposition. Legal prose. |
| E18 (OT triad) | Contextually Clear | The triad appears consistently in ceremonial-calendar contexts. Requires genre/context awareness to see the pattern. |
| E19 (Col 2:16) | Ambiguous | The word sabbaton can refer to either the weekly Sabbath or ceremonial sabbath days. The verse itself does not specify which. |
| N2 (millibad separation) | Plain | Directly states that the weekly sabbaths are "beside" the feasts. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR (ceremonial sabbaths): Two Plain items (E4, N2), one Contextually Clear (E18). AGAINST: One Ambiguous item (E19).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements (E4/N2: Lev 23:38 explicitly distinguishes weekly sabbaths from feast sabbaths) and the Contextually Clear pattern (E18: the OT ceremonial triad) determine the reading of the Ambiguous item (E19: sabbaton in Col 2:16). Since the OT itself distinguishes weekly sabbaths from ceremonial feast sabbaths, and the Col 2:16 triad matches the OT ceremonial triad pattern, the plain OT passages govern the ambiguous NT usage. *(Examined in depth in law-08-abolished-at-cross.)*

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate toward Continues.**
Plain statements on one side (Lev 23:38 explicitly separating weekly sabbaths from feasts), Contextually Clear on the same side (OT triad pattern), with only Ambiguous text on the other side (sabbaton's semantic range). The reading that Col 2:16 refers to ceremonial sabbaths is supported by the stronger textual evidence.

### I-B Resolution: I4 -- Was the weekly Sabbath included as a moed in Lev 23:2?

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (weekly Sabbath is a moed): E1 (v.2 uses moadim, v.3 states weekly Sabbath)
- AGAINST (weekly Sabbath is not a moed): E2 (v.4 restart), E3-E4 (v.37-38 summary separates them), N1 (structural break), N2 (millibad separation), N8 (Sabbath never called moed elsewhere)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E1 (v.2-3 sequence) | Ambiguous | v.2 introduces "feasts" then v.3 states the Sabbath. Whether v.2's moadim categorizes the Sabbath or merely introduces the chapter topic is not specified by v.2-3 alone. |
| E2 (v.4 restart) | Contextually Clear | The identical formula restart marks a structural division. Requires observing the repetition pattern. |
| E3-E4 (v.37-38) | Plain | The summary explicitly separates the feasts (v.37) from the sabbaths (v.38) with millibad. This directly addresses whether the weekly Sabbath belongs to the moadim category. |
| N1 (structural break) | Contextually Clear | Follows from observing the v.4 restart. |
| N2 (millibad) | Plain | Directly states the separation. |
| N8 (never called moed) | Plain | Verifiable vocabulary fact across the entire Pentateuch. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: One Ambiguous item (E1). AGAINST: Three Plain items (E3-E4, N2, N8), two Contextually Clear (E2, N1).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements (the v.37-38 summary, the millibad separation, and the absence of moed for the weekly Sabbath) determine the reading of the Ambiguous v.2-3 sequence. The summary at the end of the chapter (v.37-38) clarifies the structure at the beginning (v.2-3): v.2 introduces the chapter's general topic, v.3 states the weekly Sabbath as a distinct institution, and v.4 begins the moadim list proper.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong toward Continues.**
Plain statements on one side with only an Ambiguous text on the other. The text's own summary (v.37-38) resolves the question of whether v.2 categorizes the weekly Sabbath as a moed.

### I-B Resolution: I5 -- Does the Day of Atonement's vocabulary undermine the distinction?

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (undermines distinction): E6 (Day of Atonement uses shabbath shabbathon), E8 (shares full work prohibition)
- AGAINST (does not undermine): E5, E7 (Trumpets and Tabernacles use shabbathon alone), N3-N4 (vocabulary distribution still distinguishes most feasts), E4/N2 (millibad separation stands regardless)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E6 (Day of Atonement vocab) | Plain | Observable Hebrew vocabulary fact. |
| E8 (Day of Atonement work prohibition) | Plain | Observable fact about the work level. |
| E5, E7 (Trumpets/Tabernacles vocab) | Plain | Observable Hebrew vocabulary facts showing the other feasts do NOT share this. |
| N3-N4 (distribution pattern) | Plain | Observable distribution of vocabulary across the chapter. |
| E4/N2 (millibad separation) | Plain | Addresses the weekly/ceremonial distinction directly. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: Two Plain items about the Day of Atonement specifically. AGAINST: Multiple Plain items about the broader pattern and the explicit millibad separation. The Day of Atonement is one feast out of seven; the other six maintain the vocabulary distinction.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Day of Atonement's shared vocabulary is a textual fact (E6, E8). The broader pattern (N3, N4) and the millibad separation (E4/N2) are also textual facts. The Day of Atonement is a documented exception within an otherwise consistent pattern. The exception does not require reading the broader pattern as nonexistent.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate toward Continues.**
The Day of Atonement's shared vocabulary is an acknowledged textual fact, but it is a singular exception within an otherwise consistent vocabulary and structural pattern. The millibad separation in v.38 stands regardless of the Day of Atonement's vocabulary.

## 4. Verification Phase

### Step A: Verify explicit statements
Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases actual verse text. All are the plain meaning of the words in the verse.

### Step A2: Verify positional classifications
- E4 (Continues): Passed all four gates (documented above).
- E8 (Continues): Passed all four gates (documented above).
- E9 (Continues): Passed all four gates (documented above).
- E14 (Continues): Passed all four gates (documented above).
- E20 (Continues): Passed all four gates (documented above).
- All Neutral items: Do not trigger V1 or V2 vocabulary scan, or concern vocabulary/structural facts both sides acknowledge.

### Step B: Verify necessary implications
- N1: Follows from E1+E2+E3. The structural arrangement is observable. Any reader can see v.4 restarts the formula after v.3.
- N2: Follows from E3+E4. millibad means "apart from." No reader can deny this creates a separation in the text.
- N3-N4: Follow from E1, E5, E6, E7, E8. Observable vocabulary facts in the Hebrew text.
- N5: Follows from E9+E10. Observable organizational structure.
- N6: Follows from E11+E12. Observable facts in the creation narrative.
- N7: Follows from N3+N4+E8. Observable correlation between vocabulary and work prohibition level.
- N8: Follows from E23+E24. Verifiable absence of terminology.

### Step C-D: Verify inference classifications
- I1 (I-A): Source test -- all components are in E/N tables. Direction test -- does not require any E/N statement to mean something other than its lexical value. Systematizes multiple E/N items. Confirmed I-A.
- I2 (I-B): Source test -- uses E/N items from both sides. Direction test -- requires choosing what sabbaton means in Col 2:16. Confirmed I-B. Has E/N on both sides (E4/E18/N2 FOR, E19 AGAINST).
- I3 (I-D): Source test -- requires adding the concept "all sabbaths are one unified system," which no E/N item states. Direction test -- requires overriding E4/N2 (millibad separation). Confirmed I-D.
- I4 (I-B): Source test -- uses E/N items from both sides. Direction test -- requires choosing how to read v.2-3-4 structure. Confirmed I-B. Has E/N on both sides.
- I5 (I-B): Source test -- uses E/N items from both sides. Direction test -- the Day of Atonement exception is a textual fact; the question is whether it undermines the pattern. Confirmed I-B.

### Step E: Consistency checks
- I1 (I-A): Only requires criterion #5 (systematizing). Confirmed.
- I2 (I-B): Has E/N on both sides. Confirmed.
- I3 (I-D): Overrides E4/N2. Confirmed.
- I4 (I-B): Has E/N on both sides. Confirmed.
- I5 (I-B): Has E/N on both sides. Confirmed.

### Step F: Verify SIS connections
- I2 SIS: Connection between OT triad (2 Chr 31:3; Eze 45:17; Hos 2:11) and Col 2:16 is via shared vocabulary pattern (feast/new moon/sabbaths). Documented as #4a (shared vocabulary).
- I4 SIS: Connection between v.37-38 summary and v.2-3 introduction is within the same chapter. Documented as #4a (self-interpreting text).

## 6. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

### What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):

1. Leviticus 23 presents the weekly Sabbath (v.3) in a structurally separate section from the annual feasts (v.4-36), with v.4 restarting the feast list formula after v.3.
2. Leviticus 23:37-38 explicitly places "the sabbaths of the LORD" as "beside" (millibad, separate from) the annual feasts just summarized.
3. The Hebrew text uses two distinct vocabulary levels for sabbath-rest in Leviticus 23: shabbath shabbathon for the weekly Sabbath (and Day of Atonement) vs. shabbathon alone for Trumpets and Tabernacles rest days.
4. The Hebrew text uses two distinct levels of work prohibition: "all work" (kol-melakhah) for the weekly Sabbath and Day of Atonement vs. "servile work" (melekhet abodah) for the other feast days.
5. Numbers 28-29 organizes the Sabbath offering in its own category (28:9-10), between the daily and monthly offerings and separate from the annual feast offerings (28:16-29:38).
6. Genesis 1:14 assigns the moadim (appointed times) to the governance of the luminaries; the weekly sabbath is not listed and was established three days after the luminaries were created.
7. The weekly Sabbath is never called a moed or a chag in the Pentateuch.
8. The weekly Sabbath is grounded in creation (Gen 2:2-3) and the fourth commandment (Exo 20:8-11), not in the ceremonial calendar.
9. The OT uses a recurring triad (feasts/new moons/sabbaths) in ceremonial calendar contexts (2 Chr 31:3; Eze 45:17; Hos 2:11), and Colossians 2:16 uses the same triad.
10. Isaiah 66:23 presents both the weekly Sabbath and the new moon as continuing in the new earth.

### What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):

1. It cannot be said that the Bible treats all sabbaths as one undifferentiated category. The text itself distinguishes them by vocabulary, work prohibition levels, structural arrangement, and explicit separation (millibad).
2. It cannot be said that the weekly Sabbath is one of the moadim (appointed feasts). The text never calls the weekly Sabbath a moed, and Lev 23:37-38 explicitly separates the moadim from "the sabbaths of the LORD."
3. It cannot be said on the basis of Leviticus 23 alone that the Day of Atonement is "the same as" the weekly Sabbath. It shares the weekly Sabbath's vocabulary and work prohibition level but remains an annual feast within the moadim system (v.37).
4. It cannot be said with certainty from Colossians 2:16 alone whether "sabbath days" refers to the weekly Sabbath or the ceremonial sabbaths. The word sabbaton has a semantic range that permits either reading. The identification requires cross-referencing with the OT ceremonial triad pattern.
5. It cannot be said that the vocabulary distinctions (shabbath shabbathon vs. shabbathon alone) by themselves prove the weekly Sabbath is moral law and the feast sabbaths are ceremonial. The vocabulary distinction is a textual fact; the theological categorization (moral vs. ceremonial) requires systematizing multiple lines of evidence.
6. It cannot be said that Leviticus 23:2 categorizes the weekly Sabbath as a moed. The text of v.2 introduces the chapter's topic; the v.37-38 summary clarifies that the moadim are the annual feasts, "beside" the weekly sabbaths.
