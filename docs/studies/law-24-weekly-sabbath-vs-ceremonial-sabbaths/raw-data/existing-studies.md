### law-02-law-before-sinai (score: 0.55)
- Traced sabbath from creation through pre-Sinai
- Word study on shabath verb (H7673) vs shabbath noun (H7676)
- The verb shabath appears at creation (Gen 2:2-3)
- The noun shabbath first appears in Exo 16:23
- Verb-to-noun progression shows Sabbath concept predates its formal naming

### law-13-jesus-and-sabbath (score: 0.60)
- Word study on shabbath (H7676) and shabbathon (H7677)
- Shabbathon: "From [H7676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7676/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; a sabbatism or special holiday -- rest, sabbath"
- 11 occurrences of shabbathon
- Used for BOTH weekly Sabbath (Exo 31:15; 35:2; Lev 23:3) AND ceremonial rest days (Lev 16:31; 23:24,32,39; 25:4-5)
- The shared vocabulary makes the textual distinctions (like millibad) even more important
- Jesus affirms the Sabbath in every controversy

### sabbath-still-in-effect (score: 0.63)
- Capstone study establishing Sabbath's continued validity from prior studies

### sabbath-shadow-or-memorial (score: 0.55)
- Established that the Sabbath is a creation memorial (points backward), not a typological shadow (points forward)
- Key distinction: shadows point forward to Christ's fulfillment; memorials commemorate past acts of God
- The weekly Sabbath commemorates creation (Gen 2:2-3; Exo 20:11) -- it does not foreshadow anything

### Related law-series studies
The full law series (law-01 through law-23) has systematically established:
- The distinction between moral law (Decalogue) and ceremonial law (Mosaic ordinances)
- The Sabbath commandment is part of the Decalogue (moral law, written on stone by God)
- Ceremonial laws were given "beside" or "in addition to" the moral law
- The NT treats these categories differently: the moral law continues; the ceremonial law is fulfilled in Christ
