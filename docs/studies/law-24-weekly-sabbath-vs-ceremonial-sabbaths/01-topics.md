## Question
How does God distinguish the seventh-day Sabbath from the ceremonial sabbaths when they are first introduced? Investigate Leviticus 23 where both appear: the weekly Sabbath stated first (v.3) as a distinct category, then the seven annual feasts (v.4-36), and v.37-38 explicitly separating them: "These are the feasts of the LORD... BESIDE the sabbaths of the LORD." Examine Hebrew vocabulary: shabbath vs shabbathon, moed vs shabbath, "sabbaths of the LORD" vs "feast sabbaths." Study Leviticus 23 structure. Investigate Leviticus 25 land sabbaths. Also Numbers 28-29 where offerings are listed separately. Examine Genesis 1:14. Does the Bible itself distinguish the weekly Sabbath from the annual ceremonial sabbaths?
