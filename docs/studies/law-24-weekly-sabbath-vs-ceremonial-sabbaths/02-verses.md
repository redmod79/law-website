## LEVITICUS 23 -- The Primary Text (Complete Chapter)

### Leviticus 23:1-3 -- Introduction and Weekly Sabbath

> **Leviticus 23:1** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
>
> **Leviticus 23:2** Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, [Concerning] the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim [to be] holy convocations, [even] these [are] my feasts.
>
> **Leviticus 23:3** Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day [is] the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work [therein]: it [is] the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.

**Key observations on v.1-3:**
- v.2: "feasts" = Hebrew *moadim* (H4150, appointments); "holy convocations" = *miqra qodesh* (H4744 + H6944)
- v.3: The weekly Sabbath is stated FIRST, before the annual feasts begin. Uses *shabbath shabbathon* (H7676 + H7677) -- "sabbath of rest." Also *miqra-qodesh* (holy convocation). Ends with "it is the sabbath of the LORD (*shabbat hi laYHWH*) in all your dwellings (*moshbotekem*)."
- The phrase "in all your dwellings" is unique to the weekly Sabbath in this chapter -- the annual feasts are observed at a central location.

### Leviticus 23:4 -- The Restart of the Feast List

> **Leviticus 23:4** These [are] the feasts of the LORD, [even] holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.

**Key observation:** v.4 restarts the list with "These are the feasts (*moadim*) of the LORD" -- the same phrase as v.2 but now applied specifically to the annual calendar. This restart after v.3 structurally separates the weekly Sabbath from the annual feasts.

### Leviticus 23:5-8 -- Passover and Unleavened Bread

> **Leviticus 23:5** In the fourteenth [day] of the first month at even [is] the LORD'S passover.
>
> **Leviticus 23:6** And on the fifteenth day of the same month [is] the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.
>
> **Leviticus 23:7** In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
>
> **Leviticus 23:8** But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day [is] an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work [therein].

**Key observation:** v.7-8 prohibit "servile work" (*melekhet abodah*) -- a narrower prohibition than v.3 which prohibits ALL work (*kol-melakhah lo taasu*).

### Leviticus 23:9-14 -- Firstfruits

> **Leviticus 23:9** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
>
> **Leviticus 23:10** Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:
>
> **Leviticus 23:11** And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
>
> **Leviticus 23:12** And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.
>
> **Leviticus 23:13** And the meat offering thereof [shall be] two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD [for] a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof [shall be] of wine, the fourth [part] of an hin.
>
> **Leviticus 23:14** And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: [it shall be] a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

### Leviticus 23:15-22 -- Feast of Weeks (Pentecost)

> **Leviticus 23:15** And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:
>
> **Leviticus 23:16** Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.
>
> **Leviticus 23:17** Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; [they are] the firstfruits unto the LORD.
>
> **Leviticus 23:18** And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be [for] a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, [even] an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.
>
> **Leviticus 23:19** Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
>
> **Leviticus 23:20** And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits [for] a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
>
> **Leviticus 23:21** And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, [that] it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work [therein: it shall be] a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
>
> **Leviticus 23:22** And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I [am] the LORD your God.

### Leviticus 23:23-25 -- Feast of Trumpets

> **Leviticus 23:23** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
>
> **Leviticus 23:24** Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first [day] of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.
>
> **Leviticus 23:25** Ye shall do no servile work [therein]: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

**Key observation:** v.24 uses *shabbathon* (H7677) alone -- NOT *shabbath shabbathon* as in v.3. The rest is "sabbatical" but not the "sabbath of rest" that describes the weekly Sabbath.

### Leviticus 23:26-32 -- Day of Atonement

> **Leviticus 23:26** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
>
> **Leviticus 23:27** Also on the tenth [day] of this seventh month [there shall be] a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
>
> **Leviticus 23:28** And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it [is] a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.
>
> **Leviticus 23:29** For whatsoever soul [it be] that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.
>
> **Leviticus 23:30** And whatsoever soul [it be] that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.
>
> **Leviticus 23:31** Ye shall do no manner of work: [it shall be] a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
>
> **Leviticus 23:32** It [shall be] unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth [day] of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

**Key observation:** v.32 uses *shabbath shabbathon* -- the SAME phrase as v.3. This is the only annual feast that receives this designation along with the full work prohibition (v.28,30-31 "no work" vs "no servile work" for other feasts). The Day of Atonement is unique among the feasts in sharing this vocabulary with the weekly Sabbath.

### Leviticus 23:33-36 -- Feast of Tabernacles

> **Leviticus 23:33** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
>
> **Leviticus 23:34** Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month [shall be] the feast of tabernacles [for] seven days unto the LORD.
>
> **Leviticus 23:35** On the first day [shall be] an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work [therein].
>
> **Leviticus 23:36** Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it [is] a solemn assembly; [and] ye shall do no servile work [therein].

### Leviticus 23:37-38 -- THE DECISIVE SUMMARY

> **Leviticus 23:37** These [are] the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim [to be] holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:
>
> **Leviticus 23:38** Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.

**Key observation:** v.37 summarizes the feasts (*moadim*) just described (v.4-36). v.38 then says all of these are "BESIDE (*millibad*) the sabbaths of the LORD (*shabbetot YHWH*)." The four-fold use of *millibad* places the weekly sabbaths, gifts, vows, and freewill offerings as items SEPARATE FROM the feast system just described.

### Leviticus 23:39-44 -- Tabernacles Conclusion and Chapter Close

> **Leviticus 23:39** Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day [shall be] a sabbath, and on the eighth day [shall be] a sabbath.
>
> **Leviticus 23:40** And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.
>
> **Leviticus 23:41** And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. [It shall be] a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
>
> **Leviticus 23:42** Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:
>
> **Leviticus 23:43** That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I [am] the LORD your God.
>
> **Leviticus 23:44** And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.

**Key observation on v.39:** Uses *shabbathon* (H7677) alone for the first and eighth days of Tabernacles -- NOT *shabbath shabbathon*. These are ceremonial rest days, not the weekly Sabbath.

## NUMBERS 28-29 -- The Complete Offering Schedule

### Numbers 28:1-8 -- Daily Offerings (Continual Burnt Offering)

> **Numbers 28:1** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
>
> **Numbers 28:2** Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, [and] my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, [for] a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.
>
> **Numbers 28:3** And thou shalt say unto them, This [is] the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, [for] a continual burnt offering.
>
> **Numbers 28:4** The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;
>
> **Numbers 28:5** And a tenth [part] of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth [part] of an hin of beaten oil.
>
> **Numbers 28:6** [It is] a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.
>
> **Numbers 28:7** And the drink offering thereof [shall be] the fourth [part] of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy [place] shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD [for] a drink offering.
>
> **Numbers 28:8** And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer [it], a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

### Numbers 28:9-10 -- SABBATH Offerings (Distinct Category)

> **Numbers 28:9** And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour [for] a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:
>
> **Numbers 28:10** [This is] the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

**Key observation:** The Sabbath has its OWN offering category -- separate from both the daily offerings (v.1-8) and the annual feast offerings (v.16ff). The text states "the burnt offering of EVERY sabbath" -- this is a weekly cycle, not an annual one.

### Numbers 28:11-15 -- New Moon Offerings (Distinct Category)

> **Numbers 28:11** And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;
>
> **Numbers 28:12** And three tenth deals of flour [for] a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour [for] a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;
>
> **Numbers 28:13** And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil [for] a meat offering unto one lamb; [for] a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.
>
> **Numbers 28:14** And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third [part] of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth [part] of an hin unto a lamb: this [is] the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.
>
> **Numbers 28:15** And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

### Numbers 28:16-25 -- Passover/Unleavened Bread Offerings

> **Numbers 28:16** And in the fourteenth day of the first month [is] the passover of the LORD.
>
> **Numbers 28:17** And in the fifteenth day of this month [is] the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
>
> **Numbers 28:18** In the first day [shall be] an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work [therein]:
>
> **Numbers 28:19** But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire [for] a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish:
>
> **Numbers 28:20-25** [Detailed offering prescriptions for each day of the feast]

### Numbers 28:26-31 -- Feast of Weeks (Pentecost) Offerings

> **Numbers 28:26** Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your weeks [be out], ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:
>
> **Numbers 28:27-31** [Detailed offering prescriptions]

### Numbers 29:1-6 -- Feast of Trumpets Offerings

> **Numbers 29:1** And in the seventh month, on the first [day] of the month, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you.
>
> **Numbers 29:2-6** [Detailed offering prescriptions; v.6 notes "Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering, and the daily burnt offering"]

### Numbers 29:7-11 -- Day of Atonement Offerings

> **Numbers 29:7** And ye shall have on the tenth [day] of this seventh month an holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall not do any work [therein]:
>
> **Numbers 29:8-11** [Detailed offering prescriptions]

### Numbers 29:12-38 -- Feast of Tabernacles Offerings

> **Numbers 29:12** And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days:
>
> **Numbers 29:13-38** [Detailed day-by-day offering prescriptions for all seven days plus the eighth day solemn assembly; notably the bullocks decrease from 13 on day 1 to 7 on day 7]

### Numbers 29:39-40 -- Closing Summary

> **Numbers 29:39** These [things] ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts, beside your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings, and for your meat offerings, and for your drink offerings, and for your peace offerings.
>
> **Numbers 29:40** And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.

**Key observation:** The closing summary uses "set feasts" (*moadim*, H4150) -- the same word used in Lev 23. It also uses "beside" (*millibad*) for vows and freewill offerings, paralleling the structure of Lev 23:38.

**Structural summary of Numbers 28-29:**
1. Daily offerings (28:1-8) -- continual cycle
2. **SABBATH offerings (28:9-10) -- weekly cycle, distinct category**
3. New Moon offerings (28:11-15) -- monthly cycle
4. Annual feast offerings (28:16-29:38) -- yearly cycle
5. Summary (29:39-40) -- "set feasts" with vows and freewill offerings "beside"

## LEVITICUS 25 -- Land Sabbaths

### Leviticus 25:1-7 -- Sabbatical Year

> **Leviticus 25:1** And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,
>
> **Leviticus 25:2** Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.
>
> **Leviticus 25:3** Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;
>
> **Leviticus 25:4** But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
>
> **Leviticus 25:5** That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: [for] it is a year of rest unto the land.
>
> **Leviticus 25:6** And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,
>
> **Leviticus 25:7** And for thy cattle, and for the beast that [are] in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.

**Key observation:** v.4 uses *shabbath shabbathon* -- the same phrase as the weekly Sabbath (Lev 23:3) and Day of Atonement (Lev 23:32). The sabbatical year follows the same 6+1 pattern as the weekly Sabbath: six years of work, seventh year of rest.

### Leviticus 25:8-12 -- Jubilee Year

> **Leviticus 25:8** And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.
>
> **Leviticus 25:9** Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth [day] of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
>
> **Leviticus 25:10** And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout [all] the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
>
> **Leviticus 25:11** A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather [the grapes] in it of thy vine undressed.
>
> **Leviticus 25:12** For it [is] the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.

### Leviticus 26:34-35 -- The Land Enjoying Sabbaths

> **Leviticus 26:34** Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye [be] in your enemies' land; [even] then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.
>
> **Leviticus 26:35** As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

## GENESIS -- Creation Week and Luminaries

### Genesis 1:14-19 -- The Luminaries for Seasons

> **Genesis 1:14** And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
>
> **Genesis 1:15** And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
>
> **Genesis 1:16** And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.
>
> **Genesis 1:17** And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
>
> **Genesis 1:18** And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that [it was] good.
>
> **Genesis 1:19** And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

**Key observation:** v.14 "seasons" = Hebrew *moadim* (H4150) -- the same word used for the annual festivals in Lev 23:2,4. The luminaries were given for: signs (*otot*), moadim (appointed times/seasons), days (*yamim*), and years (*shanim*). The weekly sabbath is conspicuously absent from this list. The luminaries govern the astronomical/calendar cycles (monthly, annual), but the weekly sabbath is independent of them -- it was established on the seventh day of creation (Gen 2:2-3), which was Day 7, three days AFTER the luminaries were created on Day 4.

### Genesis 2:1-3 -- The Sabbath at Creation

> **Genesis 2:1** Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
>
> **Genesis 2:2** And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
>
> **Genesis 2:3** And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

**Key observation:** Three acts of God on the seventh day: (1) He rested (*vayyishbot*, from *shabath*, H7673); (2) He blessed it (*vaybarak*); (3) He sanctified it (*vayqaddesh*). This precedes all ceremonial law by millennia. The weekly Sabbath is rooted in creation, not in the Mosaic ceremonial system.

---

## EXODUS -- Sabbath Commandment and Manna

### Exodus 20:8-11 -- The Fourth Commandment

> **Exodus 20:8** Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
>
> **Exodus 20:9** Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:
>
> **Exodus 20:10** But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of the LORD thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is] within thy gates:
>
> **Exodus 20:11** For [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them [is], and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

**Key observation:** v.10 "the sabbath of the LORD thy God" -- the same possessive formula as Lev 23:3 ("the sabbath of the LORD") and Lev 23:38 ("the sabbaths of the LORD"). The ground for the Sabbath is CREATION (v.11), not the exodus or any ceremonial event.

### Deuteronomy 5:12-15 -- The Sabbath Repeated

> **Deuteronomy 5:12** Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.
>
> **Deuteronomy 5:13** Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:
>
> **Deuteronomy 5:14** But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of the LORD thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is] within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.
>
> **Deuteronomy 5:15** And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and [that] the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.

### Exodus 16:23-30 -- Manna and the Sabbath

> **Exodus 16:23** And he said unto them, This [is that] which the LORD hath said, To morrow [is] the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake [that] which ye will bake [to day], and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
>
> **Exodus 16:25** And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day [is] a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.
>
> **Exodus 16:26** Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, [which is] the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
>
> **Exodus 16:29** See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
>
> **Exodus 16:30** So the people rested on the seventh day.

**Key observation:** The manna cycle confirms the weekly sabbath is a continuous 6+1 cycle, independent of the lunar month. This is enforced for 40 years in the wilderness -- the sabbath never falls on a different day based on the lunar calendar.

---

## COLOSSIANS 2:16-17 -- The "Sabbath Days" Question

### Colossians 2:14-17 (with context)

> **Colossians 2:14** Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
>
> **Colossians 2:15** [And] having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
>
> **Colossians 2:16** Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath [days]:
>
> **Colossians 2:17** Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body [is] of Christ.

**Key observation:** v.16 uses the triad "holyday (*heortes*, G1859) / new moon (*neomenias*, G3561) / sabbath days (*sabbaton*, G4521)." This same triad appears in the OT ceremonial context passages below.

### OT Ceremonial Triad Parallels

> **2 Chronicles 31:3** [He appointed] also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, [to wit], for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the **sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts**, as [it is] written in the law of the LORD.

> **Ezekiel 45:17** And it shall be the prince's part [to give] burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the **feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths**, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.

> **Hosea 2:11** I will also cause all her mirth to cease, **her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths**, and all her solemn feasts.

**Key observation:** The triad "feasts/new moons/sabbaths" appears as a unit describing the ceremonial calendar system. In Col 2:16, Paul uses the same triad, referring to the ceremonial sabbaths (annual feast sabbaths), not the weekly Sabbath.

---

## ISAIAH -- Sabbath as Distinct from Feasts

### Isaiah 66:22-23

> **Isaiah 66:22** For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
>
> **Isaiah 66:23** And it shall come to pass, [that] from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.

**Key observation:** The weekly Sabbath and the monthly new moon are listed as two distinct, ongoing cycles in the new earth -- both continuing into eternity.

### Isaiah 1:13-14

> **Isaiah 1:13** Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; [it is] iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
>
> **Isaiah 1:14** Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear [them].

**Key observation:** God is rebuking empty ritual observance. v.13 uses "new moons and sabbaths" (weekly cycle), v.14 uses "new moons and appointed feasts (*moadim*)" (annual cycle). Both are mentioned but distinguished.

---

## EZEKIEL 20 -- Sabbaths as a Sign

> **Ezekiel 20:12** Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I [am] the LORD that sanctify them.
>
> **Ezekiel 20:13** But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments... and my sabbaths they greatly polluted...
>
> **Ezekiel 20:16** Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.
>
> **Ezekiel 20:20** And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I [am] the LORD your God.
>
> **Ezekiel 20:21** Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me... they polluted my sabbaths...
>
> **Ezekiel 20:24** Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.

**Key observation:** "My sabbaths" as a "sign" between God and Israel. Compare Exo 31:13,17 where the Sabbath is explicitly a sign of the creation relationship. The sabbaths are consistently grouped with "my statutes" and "my judgments" -- moral/relational categories.

## EZEKIEL 46 -- Sabbath and New Moon Distinguished

> **Ezekiel 46:1** Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
>
> **Ezekiel 46:3** Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.
>
> **Ezekiel 46:4** And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day [shall be] six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.
>
> **Ezekiel 46:5** And the meat offering [shall be] an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.

## NEHEMIAH 9:13-14 -- "Thy Holy Sabbath"

> **Nehemiah 9:13** Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:
>
> **Nehemiah 9:14** And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:

**Key observation:** "Thy HOLY sabbath" -- singular, specific, referring to the weekly Sabbath as something God "made known" to them. It is grouped with the moral/civil legislation given at Sinai, not with the ceremonial feasts.

## HEBREWS 4:4,9 -- Sabbath Rest Continues

> **Hebrews 4:4** For he spake in a certain place of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
>
> **Hebrews 4:9** There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
>
> **Hebrews 4:10** For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God [did] from his.

**Key observation:** v.9 uses *sabbatismos* (G4520) -- a unique word meaning "a Sabbath-keeping" or "a sabbath rest." The author connects this back to the creation Sabbath of Gen 2:2-3 (cited in v.4), affirming the ongoing significance of Sabbath rest for God's people.

---

## PSALM 92 -- A Psalm for the Sabbath Day

> **Psalm 92:1** A Psalm [or] Song for the sabbath day. [It is a] good [thing] to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:
>
> **Psalm 92:2** To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
>
> **Psalm 92:4** For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
>
> **Psalm 92:5** O LORD, how great are thy works! [and] thy thoughts are very deep.

**Key observation:** The only psalm designated specifically for the Sabbath. Its theme is praise for God's creative works (v.4-5) -- connecting the weekly Sabbath to creation.
