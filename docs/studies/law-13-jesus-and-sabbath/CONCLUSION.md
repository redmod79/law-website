# What Do Jesus's Sabbath Actions and Teachings Reveal About the Sabbath's Continuing Validity?

## Question
What do Jesus's Sabbath actions and teachings reveal about the Sabbath's continuing validity? Every Sabbath controversy, habitual practice, eiothos, "Lord of the Sabbath," Isaiah 58 guidelines, post-crucifixion Sabbath evidence.

## Summary Answer
Every recorded Sabbath controversy shows Jesus arguing WITHIN the Sabbath's legal framework (using exesti, "is it lawful?"), never arguing that the Sabbath lacks binding law. He declares His disciples "guiltless" (anaitioi) under the biblical Sabbath standard, defines lawful Sabbath activity (doing good, healing, loosing from bondage), and declares healing morally obligatory (edei) on the Sabbath. His settled custom (eiothos, Perfect tense) was Sabbath synagogue worship. As "Lord of the Sabbath" (kurios tou sabbatou), He exercises governing authority by defining the Sabbath's true requirements, not by abolishing it. Post-crucifixion evidence confirms continuity: the disciples rest "according to the commandment" (Luke 23:56), Jesus instructs prayer about Sabbath flight decades after the cross (Mat 24:20), and Paul's settled custom matches Jesus's (Acts 17:2, kata to eiothos). Isaiah 58:13 provides God's objective standard for Sabbath observance, and Jesus's practice aligns with it. Hebrews 4:9 uses sabbatismos (sabbath-keeping, not generic rest) to affirm that a Sabbath-keeping "remaineth" for the people of God.

## Key Verses

**Hebrews 4:9** -- "There remaineth therefore a rest [sabbatismos] to the people of God."

**Matthew 5:17-18** -- "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law."

### 1. Explicit Statements Table

Each E-item has been processed through Tree 1 (Tier Classification) and Tree 3 (E-Item Positional Classification) from the law-series methodology.

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Position | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Jesus's "custom" (eiothos, [G1486](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1486/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, Perfect Active Participle) was to go into the synagogue on the sabbath day. The Perfect tense indicates a settled, completed, ongoing habit. | Luk 4:16 | Neutral | E320 |
| E2 | Luke uses the IDENTICAL Greek construction kata to eiothos (G1486, Perfect Active Participle) for both Jesus (Luk 4:16) and Paul (Acts 17:2) -- same author, same construction, same form. | Luk 4:16; Acts 17:2 | Neutral | E321 |
| E3 | The exesti (G1832, "it is lawful") framework appears in 12 Sabbath controversy instances across all four Gospels. Both Pharisees and Jesus use exesti to debate WHAT is lawful on the Sabbath. | Mat 12:2,4,10,12; Mrk 2:24,26; 3:4; Luk 6:2,4,9; 14:3; Jhn 5:10 | Neutral | E322 |
| E4 | Jesus declares His disciples "guiltless" (anaitioi, G338): "ye would not have condemned the guiltless." | Mat 12:7 | Continues | E323 |
| E5 | Jesus states that "on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless [anaitioi]" -- authorized divine service is not a Sabbath violation. | Mat 12:5 | Continues | E324 |
| E6 | Jesus states: "It is lawful [exestin] to do well [kalos poiesai / agathopoiesai] on the sabbath days." Affirmative declaration of lawful Sabbath activity. | Mat 12:12; Mrk 3:4; Luk 6:9 | Continues | E325 |
| E7 | "The sabbath was made [egeneto, G1096, Aorist] for man [anthropon, G444], and not man for the sabbath." Aorist points to creation event. Anthropon = generic humanity. | Mrk 2:27 | Neutral | E326 |
| E8 | "Therefore the Son of man is Lord [kurios, G2962] also of the sabbath." Kurios + genitive of domain = authority over the Sabbath. The text states authority; it does NOT state abolition. | Mrk 2:28 | Neutral | E327 |
| E9 | Jesus uses "ought not [ouk edei, G1163]" for healing on the Sabbath. Dei/edei expresses MORAL NECESSITY -- it was not merely permitted but morally obligatory. | Luk 13:16 | Continues | E328 |
| E10 | Jesus uses the SAME VERB luo (G3089) for both animals being "loosed" from stalls on the Sabbath (v.15) and the woman who "ought to be loosed" from bondage on the Sabbath (v.16). | Luk 13:15-16 | Neutral | E329 |
| E11 | John 5:18 reports the Jews' accusation that Jesus "had broken the sabbath." This is the accusation of hostile opponents -- same verse also reports their blasphemy charge, which the NT does not endorse as accurate. | Jhn 5:18 | Neutral | E330 |
| E12 | Jesus states "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work" as His defense of Sabbath healing -- appealing to the Father's continuing activity. | Jhn 5:17 | Neutral | E331 |
| E13 | Jesus argues from circumcision on the Sabbath: "If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?" | Jhn 7:22-23 | Neutral | E332 |
| E14 | The women "rested the sabbath day according to the commandment [kata ten entolen]" -- AFTER the crucifixion. Luke calls the Sabbath "the commandment" without qualification in a post-crucifixion context. | Luk 23:56 | Continues | E333 |
| E15 | Jesus instructs: "Pray ye that your flight be not...on the sabbath day" in a prophecy about AD 70 -- approximately 40 years after the crucifixion. | Mat 24:20 | Continues | E334 |
| E16 | Isaiah 58:13 states God's standard for Sabbath observance: turning away from chephets (personal pleasure/business), calling the Sabbath oneg (delight), honoring God's qodesh (holy) day. | Isa 58:13 | Continues | E335 |
| E17 | Isaiah 58:14 states the divine promise for proper Sabbath observance: "Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD...for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it." | Isa 58:14 | Continues | E336 |
| E18 | "There remaineth therefore a rest [sabbatismos, G4520] to the people of God." Apoleipetai = Present Passive -- is currently remaining. Sabbatismos = practice of Sabbath-keeping. The author switches from katapausis (8 times in Heb 3-4) to sabbatismos in v.9 only. | Heb 4:9 | Continues | E337 |
| E19 | Paul's Sabbath observance in Acts: Acts 17:2 (three Sabbaths, Thessalonica), Acts 18:4 (every Sabbath, Jews AND Greeks, Corinth), Acts 16:13 (Philippi -- no synagogue, Paul sought Sabbath worship at a riverside). | Acts 17:2; 18:4; 16:13 | Neutral | E338 |
| E20 | Gentile believers at Antioch in Pisidia requested Paul preach "the next sabbath" (Acts 13:42) and "the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together" (Acts 13:44). | Acts 13:42, 44 | Continues | E339 |
| E21 | The Fourth Commandment cites creation as its rationale: "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth...and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day." The Sabbath is grounded in creation before any national covenant. | Gen 2:2-3; Exo 20:8-11 | Continues | E340 |
| E22 | Jesus closes His Sabbath defense with: "Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment" -- calling for proper judgment about the Sabbath, not abandonment. | Jhn 7:24 | Neutral | E341 |

**Tree 3 positional traces (summary for Continues items):**

- **E4, E5 (anaitioi):** V1 = Yes (judicial innocence under moral law standard; distinguishes biblical Sabbath from Pharisaic tradition -- a distinction within Sabbath observance). Gate 1: PASS (referent identified: the disciples' action under the Fourth Commandment). Gate 2: PASS (grammar unambiguous). Gate 3: PASS (narrative report of direct speech). Gate 4: PASS (consistent with E021/Mat 5:17 -- Jesus does not abolish the law). -> Continues.

- **E6 (lawful to do good):** V1 = Yes (affirms lawful activity on the Sabbath, operating within its framework). Gates 1-4: PASS. -> Continues.

- **E9 (edei -- moral obligation):** V1 = Yes (healing on the Sabbath is morally necessary under the Sabbath's own character). Gates 1-4: PASS. -> Continues.

- **E14, E15 (post-cross observance):** V1 = Yes (Sabbath observance continues post-crucifixion; "according to the commandment" applies entole to the Sabbath). Gates 1-4: PASS. -> Continues.

- **E16, E17 (Isa 58:13-14):** V1 = Yes (God's own standard for Sabbath observance; treats the Sabbath as "my holy day"). Gates 1-4: PASS. -> Continues.

- **E18 (sabbatismos):** V1 = Yes (practice of Sabbath-keeping remains for God's people; post-cross writing). Gates 1-4: PASS. Gate 4 note: consistent with E021 (law permanence) and E086 (creation-grounded commandment). -> Continues.

- **E20 (Gentile Sabbath request):** V1 = Yes (Gentile believers adopt Sabbath pattern). Gates 1-4: PASS. -> Continues.

- **E21 (creation rationale):** V1 = Yes (Sabbath grounded in creation, not national covenant -- creation-origin supports Continues position on Sabbath's universal scope). Gates 1-4: PASS. -> Continues.

**Neutral item traces (representative):**

- **E1-E3, E7-E8, E10-E13, E19, E22:** These are factual observations both sides accept -- grammatical data (Perfect tense of eiothos), vocabulary distributions (exesti framework), reported accusations (John 5:18), creation facts (egeneto/anthropon), and authority statements (kurios without stated abolition). V1 and V2 both NO -> Neutral.

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | Jesus's habitual Sabbath observance (eiothos, Perfect Active Participle) was a settled, ongoing practice -- the Greek Perfect tense indicates a completed action with ongoing present results. | E1 (E320) | Continues | N065 |
| N2 | The text "the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath" states governing authority (kurios + genitive), not abolition. Any abolition conclusion requires adding what the text does not say. | E8 (E327) | Neutral | N066 |
| N3 | The exesti framework in 12 Sabbath controversy instances presupposes the Sabbath's continuing legal force -- every controversy is a debate about WHAT is lawful, not WHETHER the Sabbath has binding law. | E3 (E322) | Continues | N067 |
| N4 | The declaration "ye would not have condemned the guiltless" is a verdict of judicial INNOCENCE under the applicable Sabbath standard. The disciples did not violate the biblical Sabbath; they violated Pharisaic oral tradition. | E4, E5 (E323, E324) | Continues | N068 |
| N5 | Healing on the Sabbath in Luk 13:16 was not merely permitted but MORALLY OBLIGATORY (ouk edei). The imperfect rhetorical question assumes an affirmative answer. | E9, E10 (E328, E329) | Continues | N069 |
| N6 | The women's Sabbath rest "according to the commandment" (Luk 23:56) occurs after the crucifixion; combined with Mat 24:20 (prayer instruction about Sabbath 40 years post-cross), both texts treat the Sabbath as operative after the cross. | E14, E15 (E333, E334) | Continues | N070 |
| N7 | Isaiah 58:13 provides an objective, God-given standard for Sabbath observance. The objection "no one can know what proper Sabbath observance looks like" is not derived from Scripture. | E16, E17 (E335, E336) | Continues | N071 |

**N-Tier verification (Tree 4 -- Gate 0):**

- **N1:** N-Test 1: Would a scholar from the opposite position agree that the Perfect tense indicates ongoing habit? YES -- grammatical fact. N-Test 2: Only one possible conclusion from Perfect tense? YES. N-Test 3: No added concepts? YES. -> PASS. Then positional classification: V1 = Yes (settled Sabbath observance by Jesus supports Sabbath's continuing validity). -> Continues.

- **N2:** N-Test 1: Would both sides agree the text states authority, not abolition? YES -- the text says "Lord of" not "abolisher of." N-Test 2/3: YES. -> PASS. V1: No. V2: No. -> Neutral.

- **N3:** N-Test 1: Would both sides agree exesti presupposes a legal framework? YES -- that is what exesti means. N-Test 2: Only one conclusion from a lawfulness debate? YES -- there is a law in force. N-Test 3: No added concepts? YES. -> PASS. V1 = Yes. -> Continues.

- **N4:** N-Test 1: Would both sides agree anaitios means judicially innocent? YES -- lexical fact. N-Test 2: Only one conclusion from "guiltless"? The step to "violated Pharisaic tradition, not biblical Sabbath" follows from the combined fact that Jesus calls them innocent while the Pharisees call them guilty -- the standard they met and the standard they failed are different. N-Test 3: No added concepts? YES. -> PASS. V1 = Yes. -> Continues.

- **N5:** N-Test 1: Would both sides agree edei means moral necessity? YES -- lexical fact. N-Test 2/3: YES. -> PASS. V1 = Yes. -> Continues.

- **N6:** N-Test 1: Would both sides agree Luke 23:56 describes post-crucifixion Sabbath observance "according to the commandment" and Mat 24:20 describes future Sabbath concern? YES -- textual facts. N-Test 2: The only conclusion from these two facts is that the Sabbath is treated as operative after the cross. N-Test 3: No added concepts. -> PASS. V1 = Yes. -> Continues.

- **N7:** N-Test 1: Would both sides agree Isaiah 58:13 provides a standard? YES -- the text explicitly instructs how to keep the Sabbath. N-Test 2/3: YES. -> PASS. V1 = Yes. -> Continues.

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | Position | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria | Master ID |
|---|-------|------|----------|-----|------|----------|---|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that Jesus's habitual Sabbath observance (eiothos, Luk 4:16) demonstrates the Sabbath's continuing validity as a binding institution: the incarnate Son of God maintained a settled Sabbath custom throughout His earthly ministry. | I-A | Continues | E320/N065 (ongoing habit), E021/Mat 5:17 (no demolition of law), N062/Isa 42:21 (magnification), E321/Luk 4:16+Acts 17:2 (continuity to Paul), E327/Mrk 2:28 (Lord of Sabbath), N067 (lawfulness framework). | Systematizes multiple E/N items into a comprehensive claim about what Jesus's Sabbath practice means for the institution's binding force. All components text-derived. | #5 (systematizing) | I082 |
| I2 | The Bible teaches that "Lord of the Sabbath" (kurios tou sabbatou, Mrk 2:28) means Jesus has governing authority over the Sabbath's proper use -- He defines what is truly lawful on it -- rather than meaning He abolished it. | I-A | Continues | E327 (kurios + genitive = governing authority), E326/Mrk 2:27 (Sabbath made for man), E021/Mat 5:17 (explicit denial of kataluo), N065 (Jesus's own ongoing Sabbath custom). | Systematizes the authority claim with the ongoing-practice evidence and law-permanence claim. All text-derived. | #5 (systematizing) | I083 |
| I3 | The Bible teaches that "Lord of the Sabbath" means Jesus has authority TO ABOLISH the Sabbath -- lordship includes power to end it. | I-B | Both (resolved Strong toward Continues/governing authority) | FOR: kurios = supreme authority (semantic range includes power to change). AGAINST: N066 (text states authority, not abolition -- adding abolition supplies what text does not say); E021/Mat 5:17 (kataluo denial); E323-E325 (Jesus defends AS LAWFUL in same controversy); N065 (ongoing custom); N067 (lawfulness framework); E333-E334/N070 (post-cross observance). | Both sides can cite E/N items. Competing textual evidence. | #2 (choosing between readings), #4b (cross-referencing) | I084 |
| I4 | The Bible teaches that "the Sabbath was made for man" (Mrk 2:27) establishes the Sabbath as a creation ordinance for all humanity: egeneto (Aorist) points to creation; anthropon = generic humanity; Fourth Commandment cites creation as rationale. | I-A | Continues | E326 (egeneto + anthropon), Gen 2:2-3, E340 (Exo 20:11 creation rationale). | Systematizes creation origin + universal scope + creation rationale into a comprehensive claim. All text-derived. | #5 (systematizing) | I085 |
| I5 | The Bible teaches that Jesus's Sabbath healings constitute an affirmation and deepening (magnification) of the Sabbath's purpose -- demonstrating what the Sabbath positively requires. | I-A | Continues | E325 (lawful to do well), E328/N069 (healing morally obligatory), E329 (luo parallel), E327/I082 (Lord governs use), E044/N062 (Servant magnifies law), E335 (Isa 58:13 standard). | Systematizes healing evidence with magnification theology and Isaiah 58 standard. All text-derived. | #5 (systematizing) | I086 |
| I6 | The Bible teaches that Isaiah 58:13's standard provides an objective God-given criterion for distinguishing proper Sabbath observance from both Pharisaic legalism and personal self-seeking. Jesus's Sabbath practice aligns with Isaiah 58's standard in every instance. | I-A | Continues | E335-E336/N071 (God's Sabbath standard), E325-E328 (Jesus's lawful activities), N067 (lawfulness framework), E323 (Pharisaic tradition vs. biblical Sabbath). | Systematizes the OT standard with Jesus's NT practice. All text-derived. | #5 (systematizing) | I087 |
| I7 | The Bible teaches that "Lord of the Sabbath" means Jesus abolished the Sabbath at the cross, since His authority as Lord is sufficient to terminate the institution. | I-D | Abolished | Requires overriding: N066 (text draws no abolition conclusion); E021/Mat 5:17 (explicit denial of kataluo); E333/N070 (post-cross observance "according to the commandment"); E334/N070 (prayer about Sabbath 40 years post-cross); N065 (settled custom); N067 (lawfulness framework). | Requires overriding multiple E/N statements that treat the Sabbath as continuing. Adds the concept "abolished" to a text that states "Lord." | #1 (adding a concept), overrides E/N | I088 |
| I8 | The Bible teaches that "the Sabbath was made for man" means the Sabbath is optional -- something made for man's benefit can be declined by any individual. | I-D | Abolished | Requires overriding: N067 (lawfulness framework -- not optional); E333/N070 (post-cross "commandment" -- commandment = not optional); E334/N070 (prayer instruction presupposes binding force); N065 (Jesus's own custom); Exo 20:8 "Remember" is imperative. | External concept: "optional" is not in the text. The word "made for" does not lexically entail "optional." | #1 (adding concept), #3 (external framework), overrides E/N | I089 |
| I9 | The Bible teaches that John 5:18's report that Jesus "broke the Sabbath" constitutes inspired evidence that Jesus did in fact break the Sabbath. | I-D | Abolished | Requires overriding: E330 (text reports accusation of hostile opponents, not inspired verdict); E330's parallel blasphemy accusation (not endorsed); Jhn 9:30-33 (God would not empower a genuine Sabbath-breaker); E323-E325 (Jesus consistently defends AS LAWFUL); N068 (guiltless under biblical standard). | Treats a hostile accusation as authoritative. Overrides the same text's report of a blasphemy charge that the NT does not endorse. | #1 (adding concept: accusation = verdict), overrides E/N | I090 |

### I-B Resolution: I3 -- "Lord of the Sabbath" = Authority to Abolish?

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR: E327 (kurios = supreme authority; semantic range includes power to change/end); Mat 12:8/Mrk 2:28/Luk 6:5 assert lordship without stated limitation.
- AGAINST: N066 (text states authority, does NOT state abolition); E021/Mat 5:17 (kataluo denial in the same Matthean context); E323-E325 (in the same controversy, Jesus defends disciples AS LAWFUL -- operates within Sabbath framework); N065 (Jesus's own ongoing Sabbath custom presupposes continuing binding force); N067 (every controversy operates within lawfulness framework); E333-E334/N070 (post-cross observance "according to the commandment" and prayer instruction).

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E327 | Ambiguous | Text states "Lord of the sabbath." Whether this includes power to abolish or only governing authority requires interpretation. |
| N066 | Plain | Direct observation: the text says "Lord," not "abolisher." |
| E021 | Plain | Explicit denial of kataluo toward the law, same author (Matthew), same discourse context. |
| E323-E325 | Plain | In the same controversy, Jesus defends His disciples as lawful -- presupposes the Sabbath's framework. |
| N065 | Contextually Clear | Perfect tense of eiothos establishes ongoing custom -- requires grammatical awareness but is unambiguous. |
| N067 | Plain | 12 instances of exesti across four Gospels -- observable pattern. |
| E333, E334 | Plain | Post-cross observance stated without qualification. |
| N070 | Contextually Clear | Combines two texts to show post-cross Sabbath as operative. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: One Ambiguous item (E327 read as including abolition power).
AGAINST: Five Plain items (N066, E021, E323-E325, N067, E333-E334) and two Contextually Clear items (N065, N070).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements determine the reading of the Ambiguous one. E021 (explicit denial of law-demolition) and E323-E325 (lawfulness defense in the same controversy) govern E327's ambiguity. The clear reading: "Lord of the Sabbath" = governing authority over what the Sabbath requires.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong toward governing authority / Continues.**
Five Plain statements on the Continues side with only one Ambiguous statement on the Abolished side.

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies)

1. Jesus's settled custom (eiothos, Perfect tense) was Sabbath synagogue worship throughout His earthly ministry (Luk 4:16).
2. Every recorded Sabbath controversy operates within the exesti ("is it lawful?") framework -- debating WHAT is lawful on the Sabbath, not WHETHER the Sabbath has binding law (12 instances across four Gospels).
3. Jesus declared His disciples "guiltless" (anaitioi) -- judicially innocent under the biblical Sabbath standard, not violators of the Fourth Commandment (Mat 12:7).
4. Jesus affirmed: "It is lawful to do well on the sabbath days" (Mat 12:12) -- a positive standard for Sabbath activity.
5. Jesus declared Sabbath healing morally obligatory (edei, Luk 13:16), not merely permitted.
6. Jesus stated: "The sabbath was made for man" (anthropon -- generic humanity) using egeneto (Aorist -- pointing to creation), grounding the Sabbath in creation before any national covenant (Mrk 2:27).
7. Jesus declared Himself "Lord of the Sabbath" (kurios tou sabbatou) -- the text states governing authority, not abolition (Mrk 2:28).
8. After the crucifixion, the women "rested the sabbath day according to the commandment" (Luk 23:56) -- Luke calls the Sabbath "the commandment" (entole) post-cross.
9. Jesus instructed prayer about Sabbath flight in a prophecy about AD 70 -- approximately 40 years after the cross (Mat 24:20).
10. Paul shared the identical eiothos construction for Sabbath practice (Acts 17:2), reasoned in the synagogue "every sabbath" (Acts 18:4), and sought Sabbath worship even without a synagogue (Acts 16:13).
11. Gentile believers adopted the Sabbath pattern (Acts 13:42, 44).
12. Isaiah 58:13 provides an objective, God-given standard for Sabbath observance: cease self-directed activity, call it a delight, honor God's holy day.
13. The Hebrews author uses sabbatismos (G4520, sabbath-keeping -- not katapausis/generic rest) and states it "remaineth" (Present Passive) for the people of God (Heb 4:9).
14. Jesus denied coming to demolish the law (kataluo, Mat 5:17) and stated the law endures till heaven and earth pass (Mat 5:18). The Sabbath commandment is part of this law.

## What CANNOT Be Said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture)

1. It CANNOT be said that Jesus abolished, revoked, or declared the Sabbath no longer binding in any recorded statement. No such statement exists in the Gospels.
2. It CANNOT be said that "Lord of the Sabbath" means Jesus terminated the Sabbath. The text states authority (kurios), not abolition. An abolition conclusion requires adding what the text does not contain.
3. It CANNOT be said that "the Sabbath was made for man" means the Sabbath is optional. The word "made for" does not lexically entail "optional," and every controversy operates within a binding-law framework.
4. It CANNOT be said that John 5:18's report that Jesus "broke the sabbath" is an inspired verdict. The same verse reports a blasphemy charge the NT does not endorse. Both are the opponents' perspective.
5. It CANNOT be said that Jesus's Sabbath healings demonstrate the Sabbath's obsolescence. Jesus consistently defended His healings AS LAWFUL Sabbath activity, not as evidence against the Sabbath.
6. It CANNOT be said that "sabbath days" in Colossians 2:16 self-evidently refers to the weekly Sabbath. The ceremonial triad (holyday/new moon/sabbath) matches the annual feast calendar pattern, and Lev 23:37-38 explicitly separates feast sabbaths from weekly Sabbaths.
7. It CANNOT be said that the Sabbath was established only at Sinai. Gen 2:2-3, Exo 16:4-29 (pre-Sinai manna test), Exo 20:8 ("Remember" -- presupposing prior existence), and Mrk 2:27 (egeneto -- creation-origin) all point to a pre-Sinai institution.
8. It CANNOT be said that Sabbath-keeping standards are unknowable or purely subjective. Isaiah 58:13 provides God's explicit standard: cease self-directed activity, call it a delight, honor God's holy day.
9. It CANNOT be said that there was no Sabbath observance after the crucifixion. Luke 23:56 and the Acts passages document ongoing Sabbath practice by Jesus's followers and Paul.
10. It CANNOT be said that Jesus sided with the Pharisees' Sabbath standards. He consistently distinguished the biblical Sabbath from Pharisaic oral traditions and declared His disciples innocent of the Pharisees' charges.

## Conclusion

This study examined every recorded Sabbath controversy (grain plucking: Mat 12:1-8 / Mrk 2:23-28 / Luk 6:1-5; withered hand: Mat 12:9-14 / Mrk 3:1-6 / Luk 6:6-11; bent woman: Luk 13:10-17; man with dropsy: Luk 14:1-6; pool of Bethesda: Jhn 5:1-18; circumcision argument: Jhn 7:21-24; man born blind: Jhn 9:1-34), Jesus's habitual practice (Luk 4:16; 4:31; Mrk 1:21; 6:2), post-crucifixion evidence (Luk 23:56; Mat 24:20; Acts 13:14,42,44; 16:13; 17:2; 18:4), Isaiah 58:13-14 as objective Sabbath guidelines, and Hebrews 4:9 (sabbatismos).

Of the 22 explicit statements identified, 11 use law-continuation vocabulary applied to the Sabbath (judicial innocence, lawful to do good, moral obligation to heal, post-cross observance "according to the commandment," prayer about Sabbath flight, sabbatismos remaining, creation rationale), and 0 use cessation vocabulary applied to the Sabbath. The remaining 11 are Neutral factual observations both sides accept.

Of the 7 necessary implications, 6 point toward the Continues position (settled habit, lawfulness framework presupposes binding law, judicial innocence under biblical standard, moral obligation, post-cross observance, objective standard from Isaiah 58), and 1 is Neutral.

Of the 9 inferences, 5 are I-A Evidence-Extending (all Continues), 1 is I-B Competing-Evidence (resolved Strong toward Continues), and 3 are I-D Counter-Evidence External (all Abolished -- each requires overriding multiple E/N items).

No explicit statement or necessary implication supports the Abolished position. All Abolished claims for this study's data are classified at the I-D level -- requiring external concepts and overriding what the text states.
