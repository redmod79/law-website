## Related Topics Discovered
- The SABBATH topic in Nave's covers the full scope needed: origin (Gen 2:2-3), Sinai legislation (Exo 20:8-11), prophetic teaching (Isa 56, 58, 66), Jesus's controversies (all four Gospels), apostolic practice (Acts), and the NT theological passages (Col 2:16, Heb 4:9).
- The COMMANDMENTS topic provides the framework for understanding Jesus's relationship to the law (Mat 5:17-20; 19:16-19; 22:34-40), including the crucial "commandments of men" category (Isa 29:13; Mat 15:3-20; Mark 7:2-23) which distinguishes God's actual commandments from human traditions -- directly relevant to the Pharisaic Sabbath regulations Jesus opposed.
- The SYNAGOGUE topic confirms the regular Sabbath worship pattern: Jesus and Paul both used synagogues on the Sabbath as their primary teaching venues.
