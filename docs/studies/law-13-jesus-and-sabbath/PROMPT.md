# Bible Study: Jesus and the Sabbath -- Actions, Teachings, and Continuing Validity

## Question
What do Jesus's Sabbath actions and teachings reveal about the Sabbath's continuing validity? Investigate every recorded Sabbath controversy: healing on the Sabbath (Mat 12:9-14, Mark 3:1-6, Luke 6:6-11, Luke 13:10-17, Luke 14:1-6, John 5:1-18, John 9:1-16), plucking grain (Mat 12:1-8, Mark 2:23-28, Luke 6:1-5). Study "The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath" (Mark 2:28), "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath" (Mark 2:27), "it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days" (Mat 12:12). Examine Jesus's habitual Sabbath practice: "as his custom was" (Luke 4:16, eiothos). Did Jesus abolish, change, or affirm the Sabbath? Address the objection that Sabbath-keeping standards are subjective and unknowable -- investigate Isaiah 58:13-14 as God's own guidelines for Sabbath observance. Does Jesus's example provide an objective standard (lawful to do good, healing, meeting needs) that distinguishes proper Sabbath-keeping from rabbinical legalism?

## Methodology
Read and apply the methodology in `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-series-methodology.md`. This study is part of the Law of God series and must follow the investigative methodology, evidence classification system (E/N/I with four inference subtypes), classification decision trees, and master evidence file update protocol specified therein.

| law-08-abolished-at-cross | "What was abolished at the cross?" | Established that dogma/cheirographon were abolished, not entole/Decalogue; no passage names the Decalogue as abolished |

**Key findings from prior study conclusions:**

1. **law-01 (God's moral law):** The Decalogue is distinguished by 7 unique markers (God's voice, God's finger, stone, inside the ark, "he added no more," "the covenant," "the testimony"). Its attributes (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal) mirror God's character. End-time saints "keep the commandments of God" (Rev 14:12).

2. **law-03 (Exodus 20 vs. later laws):** Five dimensions distinguish the Decalogue from subsequent legislation: delivery mode, authorship, repository, naming conventions, and boundary marker ("he added no more").

3. **law-04 (Ceremonial laws):** The weekly Sabbath is listed separately from the annual feasts in Lev 23 (v.3 vs. vv.4ff). Lev 23:37-38 uses "beside the sabbaths of the LORD" to explicitly separate feast sabbaths from weekly Sabbaths.

4. **law-08 (Abolished at cross):** None of the seven primary abolition passages names the Decalogue as abolished. The vocabulary dogma (G1378) identifies what was nailed/abolished; it is never used for the Decalogue.

5. **law-09 (Old covenant/new covenant):** The new covenant changes WHERE the law is (stone to hearts), HOW obedience occurs (human effort to Spirit), WHO mediates (Moses to Christ), and the BASIS (animal blood to Christ's blood) -- but not WHAT law is in force. "My law" (torati) is the constant.

6. **law-10 (New covenant and law):** The new covenant passages consistently describe God's pre-existing moral law being written on hearts. Possessive pronouns ("MY law," "MY laws," "MY statutes") identify the content as God's own law.

7. **law-11 (Written on hearts):** The law written on hearts is identified as the moral law (Decalogue) by four textual markers: berith-Decalogue equation, kathab/grapho verb connection, stone-to-heart medium contrast, and Hebrews 10 dual operation.

8. **law-12 (Matthew 5:17-20):** Kataluo (G2647) consistently means demolish/annul; Jesus' emphatic double denial excludes abrogation. Pleroo (G4137) means to fill full with intended meaning (magnify). The permanence statement ties the law to the cosmos. The six antitheses demonstrate deepening, not replacement.

9. **jesus-and-the-sabbath (prior standalone study):** Jesus affirms the Sabbath in every controversy; He defines lawful Sabbath activity (doing good, healing, loosing from bondage); "Lord of the Sabbath" means He governs it, not destroys it; His settled custom was Sabbath worship; disciples rested "according to the commandment" (Luke 23:56).

10. **sabbath-shadow-or-memorial:** The Sabbath is a creation memorial (zakar = remember; points backward to Gen 2:2-3), not a typological shadow (skia = forward-pointing). Sabbatismos (Heb 4:9) affirms Sabbath-keeping remains.

### Focus Areas
(Derived from tool discoveries -- topics and verses found by Nave's, Strong's, and existing study searches)

1. **Every Sabbath controversy classified and analyzed:** Use the law-series evidence classification (E/N/I) for each controversy passage. The tool-discovered verse set includes Mat 12:1-14, Mark 2:23-3:6, Luke 6:1-11, Luke 13:10-17, Luke 14:1-6, John 5:1-18, John 7:21-24, John 9:1-34.

2. **Three key declarations classified:** "The sabbath was made for man" (Mark 2:27), "The Son of man is Lord of the sabbath" (Mark 2:28), "It is lawful to do well on the sabbath days" (Mat 12:12). Each must be analyzed for what it explicitly says and what each position infers.

3. **Jesus's habitual Sabbath practice:** Luke 4:16 (eiothos, [G1486](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1486/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- settled custom); Luke 4:31; Mark 1:21; Mark 6:2. The same eiothos construction appears in Acts 17:2 for Paul.

4. **Isaiah 58:13-14 as objective Sabbath-keeping guidelines:** The tool found ISA 58:13,14 in the SABBATH topic entry. This provides God's own standard: (a) "turn away thy foot from the sabbath" (cease commerce/labor), (b) "from doing thy pleasure on my holy day" (prioritize God's purposes), (c) "call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable" (positive attitude), (d) "not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words" (self-surrender). This addresses the objection that Sabbath-keeping standards are subjective.

5. **Did Jesus abolish, change, or affirm the Sabbath?** The evidence from every controversy shows Jesus arguing WITHIN the Sabbath framework (using exesti = "is it lawful?"), never arguing that the Sabbath is no longer binding. He declares the disciples "guiltless" (anaitios) -- innocent of Sabbath violation. He defines what IS lawful on the Sabbath, presupposing the Sabbath has law.

6. **Jesus's example as objective standard vs. rabbinical legalism:** The tool-discovered data shows Jesus consistently distinguishing between the Fourth Commandment's actual requirements and Pharisaic oral traditions (39 categories of work). His standard: doing good (agathopoieo, G15), saving life, healing, loosing from bondage, meeting genuine needs = lawful on the Sabbath. His contrast: Pharisaic rules against healing, plucking grain for food, loosing animals = human additions.

7. **Post-crucifixion Sabbath evidence:** Mat 24:20 (Jesus expects Sabbath observance decades after the cross), Luke 23:56 (disciples rest "according to the commandment"), Acts passages showing apostolic Sabbath practice.

8. **Ezekiel 20:12,20 -- Sabbath as sign:** "I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them." The Sabbath as ongoing sign of God's sanctifying relationship.

9. **Colossians 2:16 clarification:** The "sabbath days" in Col 2:16 are part of the ceremonial triad (holyday/new moon/sabbath -- matching 2 Chr 31:3; Eze 45:17; Hos 2:11). Prior studies (law-04, sabbath-shadow-or-memorial) established these as annual feast sabbaths, not the weekly Sabbath. The weekly Sabbath is explicitly separated: "beside the sabbaths of the LORD" (Lev 23:37-38).

10. **Connection to law-12 (Mat 5:17-20):** Jesus's Sabbath actions are the practical demonstration of what pleroo ("fulfil") looks like applied to the Fourth Commandment. He fills the Sabbath with its intended meaning (doing good, healing, liberation) while stripping away human additions. This is the magnification of Isaiah 42:21.
