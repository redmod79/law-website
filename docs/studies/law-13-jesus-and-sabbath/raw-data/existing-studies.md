### jesus-and-the-sabbath (prior standalone study)
**Question:** What do Jesus's Sabbath actions and teachings reveal about the Sabbath's purpose, authority, and continuity?
**Key finding:** Jesus affirms the Sabbath in every controversy; He defines lawful Sabbath activity (doing good, healing, loosing from bondage); "Lord of the Sabbath" means He governs it, not destroys it; His settled custom was Sabbath worship; disciples rested "according to the commandment" (Luke 23:56).
**Relevance:** Direct predecessor -- this law-13 study applies the law-series methodology and evidence classification (E/N/I).

### sabbath-shadow-or-memorial
**Question:** Is the Sabbath a type/shadow fulfilled in Christ, or a creation memorial that continues?
**Key finding:** The Sabbath is a creation memorial (zakar = remember; points backward to Gen 2:2-3), not a typological shadow (skia = forward-pointing). Sabbatismos (Heb 4:9) affirms Sabbath-keeping remains.
**Relevance:** Established that the Sabbath is NOT a shadow in the Colossians 2:16-17 sense.

### sabbath-still-in-effect
**Question:** Is the 7th-day Sabbath still in effect and binding on Christians today?
**Key finding:** Capstone study establishing Sabbath's continued validity from 8 prior studies.
**Relevance:** Comprehensive prior synthesis on Sabbath validity.

### sabbath-moral-or-ceremonial
**Question:** Is the 7th-day Sabbath a moral law or a ceremonial law?
**Key finding:** The Sabbath is moral law by every biblical criterion.
**Relevance:** Establishes the Sabbath's classification as moral, not ceremonial.

## Law Series Studies

### law-01-gods-moral-law
**Key finding:** The Decalogue is distinguished by 7 unique markers (God's voice, God's finger, stone, inside the ark, "he added no more," "the covenant," "the testimony"). Its attributes (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal) mirror God's character. End-time saints "keep the commandments of God" (Rev 14:12).

### law-03-exodus-20-vs-later-laws
**Key finding:** Five dimensions distinguish the Decalogue from subsequent legislation: delivery mode, authorship, repository, naming conventions, and boundary marker ("he added no more").

### law-04-ceremonial-laws
**Key finding:** The weekly Sabbath is listed separately from the annual feasts in Lev 23 (v.3 vs. vv.4ff). Lev 23:37-38 uses "beside the sabbaths of the LORD" to explicitly separate feast sabbaths from weekly Sabbaths.

### law-08-abolished-at-cross
**Key finding:** None of the seven primary abolition passages names the Decalogue as abolished. The vocabulary dogma (G1378) identifies what was nailed/abolished; it is never used for the Decalogue.

### law-09-old-covenant-new-covenant
**Key finding:** The new covenant changes WHERE the law is (stone to hearts), HOW obedience occurs (human effort to Spirit), WHO mediates (Moses to Christ), and the BASIS (animal blood to Christ's blood) -- but not WHAT law is in force. "My law" (torati) is the constant.

### law-10-new-covenant-and-law
**Key finding:** The new covenant passages consistently describe God's pre-existing moral law being written on hearts. Possessive pronouns ("MY law," "MY laws," "MY statutes") identify the content as God's own law.

### law-11-written-on-hearts
**Key finding:** The law written on hearts is identified as the moral law (Decalogue) by four textual markers: berith-Decalogue equation, kathab/grapho verb connection, stone-to-heart medium contrast, and Hebrews 10 dual operation.

### law-12-matthew-5-17-20
**Key finding:** Kataluo (G2647) consistently means demolish/annul; Jesus' emphatic double denial excludes abrogation. Pleroo (G4137) means to fill full with intended meaning (magnify). The permanence statement ties the law to the cosmos. The six antitheses demonstrate deepening, not replacement.
