## Core Sabbath Terms

### sabbaton (G4521) -- Greek "Sabbath"
**Original:** σάββατον
**Transliteration:** sábbaton
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**Occurrences:** 68 (BLB count); 55 in KJV translation database

**Definition:** Of Hebrew origin (H7676); the Sabbath (i.e. Shabbath), or day of weekly rest.

**Translations:** sabbath (19), sabbath day (13), sabbath days (7), of the week (4), the sabbath day (3), week (3), of the sabbath (2), others (4)

**Key Sabbath Controversy Verses:** Mat 12:1,2,8,12; Mark 1:21; 2:23,24,27,28; 3:2,4; 6:2; Luke 4:16,31; 6:1,2,5,7,9; 13:14,16; 14:1,3,5; 23:56; John 5:9,10,16,18; 7:22,23; 9:14,16; Acts 13:14,27,42,44; 15:21; 16:13; 17:2; 18:4; Col 2:16

**Note:** The same word sabbaton is used for the weekly Sabbath throughout the NT -- in the Gospels for Jesus's Sabbath observance, in Acts for apostolic Sabbath practice, and in Heb 4:9 via the derivative sabbatismos.

### shabbath (H7676) -- Hebrew "Sabbath"
**Original:** שַׁבָּת
**Transliteration:** shabbâth
**Part of Speech:** Masculine/feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 108 (BLB count)

**Definition:** Intensive from [H7673](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7673/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (shabath = to cease, rest); intermission, i.e. specifically the Sabbath.

**Translations:** the sabbath (42), my sabbaths (14), on the sabbath (11), a sabbath (7), sabbath (6), her sabbaths (4), sabbaths (3), others (22)

**Key Verses:** Exo 16:23-29; 20:8-11; 31:13-17; Lev 23:3,32,38; Deu 5:12-15; Neh 13:15-22; Isa 56:2,4,6; 58:13; 66:23; Jer 17:21-27; Eze 20:12,13,20,24

**Note:** The possessive "MY sabbaths" (shabbethotay) appears 14 times -- God claims the Sabbath as His own. Particularly in Ezekiel 20:12,20 ("I gave them MY sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them").

---

### shabbathown (H7677) -- "Sabbatism/Solemn rest"
**Original:** שַׁבָּתוֹן
**Transliteration:** shabbâthôwn
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 11

**Definition:** From [H7676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7676/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; a sabbatism or special holiday -- rest, sabbath. An intensive/emphatic form of sabbath.

**Translations:** of rest (7), a sabbath (3), the rest (1)

**Key Verses:** Exo 16:23 ("rest of the holy sabbath"); 31:15 ("sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD"); Lev 23:3 ("the sabbath of rest"); 23:24,32,39 (applied to feast sabbaths)

---

### sabbatismos (G4520) -- "Sabbath-keeping"
**Original:** σαββατισμός
**Transliteration:** sabbatismós
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 1 (HAPAX LEGOMENON -- appears only once in the NT)

**Definition:** From a derivative of [G4521](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4521/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; a "sabbatism," i.e. the keeping/observance of the Sabbath.

**Translation:** "a rest" (KJV) in Hebrews 4:9

**The single verse:** "There remaineth therefore a rest [sabbatismos] to the people of God." (Heb 4:9)

**Critical observation:** The author of Hebrews deliberately uses sabbatismos (G4520) in 4:9 instead of katapausis (G2663, "rest/cessation") which appears in 4:1,3,4,5,8,10,11. This word change is intentional -- sabbatismos specifically means "sabbath-keeping" or "sabbath observance," not merely abstract rest. The -ismos suffix in Greek denotes the action or practice of something (cf. baptismos = the act of baptizing). The word was used in post-biblical Greek writings (e.g., Plutarch) to mean "sabbath observance."

## Key Controversy Terms

### kurios (G2962) -- "Lord/Master"
**Original:** κύριος
**Transliteration:** kýrios
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 748 (BLB count)

**Definition:** From kyros (supremacy); supreme in authority, i.e. controller; by implication, Master (as a respectful title).

**Translations:** Lord (391), the Lord (108), of the Lord (61), lord (34), others (63)

**Key Sabbath verse:** "Therefore the Son of man is Lord [kurios] also of the sabbath" (Mark 2:28 / Mat 12:8 / Luke 6:5)

**Significance:** Kurios means owner, master, one with supreme authority. A lord governs, directs, and defines -- not destroys. Jesus claims LORDSHIP (authority) over the Sabbath, not abolition of it. A king is lord of his kingdom; he does not destroy it.

---

### exesti (G1832) -- "It is lawful/permitted"
**Original:** ἔξεστι
**Transliteration:** éxesti
**Part of Speech:** Verb (impersonal 3rd person singular)
**Occurrences:** 32 (BLB count)

**Definition:** Third person singular present indicative; it is right, permitted, lawful.

**Translations:** lawful (14), Is it lawful (7), is (4), are lawful (4), It is (3), others (8)

**Key Sabbath verses:**
- Mat 12:2 "that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day"
- Mat 12:10 "Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days?"
- Mat 12:12 "it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days"
- Mark 2:24 "that which is not lawful"
- Mark 3:4 "Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil?"
- Luke 6:2,9 (parallel)
- Luke 14:3 "Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?"
- John 5:10 "it is not lawful for thee to carry [thy] bed"

**Significance:** Every Sabbath controversy centers on this word -- what is LAWFUL (exestin) on the Sabbath. Jesus argues WITHIN the framework of Sabbath law. He never argues that there IS no Sabbath law. He defines what IS lawful, presupposing the Sabbath has binding law.

---

### etho (G1486) -- "Custom/habitual practice"
**Original:** ἔθω / εἴωθα
**Transliteration:** éthō
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Occurrences:** 4 (all NT)

**Definition:** A primary verb; to be used (by habit or conventionality); neuter perfect participle = accustomed, customary.

**All 4 verses:**
- Matthew 27:15 "the governor was wont to release"
- Mark 10:1 "as he was wont, he taught them"
- **Luke 4:16** "as his custom was [kata to eiothos], he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day"
- **Acts 17:2** "Paul, as his manner was [kata to eiothos], went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned"

**Greek parsing (Luke 4:16):** eiothos (εἰωθὸς) = Perfect Active Participle, Accusative Singular Neuter. The PERFECT tense indicates a settled, completed state with ongoing results -- an ESTABLISHED habit, not an occasional practice.

**Significance:** Both Jesus (Luke 4:16) and Paul (Acts 17:2) share the identical construction "kata to eiothos" -- "according to the [established] custom." This demonstrates that Sabbath synagogue worship was the settled, habitual practice of both Jesus and His chief apostle.

---

### therapeuo (G2323) -- "Heal/serve"
**Original:** θεραπεύω
**Transliteration:** therapeúō
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Occurrences:** 44 (BLB count)

**Definition:** From therapon (an attendant); to wait upon menially, i.e. to adore (God), or specifically to relieve (of disease).

**Key Sabbath verses:** Mat 12:10; Mark 3:2,10; Luke 6:7; 13:14; 14:3; John 5:10

**Significance:** Healing is the paradigmatic example of "doing good" (agathopoieo) on the Sabbath. Every Sabbath healing controversy ends with Jesus demonstrating that healing/restoration IS Sabbath-appropriate activity.

---

### luo (G3089) -- "Loose/break/destroy"
**Original:** λύω
**Transliteration:** lýō
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Occurrences:** 43 (BLB count)

**Definition:** A primary verb; to "loosen" (literally or figuratively): break (up), destroy, dissolve, loose, melt, put off.

**Key Sabbath verses:**
- **John 5:18:** eluyen (ἔλυεν, Imperfect Active) -- "he was breaking the sabbath" (the Jews' accusation, not the narrator's affirmation)
- **Luke 13:15:** luei (λύει, Present Active) -- "doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox?"
- **Luke 13:16:** luthenai (λυθῆναι, Aorist Passive Infinitive) -- "ought not this woman be loosed from this bond?"
- **Matthew 5:19:** luse (λύσῃ, Aorist Active Subjunctive) -- "Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments"
- **John 7:23:** "that the law of Moses should not be broken [luo]"
- **John 10:35:** "the scripture cannot be broken [luo]"

**Significance:** The wordplay in Luke 13:15-16 is remarkable: if it is acceptable to "loose" (luo) animals on the Sabbath, then surely it is acceptable to "loose" (luo) a daughter of Abraham from Satan's bonds. In John 5:18, the accusation that Jesus "broke" (eluyen) the Sabbath uses the Jews' perspective -- Jesus never concedes this charge. In Mat 5:19, Jesus says whoever "breaks" (luo) the least commandments will be called least -- the same verb, warning against exactly what the Jews accuse Him of.

---

### agathopoieo (G15) -- "Do good"
**Original:** ἀγαθοποιέω
**Transliteration:** agathopoiéō
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Occurrences:** 11 (BLB count)

**Definition:** From agathopoios; to be a well-doer (as a favor or a duty).

**Key Sabbath verses:**
- Mark 3:4 "Is it lawful to do good [agathopoiesai] on the sabbath days, or to do evil?"
- Luke 6:9 (parallel)
- Luke 6:33,35 (broader usage)

**Significance:** Jesus defines the positive standard for Sabbath activity: doing good. The Sabbath is not defined by negatives alone (don't work) but by a positive principle (do good, heal, save life, loose from bondage).

---

### anaitios (G338) -- "Guiltless/blameless"
**Original:** ἀναίτιος
**Transliteration:** anaítios
**Part of Speech:** Adjective
**Occurrences:** 2 (only in Matthew 12)

**Definition:** From alpha (negative particle) and aitia (accusation); innocent, guiltless, blameless.

**Both verses:**
- Mat 12:5 "the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless [anaitioi]"
- Mat 12:7 "ye would not have condemned the guiltless [anaitious]"

**Significance:** Jesus declares His disciples GUILTLESS of Sabbath-breaking. They did not violate the actual Sabbath commandment; they violated Pharisaic oral traditions about what constituted "work." The priests' temple service on the Sabbath proves that not all activity on the Sabbath constitutes violation -- some activities are Sabbath-appropriate.

---

## Law Permanence Terms (from law-12)

### kataluo (G2647) -- "Destroy/demolish"
**Original:** καταλύω
**Transliteration:** katalýō
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Occurrences:** 17 (BLB count)

**Definition:** From kata and luo; to loosen down (disintegrate), i.e. demolish, destroy, dissolve.

**Key verse:** Mat 5:17 "Think not that I am come to destroy [katalusai] the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy [katalusai], but to fulfil [plerosai]."

**Note:** Shares the root luo with [G3089](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3089/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}. Jesus's emphatic double denial ("think not...I am not come to destroy") excludes any interpretation that He abolished the law, including the Sabbath commandment.

### pleroo (G4137) -- "Fulfil/fill full"
**Original:** πληρόω
**Transliteration:** plēróō
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Occurrences:** 90 (BLB count)

**Definition:** From pleres (full); to make replete, to cram, level up, furnish, satisfy, execute, finish, verify.

**Key verse:** Mat 5:17 "I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil [plerosai]."

**Significance (from law-12):** Pleroo means to fill full with intended meaning -- to magnify, to reveal the complete purpose. Applied to the Sabbath: Jesus fills the Sabbath with its intended purpose (doing good, healing, setting free) while stripping away human additions (Pharisaic oral law restrictions).

## Isaiah 58 Terms

### anag (H6026) -- "Delight"
**Original:** עָנַג
**Transliteration:** ʻânag
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Occurrences:** 10

**Definition:** A primitive root; to be soft or pliable, i.e. (figuratively) effeminate or luxurious: delicate(-ness), (have) delight (self), sport self.

**Key verse:** Isa 58:14 "Then shalt thou delight thyself [tithanag] in the LORD"
**Related:** Isa 58:13 uses the noun form oneg (H6027): "call the sabbath a delight [oneg]"

**Other notable verse:** Psalm 37:4 "Delight thyself [hithanag] also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart."

### kabad (H3513) -- "Honour/glory"
**Original:** כָּבַד
**Transliteration:** kâbad
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Occurrences:** 116

**Definition:** A primitive root; to be heavy, i.e. in a bad sense (burdensome) or in a good sense (numerous, rich, honorable); causatively, to make weighty.

**Key verse:** Isa 58:13 "and shalt honour him [vekibadeto]" -- used in the Piel stem (intensive), meaning to treat as weighty, to give honor/glory.

**Also used in:** Exo 20:12 "Honour [kabad] thy father and thy mother" -- the same verb for honoring parents is used for honoring the Sabbath. Both are moral obligations expressing relationship (child to parent; creature to Creator).

---

## Creation Term

### ginomai (G1096) -- "Come into being/was made"
**Original:** γίνομαι
**Transliteration:** gínomai
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Occurrences:** 678 (BLB count)

**Definition:** A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be ("gen"-erate), i.e. to become, come into being.

**Key Sabbath verse:** Mark 2:27 egeneto (ἐγένετο, Aorist Middle Indicative) -- "The sabbath was made [egeneto] for man"

**Significance:** The aorist tense points to a single past event -- the creation of the Sabbath (Genesis 2:2-3). Jesus grounds the Sabbath not in Sinai legislation but in CREATION. This pre-Sinai origin means the Sabbath predates the Mosaic covenant and is not limited to Israel.

### anthropos (G444) -- "Man/humanity"
**Original:** ἄνθρωπος
**Transliteration:** ánthrōpos
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 559 (BLB count)

**Definition:** Man-faced, i.e. a human being (generic term for humanity, not gender-specific or ethnicity-specific).

**Key Sabbath verse:** Mark 2:27 "The sabbath was made for man [ton anthropon]"

**Significance:** Anthropos is the generic term for humanity -- all human beings. It is not Ioudaios (Jew) or Israelites (Israel). The Sabbath was made for HUMANITY, not for a single nation. This aligns with its creation origin (Gen 2:2-3, before any nations existed).
