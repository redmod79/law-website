# Does the New Covenant Abolish or Establish the Moral Law?

## A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence

This study examines one of the most important questions in all of Scripture: When God promised a "new covenant," did He intend to abolish His moral law -- the Ten Commandments -- or to write that same law on the hearts of His people? The answer matters profoundly, because it shapes how believers understand their relationship to God, to grace, and to obedience.

By carefully examining every major new covenant passage in both the Old and New Testaments, this study finds a consistent biblical pattern: the new covenant changes *where* the law is located, *how* obedience is achieved, and *who* mediates -- but it does not change *what* law is in force. God's moral law remains; only the administrative framework around it changes.

## The New Covenant Promise: God's Own Law on Hearts

The foundational new covenant passage is Jeremiah 31:31-34, where God Himself announces what He will do:

> "I will put MY law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people." (Jeremiah 31:33, KJV)

Two details in this verse are critical. First, God says "MY law." The possessive pronoun -- in Hebrew, *torati* -- identifies the law being written on hearts as God's own pre-existing law, the law that already belonged to Him. He does not say "a new law" or "a different law." He says "MY law" -- the one He had already given.

Second, the Hebrew verb for "write" here is *katab* -- the very same verb used in Exodus 31:18, where God wrote the Ten Commandments on stone tablets. The new covenant takes the same content that was on stone and relocates it to human hearts.

The book of Hebrews quotes this promise twice, confirming it for the New Testament church:

> "I will put MY laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts." (Hebrews 8:10, KJV)

> "I will put MY laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them." (Hebrews 10:16, KJV)

In both instances, the Greek possessive *nomous mou* -- "MY laws" -- identifies the content as God's own. The law does not change; only its location changes, from external stone to the internal heart.

## The Spirit Empowers Obedience to the Same Statutes

One of the most striking features of the new covenant is the role of the Holy Spirit. Under the old covenant, the people had the law written on stone tablets outside of them, but they lacked the internal power to obey. Under the new covenant, God provides the power from within:

> "I will put MY spirit within you, and cause you to walk in MY statutes, and ye shall keep MY judgments, and do them." (Ezekiel 36:27, KJV)

Notice three possessive pronouns in one verse: "MY spirit," "MY statutes," "MY judgments." The Spirit does not introduce new statutes or new judgments. The Spirit *causes* obedience to God's existing statutes and judgments. This is a causal chain -- the Spirit empowers, and the result is walking in the same law God already gave.

The apostle Paul describes the same reality in the New Testament:

> "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." (Romans 8:4, KJV)

The "righteousness of the law" is being fulfilled -- not discarded, not replaced -- in those who walk by the Spirit. The Spirit and the law work together, not against each other.

## The Fault Was With the People, Not With the Law

A critical question is: Why was a new covenant necessary at all? The biblical answer is consistent -- the problem was the people, not the law.

> "For finding fault with THEM, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant." (Hebrews 8:8, KJV)

The Greek text is precise: the word "them" (*autous*) is accusative plural masculine, identifying the people as the object of the blame. God was not finding fault with His law; He was finding fault with the people who broke it.

The original Jeremiah passage says the same thing:

> "Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers...which MY covenant THEY brake." (Jeremiah 31:32, KJV)

The emphatic Hebrew pronoun *hemmah* ("THEY themselves") places the blame squarely on the people. They broke God's covenant. The solution, therefore, is not to discard the law but to provide a new means of enabling obedience -- writing the law on hearts and giving the Spirit to empower compliance.

## Faith Establishes the Law

Some have suggested that salvation by faith through grace replaces the need for God's moral law. The apostle Paul directly addresses this idea and emphatically rejects it:

> "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." (Romans 3:31, KJV)

"God forbid" translates the Greek *me genoito* -- the strongest possible negation in the Greek language. Paul could not have been more emphatic: faith does not nullify the law. Faith *establishes* it. The Greek verb *histanomen* means "to make stand" -- faith causes the law to stand firm.

Paul addresses the same concern from another angle when he writes about being "not under the law, but under grace":

> "What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid." (Romans 6:15, KJV)

Paul immediately denies that "not under the law" means believers are free to sin. The phrase "not under the law" describes a change in the believer's relationship to the law's condemnation -- they are no longer condemned by it -- not a release from moral obligation.

## Love Is Defined as Commandment-Keeping

Throughout the New Testament, love and the commandments are not placed in opposition. Instead, love is defined *as* keeping God's commandments:

> "This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous." (1 John 5:3, KJV)

John does not say love replaces the commandments or that love is an alternative to the commandments. He says love *is* commandment-keeping. This is a definitional statement.

Jesus Himself, on the very night He instituted the new covenant at the Last Supper, said:

> "If ye love me, keep my commandments." (John 14:15, KJV)

And He identified His commandments as His Father's:

> "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love." (John 15:10, KJV)

Paul likewise shows that love fulfills the law by keeping its specific commands, citing five of the Ten Commandments by name:

> "Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law." (Romans 13:9-10, KJV)

Love fulfills the law by keeping its content. Love does not bypass or replace the commandments -- love expresses itself *through* them.

## Ceremonial Laws End; Moral Law Continues

One of the clearest patterns in the New Testament is that ceremonial and sacrificial laws are set aside while the moral law is affirmed -- sometimes in the very same passage.

In Hebrews 10, the author writes that animal sacrifices are taken away:

> "Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin." (Hebrews 10:18, KJV)

Yet in the very same chapter, the Holy Spirit testifies:

> "I will put MY laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them." (Hebrews 10:16, KJV)

Within a single passage, the sacrificial system is removed and the moral law is written on hearts. These are not contradictory; they reflect the biblical pattern of ceremonial cessation alongside moral continuation.

Paul makes the same distinction in a single verse:

> "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God." (1 Corinthians 7:19, KJV)

Circumcision -- a ceremonial requirement -- is dismissed as "nothing." But "the commandments of God" are affirmed as what matters. The moral and ceremonial are distinguished, not merged.

James calls the moral law "the perfect law of liberty" and cites specific commandments from the Decalogue as its content:

> "For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill." (James 2:10-11, KJV)

## The Marks of God's People in the Last Days

The book of Revelation describes the end-time people of God with a striking combination of two traits:

> "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." (Revelation 14:12, KJV)

> "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ." (Revelation 12:17, KJV)

God's people at the end of time are defined by *both* the faith of Jesus *and* keeping the commandments of God. These are not in tension. They are paired together as the twin marks of the faithful.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

Just as important as what the Bible says is what it does *not* say. The following claims are nowhere stated in the new covenant passages:

- **The Bible never says the new covenant introduces a different moral standard to replace the Ten Commandments.** Every new covenant passage that names the law's content identifies it as God's pre-existing law using possessive pronouns ("my law," "my laws," "my statutes," "my judgments").

- **The Bible never says "my law" in Jeremiah 31:33 means something other than God's pre-existing law.** The possessive pronoun in Hebrew (*torati*) identifies it as the law belonging to God -- the law He had already given.

- **The Bible never says that "not under the law" means freedom from moral obligation.** The immediate context (Romans 6:15) explicitly denies this interpretation: "Shall we sin? God forbid."

- **The Bible never names the Decalogue as the thing abolished.** When abolition language appears (such as in Ephesians 2:15 or Hebrews 9:10), the context identifies the referent as ceremonial ordinances, not the moral law.

- **The Bible never says Hebrews 8:13 ("vanishing away") includes the moral law.** The very same chapter, just three verses earlier (Hebrews 8:10), writes "my laws" on hearts. The "vanishing" refers to the old covenant arrangement and its ceremonial system, not to the moral content that is being relocated to the heart.

- **The Bible never says the law and grace are opposites.** Paul denies that the law opposes God's promises (Galatians 3:21) and affirms that faith establishes the law (Romans 3:31).

- **The Bible never names any specific new set of commands that replaces the Decalogue in the new covenant.** No passage identifies such a replacement.

- **The Bible never says "the law was added till the seed should come" (Galatians 3:19) means the moral law ceases to exist.** Jesus said the law endures "till heaven and earth pass" (Matthew 5:18), and Paul himself said "we establish the law" (Romans 3:31).

## Conclusion

The biblical evidence on the new covenant and the moral law presents a consistent picture across the Old and New Testaments, across multiple authors, and across different literary genres. The new covenant changes the *administration* -- where the law resides, what power enables obedience, who mediates, what blood ratifies, and what scope of forgiveness is offered. But the moral law itself remains constant.

God's possessive pronouns ("MY law," "MY laws," "MY statutes," "MY judgments") identify the content written on hearts as His own pre-existing moral law. The stone-to-heart motif describes relocation, not replacement. The Spirit empowers obedience to the same statutes, not obedience to different ones. Faith establishes the law rather than nullifying it. Love is defined as keeping the commandments, not as an alternative to them.

No new covenant passage introduces a replacement moral law, names the Decalogue as abolished, or describes a qualitatively different moral standard taking the place of the Ten Commandments. The claim that the new covenant abolishes the moral law requires overriding the possessive pronouns, the establishment language, the Spirit-empowerment texts, and the commandment-keeping definitions -- all to insert a concept ("replacement law") that no biblical text states.

The new covenant is not less than the old -- it is more. It takes the same holy law and writes it where it can finally do its work: on the human heart, empowered by the Spirit of God.
