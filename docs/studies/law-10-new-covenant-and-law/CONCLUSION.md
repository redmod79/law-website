# Does the New Covenant Abolish or Establish the Moral Law?

## Question
Does the new covenant abolish or establish the moral law? If the new covenant writes the law on hearts, which law is being written?

## Summary Answer
The new covenant passages consistently describe God's pre-existing moral law being written on hearts by the Spirit, not a new or different law replacing the old. The possessive pronouns "MY law" (torati, Jer 31:33), "MY laws" (nomous mou, Heb 8:10; 10:16), and "MY statutes/MY judgments" (huqqay/mishpatay, Eze 36:27) identify the content as God's own law. The new covenant changes WHERE the law is located (stone to hearts), HOW obedience is achieved (human effort to Spirit-empowerment), and WHO mediates (Moses to Christ), but not WHAT law is in force.

## Key Verses
- **Jeremiah 31:33:** "I will put MY law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts."
- **Hebrews 8:10:** "I will put MY laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts."
- **Hebrews 10:16:** "I will put MY laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them."
- **Ezekiel 36:27:** "I will put MY spirit within you, and cause you to walk in MY statutes, and ye shall keep MY judgments."
- **Romans 3:31:** "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."
- **Romans 8:4:** "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
- **1 John 5:3:** "This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous."

## Evidence Classification

Evidence items tracked in law-master-evidence.md

INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by those who say the law continues, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by those who say the law is abolished, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.

### 1. Explicit Statements Table

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | God says "I will put MY law (torati, torah + 1cs suffix) in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts." The possessive "my" identifies the law as God's pre-existing law.

- **E36 (Continues):** V1: "circumcise thine heart...to love the LORD" = heart-transformation for obedience. Gate 1 PASS: love for God is the content. Gate 2 PASS. Gate 3 PASS. Gate 4 PASS: consistent with E272 in master.
- **E37, E38, E43-E46 (Neutral):** Referent of "the law" is ambiguous in Galatians passages. Heb 8:13 refers to the old covenant arrangement. Both sides accept these as textual facts. The Abolished reading requires choosing between possible meanings (Gate 1 fail for "law" in Galatians; contextual ambiguity).

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Classification | Why Unavoidable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The possessive "my" in "my law" (torati, Jer 31:33) and "my laws" (nomous mou, Heb 8:10; 10:16) identifies the new covenant law-content as God's own pre-existing law, not a new or different law. The pronoun is a lexical fact in both Hebrew and Greek. | E1, E5, E6 | Continues | Both sides must acknowledge the possessive pronoun refers to God's existing law. A scholar from either position would agree "my law" means "the law belonging to God" -- the question is which specific law, but the possessive establishes it is God's pre-existing law, not a new invention. |
| N2 | The new covenant passages specify the same law-content but a different location: the law moves from stone/external to hearts/internal. Jer 31:33 uses katab (the Decalogue-writing verb) for writing on hearts. 2 Cor 3:3 contrasts "tables of stone" with "fleshy tables of the heart." Heb 8:10 and 10:16 use epigrapso for inscribing on hearts. | E1, E5, E6, E22 | Continues | The stone-to-heart motif is textually explicit. Both sides must acknowledge the text describes the same content moving to a new location. Whether this means the Decalogue specifically requires the possessive pronouns (N1), but the relocation pattern is unavoidable. |
| N3 | Hebrews 10:1-18 simultaneously removes the sacrificial system (vv.1-9, 18: "no more offering for sin") and affirms God writing "my laws" on hearts (v.16). Within the same passage, ceremonial cessation and law-on-hearts affirmation coexist. | E6, E46 | Continues | Any reader can observe that vv.1-9 discuss sacrifice removal while v.16 quotes the law-on-hearts promise. The passage itself contains both elements. No additional framework is required. |
| N4 | The fault of the old covenant is placed on the PEOPLE, not on the law: "finding fault with THEM" (Heb 8:8, autous); "THEY brake MY covenant" (Jer 31:32, hemmah heferu beriti); "weak through the flesh" (Rom 8:3). Every text identifying the problem points to human inability, not law deficiency. | E2, E4; cf. master E265, E285 | Neutral | Universal agreement: both sides accept that Israel failed. The question is whether the solution is a new law or a new power to keep the same law, but both sides acknowledge the people broke the covenant. |
| N5 | The Spirit's role in the new covenant is to empower obedience to God's statutes and judgments, not to replace them. Eze 36:27 says the Spirit CAUSES walking in "my statutes" and keeping "my judgments." Rom 8:4 says the law's requirement is fulfilled IN Spirit-walkers. | E8, E10 | Continues | The text says the Spirit causes obedience to the statutes, not that the Spirit replaces the statutes. The grammatical structure (Spirit causes -> walking in statutes) is a causal chain, not a substitution. |
| N6 | Paul uses katargeo (G2673) to describe what is "done away" (Eph 2:15: "the law of commandments in ordinances") and then emphatically denies that katargeo applies to the law through faith (Rom 3:31: "God forbid: we establish the law"). The same verb, same author, applied to different referents. | E9; cf. master E262 | Neutral | Both sides must acknowledge the same verb appears in both abolition and anti-abolition contexts by the same author. This is a grammatical/textual observation. |
| N7 | Love is defined as commandment-keeping, not as an alternative to commandment-keeping. 1 John 5:3 says "this IS the love of God, that we keep his commandments." Rom 13:8-10 says love FULFILLS the law (citing Decalogue commands). | E11, E19 | Continues | The definitional equation (love = commandment-keeping) is explicit in 1 John 5:3. Rom 13:9 identifies the commandments as Decalogue content. Both passages make the equation, not the interpreter. |

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that the new covenant internalizes the same Decalogue content rather than introducing a different moral standard. | I-A | E1: "MY law" (torati) written on hearts (Jer 31:33); E5/E6: "MY laws" (nomous mou) in hearts (Heb 8:10; 10:16); E8: Spirit causes walking in "MY statutes/judgments" (Eze 36:27); E22: stone tablets to heart tablets (2 Cor 3:3); N1: possessive "my" = pre-existing law; N2: same content, different location. | The identification of "my law" specifically as the Decalogue (rather than the broader torah) requires systematizing multiple data points: the possessive pronoun (N1), the katab/Decalogue-writing connection, the stone-to-heart motif (N2), and the Deu 4:13 identification of the covenant as "ten commandments" (master E005). Each component is text-derived; only systematization (#5) is required. | #5 |
| I2 | The Bible teaches that the new covenant changes the administration (location, power, mediator, basis) while keeping the moral law constant. The law is the constant; the covenant arrangement is the variable. | I-A | E1-E6: Law written on hearts in new covenant; E8: Spirit empowers obedience to same statutes; E9: faith establishes law; E10: law's requirement fulfilled in Spirit-walkers; N2: same content, new location; N4: fault with people, not law; N5: Spirit empowers, not replaces. | Systematizes five explicit differences (location, power, mediator, blood, forgiveness -- per master N052) with the law-continuation texts into a unified claim. All components found in E/N. Only criterion #5. | #5 |
| I3 | The Bible teaches that "not under the law" (Rom 6:14; Gal 5:18) means freedom from the law's condemning jurisdiction, not freedom from moral obligation. | I-B | FOR: E16 "not under the law, but under grace" (Rom 6:14); E38 "led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law" (Gal 5:18). AGAINST: E17 "Shall we sin? God forbid" (Rom 6:15); E9 "we establish the law" (Rom 3:31); E10 law's requirement fulfilled in Spirit-walkers (Rom 8:4); E11 commandments are kept by those who love God (1 John 5:3). | Both sides cite "not under the law" but disagree on what it means. One reading: law abolished. Another reading: condemnation removed. Both derive from E/N statements. The resolution depends on how "under the law" is interpreted in the context of Rom 6:15 and Rom 8:4. | #2 (choosing between readings) |
| I4 | The Bible teaches that the new covenant abolishes the moral law (Decalogue) and replaces it with a "law of Christ" or "law of the Spirit" that is qualitatively different from the Mosaic moral law. | I-D | E1, E5, E6: text says "MY law/MY laws" written on hearts (not "a NEW law"); E8: Spirit causes obedience to "MY statutes/judgments" (not new ones); E9: "we establish the law" (not "we replace the law"); E10: "righteousness OF THE LAW" fulfilled (not a new standard); N1: possessive pronouns identify pre-existing law; N2: same content, new location; N5: Spirit empowers, not replaces. | To maintain that the moral law is abolished by the new covenant, one must override: (1) the possessive "my law/my laws" identifying God's pre-existing law; (2) Paul's emphatic "God forbid: we establish the law"; (3) the Spirit causing obedience to the same statutes; (4) the law's righteous requirement being fulfilled, not replaced. This requires adding the concept "new replacement law" which no new covenant passage states. | #1 (adding a concept), overrides E1, E5, E6, E8, E9, E10, N1, N2, N5 |
| I5 | The Bible teaches that Galatians 3:19-25 proves the moral law was temporary ("added...till the seed should come") and is no longer binding. | I-B | FOR: E43 "the law was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come" (Gal 3:19); E37 "after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster" (Gal 3:24-25). AGAINST: E44 "Is the law against the promises? God forbid" (Gal 3:21); E9 "we establish the law" (Rom 3:31, same author); E1/E5/E6 "my law" written on hearts; master E021 "till heaven and earth pass" (Mat 5:17-18); master E014 "stand fast for ever and ever" (Psa 111:7-8). | Both sides cite Galatians 3 but disagree on the referent of "the law." The "till the seed" language could refer to the moral law's existence or to its custodial/pedagogical function. The resolution depends on identifying what precisely was "added" and what terminates. | #2 (choosing between readings of "the law") |
| I6 | The Bible teaches that Hebrews 8:13 ("the first [covenant]...ready to vanish away") means the entire old covenant including the Decalogue is obsolete. | I-B | FOR: E45 "he hath made the first old...ready to vanish away" (Heb 8:13). AGAINST: E5 "MY laws" written on hearts in the SAME passage (Heb 8:10); E4 fault with "them" (Heb 8:8); N3 Heb 10:1-18 removes sacrifices while affirming law on hearts; master E276 "the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service" (Heb 9:1); master E136 "carnal ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation" (Heb 9:10). | The "vanishing" of the old covenant arrangement is stated (E45), but the same chapter writes "my laws" on hearts (E5). The claim that "vanishing" includes the Decalogue requires choosing "vanishing" over "my laws on hearts" from the same passage. | #2 (choosing which element of the passage governs) |
| I7 | The Bible teaches that the entirety of the Sinai legislation is a single indivisible unit, so abolishing the ceremonial law necessarily abolishes the moral law. | I-D | E1/E5/E6: "my law/laws" written on hearts (implying continuation); E8: Spirit causes walking in "my statutes/judgments"; E21: 1 Cor 7:19 dismisses circumcision while affirming commandments of God (in one verse); master N017: shadow/type vocabulary exclusively ceremonial; master N018: cessation vocabulary never used for Decalogue; master N047: same author abolishes dogma while denying he abolishes nomos; master N048: Eph 6:2-3 cites Decalogue as binding in same epistle as Eph 2:15. | Requires overriding: the Bible's own distinctions between categories of law (different delivery modes, media, repositories, vocabulary), Paul's simultaneous ceremonial dismissal/moral affirmation (1 Cor 7:19), and the NT's restriction of cessation vocabulary to non-Decalogue referents. | #1 (adding "indivisibility" concept the text does not contain), overrides multiple E/N items |

### I-B Resolution: I3 -- "Not under the law" meaning

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR abolition reading: E16 (Rom 6:14 "not under the law"), E38 (Gal 5:18 "not under the law")
- AGAINST abolition reading: E17 (Rom 6:15 "shall we sin? God forbid"), E9 (Rom 3:31 "we establish the law"), E10 (Rom 8:4 law fulfilled in Spirit-walkers), E11 (1 John 5:3 commandments kept)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**
| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E16 | Ambiguous | "Under the law" has a semantic range: under condemnation, under obligation, under the Mosaic system |
| E38 | Ambiguous | Same ambiguity as E16 |
| E17 | Plain | Directly and without ambiguity denies that "not under law" means freedom to sin |
| E9 | Plain | Directly states faith ESTABLISHES the law, using the strongest Greek negation |
| E10 | Plain | Directly states the law's requirement IS FULFILLED in Spirit-walkers |
| E11 | Plain | Directly defines love as keeping His commandments |

**Step 3 -- Weight:** Four Plain statements AGAINST the abolition reading; two Ambiguous statements FOR it.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:** E17 (same immediate context as E16) determines the reading of E16: "not under the law" does not mean "free to sin." E9 and E10 (same author, same epistle series) further define the new covenant relationship: law established, law fulfilled. The plain statements govern the ambiguous ones.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong toward Continues.** The "not under the law" language is interpreted by its own immediate context (Rom 6:15), by the same author's emphatic affirmation (Rom 3:31), and by the new covenant mechanism (Rom 8:4). No plain statement supports the abolition reading.

### I-B Resolution: I5 -- Galatians 3:19-25 and moral law's temporality

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR temporal reading: E43 (Gal 3:19 "till the seed"), E37 (Gal 3:24-25 "no longer under a schoolmaster")
- AGAINST temporal reading: E44 (Gal 3:21 "law against promises? God forbid"), E9 (Rom 3:31), E1/E5/E6 (law on hearts), master E021 (Mat 5:17-18 "till heaven and earth pass"), master E014 (Psa 111:7-8 "for ever and ever")

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**
| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E43 | Ambiguous | "The law" is unqualified; "added" and "till" could refer to the law's custodial function, not its existence |
| E37 | Ambiguous | "Schoolmaster" (paidagogos) describes a function, not the law's essential nature |
| E44 | Plain | Paul directly denies the law opposes God's promises |
| E9 | Plain | "We establish the law" -- same author, emphatic denial |
| E1/E5/E6 | Plain | "My law/laws on hearts" -- direct divine speech |
| E021 | Plain | "Till heaven and earth pass" -- Jesus' direct statement on law's duration |
| E014 | Plain | "Stand fast for ever and ever" -- absolute permanence |

**Step 3 -- Weight:** Five Plain statements AGAINST the temporal-abolition reading; two Ambiguous statements FOR it.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:** E021 (Mat 5:17-18, Jesus' direct didactic statement) and E9 (Rom 3:31, same author as Galatians) determine the reading of E43/E37. The schoolmaster function (bringing to Christ for justification) terminates; the law's moral authority and existence do not.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong toward Continues.** The temporal language in Galatians 3 refers to the custodial function, not the moral law's existence. Plain statements from Jesus and Paul himself govern the ambiguous Galatians passages.

### I-B Resolution: I6 -- Hebrews 8:13 and Decalogue obsolescence

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR: E45 (Heb 8:13 "made the first old...vanish away")
- AGAINST: E5 (Heb 8:10 "my laws" on hearts, SAME passage), E4 (Heb 8:8 fault with "them"), N3 (Heb 10:1-18 removes sacrifices + affirms law on hearts), master E276 (Heb 9:1 "ordinances of divine service"), master E136 (Heb 9:10 "carnal ordinances")

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**
| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E45 | Contextually Clear | The "vanishing" applies to the old covenant arrangement; the neuter participles disagree with feminine diatheke |
| E5 | Plain | Direct quotation of divine speech: "my laws on hearts" -- no ambiguity |
| E4 | Plain | Grammatical fact: autous = "them" (people), not the law |
| N3 | Plain | Observable pattern within Hebrews 10 |
| E276 | Plain | Text itself identifies first covenant's content as sanctuary service |
| E136 | Plain | "Carnal ordinances...until the time of reformation" |

**Step 3 -- Weight:** Five Plain items AGAINST the Decalogue-obsolescence reading; one Contextually Clear item FOR it (which, upon context analysis, favors the AGAINST side: same passage affirms law on hearts).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:** E5 (same chapter, v.10) determines the reading of E45 (v.13). The "vanishing" is the old covenant ARRANGEMENT (including its ceremonial system per E276, E136), not the moral law content which is being written on hearts (E5). The clear interprets the ambiguous within the same immediate context.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong toward Continues.** The Decalogue-obsolescence reading requires ignoring E5 from the SAME passage. The "vanishing" applies to the arrangement, while the moral law is relocated to hearts.

### 4. Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify Explicit Statements**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases verse text. Checked.
- E items state what the text says, not what a position infers. Checked.

**Step A2: Verify Positional Classifications**
- All Continues E-items were run through Tree 3 with all four gates. See classification rationale above.
- Neutral E-items were verified as observations both sides must accept.

**Step B: Verify Necessary Implications**
- N1: Universal agreement test -- both sides acknowledge "my" means "belonging to God." PASS.
- N2: No interpretation required -- stone-to-heart is explicitly stated. PASS.
- N3: Observable pattern in Hebrews 10 -- sacrifice removal + law-on-hearts in same passage. PASS.
- N4: Multiple texts identify fault with people. PASS.
- N5: Spirit CAUSES walking in statutes -- causal chain explicit. PASS.
- N6: Same verb in both contexts by same author -- observable grammatical fact. PASS.
- N7: 1 John 5:3 defines love as commandment-keeping -- definitional equation explicit. PASS.

**Step C: Verify Inference Source Test**
- I1, I2: All components in E/N tables. Text-derived. Correct I-A.
- I3, I5, I6: E/N items on both sides. Correct I-B.
- I4, I7: Require adding concepts not in text ("new replacement law," "indivisibility"). Correct I-D.

**Step D: Verify Inference Direction Test**
- I1, I2: No E/N statement required to mean other than lexical value. Correct I-A.
- I3, I5, I6: E/N on both sides -- competing evidence. Correct I-B.
- I4, I7: Require overriding possessive pronouns, establishment language, and categorical distinctions. Correct I-D.

**Step E: Consistency Checks**
- I1, I2: Only criterion #5. PASS for I-A.
- I3, I5, I6: E/N on both sides. PASS for I-B.
- I4, I7: Override multiple E/N statements. PASS for I-D.

**New items to add to master file:**

New E items:
- E293: "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love." Jesus identifies His commandments as His Father's. (John 15:10) -- Continues
- E294: "He that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him...by the Spirit which he hath given us." Spirit-indwelling confirmed by commandment-keeping. (1 John 3:24) -- Continues
- E295: "Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar." Knowing God verified by commandment-keeping. (1 John 2:3-4) -- Continues
- E296: "But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you." Heart-obedience = new covenant language. (Rom 6:17) -- Neutral
- E297: "Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid." Paul denies "not under law" means freedom to sin. (Rom 6:15) -- Neutral
- E298: "The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly." Grace teaches righteous living. (Tit 2:11-12) -- Neutral
- E299: "Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity (anomia), and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works." Redemption from lawlessness, not into lawlessness. (Tit 2:14) -- Neutral
- E300: "For obedience to the faith among all nations" / "Made known to all nations for the obedience of faith." Faith produces obedience (bookends of Romans). (Rom 1:5; 16:26) -- Neutral
- E301: "I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me." Everlasting covenant with heart-based fear of God. (Jer 32:40) -- Neutral
- E302: "Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid." Paul denies opposition between law and promise. (Gal 3:21a) -- Neutral

New N items:
- N053: The new covenant passages simultaneously describe ceremonial cessation and moral law continuation within the same textual units: Hebrews 10:1-18 removes sacrifices (vv.1-9, 18) while affirming "my laws" on hearts (v.16); 1 Cor 7:19 dismisses circumcision while affirming "the commandments of God." This pattern is observable across multiple authors. | E6, E46, E21; cf. master N044, N019 | Continues
- N054: Love is explicitly defined as commandment-keeping (not as a replacement for commandments) in both 1 John 5:3 ("this IS the love of God, that we keep his commandments") and Rom 13:8-10 (love FULFILLS the law by keeping Decalogue commands). Two authors independently make this equation. | E11, E19 | Continues
- N055: The Spirit's role in the new covenant is to EMPOWER obedience to God's existing statutes (Eze 36:27: "cause you to walk in MY statutes"; Rom 8:4: "righteousness of the law fulfilled in us who walk after the Spirit"), not to replace those statutes with different requirements. The causal chain is: Spirit -> obedience to statutes. | E8, E10 | Continues

New I items:
- I063: The Bible teaches that end-time (new covenant) believers are characterized by keeping "the commandments of God" (entolas tou Theou) paired with "the faith of Jesus" (Rev 14:12) and "the testimony of Jesus Christ" (Rev 12:17). This identifies the moral commandments as a continuing mark of God's people under the new covenant. Systematizes E14, E15 with E9, E11. All text-derived; only criterion #5. | I-A | Continues
- I064: The Bible teaches that "not under the law" (Rom 6:14; Gal 5:18) means freedom from the law's condemning jurisdiction and not freedom from moral obligation, because the same author emphatically denies that "not under law" permits sin (Rom 6:15), establishes the law through faith (Rom 3:31), and describes the law's requirement being fulfilled in Spirit-walkers (Rom 8:4). I-B resolved Strong toward Continues. | I-B | Continues
- I065: The Bible teaches that Galatians 3:19-25 describes the termination of the law's custodial/pedagogical function (bringing to Christ for justification), not the termination of the moral law's existence, because Jesus says the law endures "till heaven and earth pass" (Mat 5:17-18), Paul says "we establish the law" (Rom 3:31), and the new covenant writes "my laws" on hearts (Heb 8:10). I-B resolved Strong toward Continues. | I-B | Continues
- I066: The Bible teaches that Hebrews 8:13 ("the first [covenant]...ready to vanish away") refers to the old covenant arrangement (including its ceremonial system), not the Decalogue, because the same chapter writes "my laws" on hearts (Heb 8:10), Hebrews 9:1 identifies the first covenant as "ordinances of divine service," and Hebrews 9:10 calls these "carnal ordinances imposed until the time of reformation." I-B resolved Strong toward Continues. | I-B | Continues
- I067: The Bible teaches that the entire moral law (Decalogue) was abolished by the new covenant and replaced with a qualitatively different "law of Christ." This requires overriding the possessive "my law/my laws" (Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10; 10:16), Paul's "we establish the law" (Rom 3:31), the Spirit causing obedience to "my statutes/judgments" (Eze 36:27), and the law's "righteousness" being "fulfilled" (Rom 8:4). No new covenant passage introduces a replacement law. | I-D | Abolished
- I068: The entirety of the Sinai legislation is a single indivisible unit, so if ceremonial laws are abolished, the moral law (Decalogue) must be also. This requires overriding: 1 Cor 7:19 (dismisses circumcision, affirms commandments in one verse), the NT restriction of cessation vocabulary (dogma, cheirographon) to non-Decalogue referents, and Paul's same-epistle abolition of ordinances (Eph 2:15) while citing the 5th commandment as binding (Eph 6:2-3). | I-D | Abolished

### 7. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

**What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):**
- God's new covenant promise places "MY law" (torati / nomous mou) on hearts -- God's own pre-existing law (Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10; 10:16)
- The possessive pronouns in Hebrew and Greek identify the law-content as God's existing law, not a new law
- The verb katab used for writing on hearts is the same verb used for writing the Decalogue on stone (Exo 31:18)
- The fault of the old covenant is with the PEOPLE (Heb 8:8 autous; Jer 31:32 hemmah), not with the law
- The Spirit's role is to CAUSE obedience to God's statutes and judgments (Eze 36:27), not to replace them
- Faith ESTABLISHES the law (Rom 3:31) -- Paul emphatically denies faith nullifies the law
- The law's righteous requirement is FULFILLED in Spirit-walking believers (Rom 8:4)
- Love is DEFINED as keeping God's commandments (1 John 5:3; Rom 13:8-10)
- End-time saints are characterized by keeping "the commandments of God" and having "the faith of Jesus" (Rev 14:12)
- Hebrews 10:1-18 simultaneously removes the sacrificial system (vv.1-9, 18) and affirms God writing "my laws" on hearts (v.16)
- The new covenant is called "everlasting" (Heb 13:20)
- Paul uses katargeo to abolish "the law of commandments in ordinances" (Eph 2:15) while emphatically denying katargeo applies to "the law" through faith (Rom 3:31) -- indicating a distinction in referents

**What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):**
- That the new covenant introduces a different moral standard replacing the Decalogue -- no new covenant passage states this
- That "my law" (torati) in Jeremiah 31:33 means something other than God's pre-existing law -- the possessive pronoun prevents this reading
- That "not under the law" (Rom 6:14) means freedom from moral obligation -- the immediate context denies this (Rom 6:15)
- That the moral law was abolished at the cross -- no abolition passage identifies the Decalogue as the thing abolished (per master N043)
- That Hebrews 8:13 ("vanishing away") includes the moral law -- the same chapter writes "my laws" on hearts (Heb 8:10)
- That the law and grace are opposites -- Paul denies law opposes promises (Gal 3:21) and says faith establishes law (Rom 3:31)
- That any specific new set of commands replaces the Decalogue in the new covenant -- no passage names such a replacement
- That "the law was added till the seed should come" (Gal 3:19) means the moral law ceases to exist -- Jesus says "till heaven and earth pass" (Mat 5:17-18), and Paul says "we establish the law" (Rom 3:31)

## Conclusion

Across the new covenant passages examined in this study, the consistent textual pattern is: the same moral law, different administrative framework. The possessive pronouns ("my law," "my laws," "my statutes," "my judgments") in both Hebrew and Greek identify the content written on hearts as God's own pre-existing law. The stone-to-heart motif (Jer 31:33; 2 Cor 3:3; Heb 8:10; 10:16) describes relocation, not replacement. The Spirit-empowerment motif (Eze 36:27; Rom 8:4) describes divine enablement of obedience to the same standard, not introduction of a new standard.

The Continues position draws on 26 Explicit statements, 5 Necessary Implications, and 2 I-A inferences from this study. The Abolished position's claims about the new covenant abolishing the moral law are classified as I-D (Counter-Evidence External), requiring overriding multiple explicit texts (possessive pronouns, establishment language, Spirit-empowered obedience to named statutes). All four I-B items were resolved Strong toward Continues by SIS: Plain statements from Jesus, Paul, and the Hebrews author govern the reading of ambiguous passages.

No new covenant passage introduces a replacement moral law, names the Decalogue as abolished, or describes a qualitatively different moral standard. The new covenant changes location (stone to hearts), power source (human effort to Spirit), mediator (Moses to Christ), ratification blood (animal to Christ's), and forgiveness scope (limited to complete). The moral law content remains constant across the covenant transition.
