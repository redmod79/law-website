## Question
Does the new covenant abolish or establish the moral law? If the new covenant writes the law on hearts, which law is being written?

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Jeremiah 31:31-34 -- The New Covenant Promise

**Context:** God speaks through Jeremiah during the period before the Babylonian exile. The surrounding context (31:27-37) includes promises of restoration, individual responsibility (vv.29-30), and the permanence of Israel compared to cosmic ordinances (vv.35-37). This is a prophetic oracle ("saith the LORD" appears four times in four verses) with future-oriented language.

**Direct statement (v.31):** God will make (karath, "cut") a new covenant (berit hadashah) with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. The same verb (karath) used for the Sinai covenant (Deu 5:2-3) is used for the new covenant -- the method of establishment is parallel.

**Direct statement (v.32):** This covenant is "not according to" (lo' kabberit) the covenant made with the fathers at the Exodus. The emphatic pronoun hemmah ("THEY themselves") places the blame on the people: "they brake MY covenant." The Hebrew parsing confirms beriti (possessive suffix, 1st person singular) -- God claims the covenant as His own. The people broke it; the covenant/law itself was not defective.

**Direct statement (v.33):** God will put "MY law" (torati -- torah with 1st person singular suffix) in their inward parts (beqirbam) and write it on their hearts (libbam). Critical grammatical observations:
1. The word is **torah** (H8451) -- the standard word for the Mosaic law and the Decalogue.
2. The possessive suffix identifies this as GOD'S existing law, not a new law.
3. The 3rd feminine singular suffix on 'ektebenah ("I will write IT") refers back to torah (feminine) -- it is THIS specific law being written.
4. The verb katab ("write") is the SAME verb used for God writing the Decalogue on stone (Exo 31:18; 34:1).
5. The text does NOT say "I will give a NEW law." It says "I will put MY [existing] law in their inward parts."

**Direct statement (v.34):** Three new covenant provisions: (1) universal knowledge of God -- "they shall all know me"; (2) forgiveness of iniquity; (3) sins not remembered. The new covenant addresses past law-breaking through forgiveness, not by abolishing the law.

**Key observations:** The possessive "my law" (torati) is the decisive linguistic marker. It identifies the content of the new covenant as God's pre-existing law relocated to a new medium (hearts instead of stone). The verb katab connects the heart-writing to the Decalogue stone-writing. The three provisions are: internal law, universal knowledge, complete forgiveness.

**Cross-references:** Heb 8:10 and 10:16 directly quote this passage, using nomous mou ("my laws") with the same possessive construction. 2 Cor 3:3 contrasts "tables of stone" with "fleshy tables of the heart," using the same stone/heart motif.

---

### Hebrews 8:6-13 -- The Better Covenant

**Context:** The author of Hebrews has been arguing that Jesus is a superior high priest (chapters 7-8). Hebrews 8:6 transitions to the new covenant as the basis of Christ's more excellent ministry.

**Direct statement (v.6):** Christ is the mediator of a "better covenant" (kreittonos diathekes) established upon "better promises" (kreittosin epangeliais). The covenant is better; the promises are better.

**Direct statement (v.7):** If the first covenant had been "faultless" (amemptos), no place would be sought for a second. The fault is addressed in the next verse.

**Direct statement (v.8):** "Finding fault with THEM" (memphomenos...autous). The Greek parsing is definitive: autous is accusative plural masculine -- the object of blame is the PEOPLE, not the covenant or the law. The grammar forces this reading.

**Direct statement (vv.9-10):** The author quotes Jer 31:31-33 in Greek. The key phrase nomous mou ("MY laws," accusative plural + possessive genitive) preserves the Hebrew possessive construction. The verb epigrapso ("I will inscribe," future active indicative, 1st singular) has God as the active agent who inscribes the laws. The laws go into the mind (dianoian) AND upon the hearts (kardias).

**Direct statement (v.13):** "In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away." What is "vanishing away" is the old covenant arrangement (the administrative framework), not the law content. The neuter participles (palaioumenon, geraskon) do not agree with diatheke (feminine), as noted in law-09.

**Key observations:** The fault is with the people (v.8 grammar), not with the law. The new covenant writes "my laws" (God's pre-existing laws) on hearts. The old covenant ARRANGEMENT is what vanishes, while the law CONTENT is what gets relocated.

---

### Hebrews 10:15-18 -- The Holy Spirit's Witness

**Context:** Hebrews 10:1-14 argues that animal sacrifices could never perfect the worshiper (v.1), that Christ's single offering accomplishes what repeated sacrifices could not (vv.10-14). Then v.15 introduces the Holy Spirit's testimony.

**Direct statement (v.15):** "The Holy Ghost also is a witness to us." The Spirit testified through Jeremiah's prophecy -- asserting divine authorship of the new covenant promise.

**Direct statement (v.16):** Quotes Jer 31:33 again: "I will put MY laws (nomous mou) into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them (epigrapso autous)." The same possessive "my" and the same inscription language.

**Direct statement (v.18):** "Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin." The passage concludes by removing the sacrificial system (no more offering) while affirming the law on hearts (v.16).

**Key observations:** Hebrews 10 simultaneously removes the sacrificial/ceremonial system (vv.1-9, 18) and affirms God writing "my laws" on hearts (v.16). Within the same argument, ceremonial cessation and moral law continuation coexist. This is a passage where both law categories appear in their respective fates.

---

### Ezekiel 36:26-27 -- New Heart and Spirit

**Context:** God addresses the exiled Israelites (36:16-32). He acts "for mine holy name's sake" (v.22), not for Israel's merit. He sprinkles clean water (v.25), gives a new heart and spirit (v.26-27), and they dwell in the land (v.28). They will loathe themselves for past sins (v.31).

**Direct statement (v.26):** Three divine actions: (1) give a new heart (leb hadash); (2) give a new spirit (ruah hadashah) within them; (3) remove the heart of stone (leb ha'eben) and give a heart of flesh (leb basar). All verbs have God as subject -- entirely divine initiative.

**Direct statement (v.27):** God will put "MY Spirit" (ruhi, with 1st person suffix) within them and CAUSE (we'asiti, from 'asah) them to walk in "MY statutes" (behuqqay, with 1st person suffix) and keep "MY judgments" (umishpatay, with 1st person suffix). Three verbs of obedience follow: walk (halak), keep (shamar), do ('asah).

**Key observations:**
1. The stone-to-flesh heart transformation parallels the stone-tablets-to-heart-tablets motif: the SAME law that was on stone is now inscribed on the responsive heart.
2. Every possessive pronoun points to God: MY spirit, MY statutes, MY judgments.
3. The terms huqqim (statutes) and mishpatim (judgments) are standard Pentateuchal terms for God's laws -- the SAME terms used throughout Exodus-Deuteronomy.
4. The Spirit does NOT replace the statutes/judgments; the Spirit EMPOWERS obedience to them.
5. God is the cause of the obedience (we'asiti = "I will cause") -- the power source shifts from human effort to divine enablement.

**Cross-references:** Eze 11:19-20 is a parallel passage with nearly identical language: new heart, new spirit, walk in "my statutes," keep "mine ordinances." The parallels with OT law-keeping passages are strong: Lev 26:3 ("If ye walk in my statutes"), Deu 8:6 ("to walk in his ways"), Eze 20:19 ("Walk in my statutes").

---

### Romans 3:31 -- Faith Establishes Law

**Context:** Paul has argued that all have sinned (3:23), justification is by grace through faith (3:24), and God is just in justifying the believer (3:26). In v.28 he states justification is "by faith without the deeds of the law." Then he asks whether this nullifies the law.

**Direct statement:** "Do we then make void (katargoumen, G2673) the law through faith? God forbid (me genoito): yea, we establish (histanomen, G2476) the law."

**Key observations:**
1. Katargoumen is the same root (katargeo, G2673) used in 2 Cor 3:7, 11, 13 for what is "done away" and in Eph 2:15 for what is "abolished." Paul uses this very word and emphatically DENIES that it applies to the law through faith.
2. Me genoito is the strongest possible Greek negation -- "May it never be!" An emphatic, horrified rejection.
3. Histanomen (histemi, G2476) means "we establish / make stand." Faith causes the law to STAND, not to fall.
4. Nomon is anarthrous (no article) in both occurrences, suggesting law as a principle or institution.
5. This verse directly answers the study question: faith-based new covenant theology ESTABLISHES the law, not abolishes it.

**Cross-references:** Rom 8:4 immediately demonstrates HOW faith establishes the law -- by the Spirit fulfilling the law's righteous requirement in believers. This is the mechanism of Eze 36:27.

---

### Romans 8:1-4 -- Law Fulfilled in Spirit-Walkers

**Context:** Paul has just described the struggle with sin in chapter 7, concluding with "O wretched man that I am!" (7:24). Chapter 8 opens with the solution: no condemnation in Christ Jesus.

**Direct statement (v.1):** No condemnation for those in Christ Jesus who walk after the Spirit.

**Direct statement (v.2):** "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death." Freedom is from the law OF SIN AND DEATH (the principle of sin's dominion), not from the moral law itself.

**Direct statement (v.3):** "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh" -- the limitation is in the FLESH, not in the law. God sent His Son to condemn sin in the flesh.

**Direct statement (v.4):** "That THE RIGHTEOUSNESS (to dikaioma, singular with article) OF THE LAW (tou nomou, with article) might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."

**Key observations:**
1. To dikaioma (G1345) is SINGULAR with the article = "the specific righteous requirement." Not scattered regulations but the law's unified moral demand.
2. Plerothe is aorist passive subjunctive = "might be fulfilled." The PASSIVE voice means God fulfills it in believers, not that believers achieve it by human power.
3. The purpose clause (hina) connects to v.3: God sent Christ SO THAT the law's requirement would be fulfilled.
4. Kata pneuma ("according to Spirit") parallels Eze 36:27's Spirit-empowered obedience.
5. The law is not abolished but FULFILLED in Spirit-walking believers -- the new covenant mechanism in action.

---

### 1 John 5:2-3 -- Love Defined as Commandment-Keeping

**Context:** John has been discussing love throughout the epistle (2:3-6; 3:22-24; 4:19-21). Now he defines what love for God IS.

**Direct statement (v.2):** "By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments (tas entolas autou)."

**Direct statement (v.3):** "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments (tas entolas autou): and his commandments (hai entolai autou) are not grievous (bareiai ouk eisin)."

**Key observations:**
1. Love for God is DEFINED as keeping His commandments -- not an alternative to commandments.
2. The possessive pronoun autou ("His") appears three times -- these are God's own commandments.
3. Entole (G1785) is the same word used for the Decalogue throughout John's writings (John 14:15, 21; 15:10; 1 John 2:3-4; 3:22-24).
4. "Not grievous" (bareiai ouk eisin) directly addresses the new covenant reality: Spirit-empowerment makes obedience non-burdensome.
5. The present subjunctive teromen ("we should keep") indicates ongoing, continuous keeping.

**Cross-references:** John 14:15 ("If ye love me, keep my commandments") uses the same love-commandment equation. Rev 12:17 and 14:12 describe end-time saints by keeping "the commandments of God" -- using entole tou Theou, the same construction.

---

### Ezekiel 11:19-20 -- Earlier Parallel to Eze 36:26-27

**Context:** God addresses the exiles through Ezekiel, promising restoration. This passage precedes the more detailed Eze 36 parallel.

**Direct statement (v.19):** "I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh."

**Direct statement (v.20):** "That they may walk in MY statutes, and keep MINE ordinances, and do them." The purpose of the new heart is obedience to God's pre-existing laws.

**Key observations:** The stone-heart/flesh-heart motif appears here as in Eze 36:26. The PURPOSE CLAUSE ("that they may walk in my statutes") identifies the goal of heart-renewal: obedience to the same statutes and ordinances already given. The possessive pronouns confirm these are God's existing laws.

---

### John 14:15, 21 and 15:10 -- Love and Commandments

**Context:** The Upper Room Discourse, the night before Jesus' crucifixion -- the same night He institutes the new covenant in His blood (Luke 22:20).

**Direct statement (14:15):** "If ye love me, keep MY commandments (tas entolas tas emas)."

**Direct statement (14:21):** "He that hath MY commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me."

**Direct statement (15:10):** "If ye keep MY commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept MY FATHER'S commandments, and abide in his love."

**Key observations:**
1. Jesus speaks of "my commandments" as already given, not as something new being introduced.
2. In 15:10, Jesus equates His commandments with His FATHER'S commandments, identifying them as the same standard He Himself kept.
3. These statements occur on the night the new covenant is instituted, placing commandment-keeping squarely within the new covenant framework.
4. The possessive "my" (emas) and "my Father's" point to divine origin.

---

### Revelation 12:17 and 14:12 -- End-Time Commandment Keepers

**Context:** Apocalyptic vision describing the dragon's war against God's people (12:17) and the patience of the saints (14:12).

**Direct statement (12:17):** The remnant "keep the commandments of God (tas entolas tou Theou), and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."

**Direct statement (14:12):** "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God (tas entolas tou Theou), and the faith of Jesus."

**Key observations:**
1. End-time saints are defined by TWO marks: keeping God's commandments AND having faith in Jesus. These are not alternatives but companions.
2. Entolas tou Theou ("commandments of God") uses the same construction as 1 Cor 7:19, where Paul distinguishes circumcision (ceremonial) from "the commandments of God" (moral).
3. "The faith of Jesus" (ten pistin Iesou) paired with commandment-keeping parallels the new covenant pattern: faith and obedience together.

---

### Romans 6:14-18 -- Not Under Law, Under Grace

**Context:** Paul addresses whether believers should continue in sin (6:1). He argues that those who died with Christ in baptism should walk in newness of life (6:4).

**Direct statement (v.14):** "Sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace."

**Direct statement (v.15):** "Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid."

**Direct statement (vv.16-18):** Servants of obedience lead to righteousness; freed from sin, servants of righteousness.

**Key observations:**
1. "Not under the law" is followed immediately by "Shall we sin? God forbid" -- Paul denies that "not under the law" means freedom to sin.
2. The phrase "under the law" (hypo nomon) describes a relational condition -- under the law's condemnation/jurisdiction -- not the absence of moral obligation.
3. v.17 says they "obeyed from the heart" (hypekousate ek kardias) -- this is new covenant language: heart-level obedience, not external compliance alone.
4. Being "under grace" does not mean being without law but being under a different power dynamic -- the Spirit rather than the flesh.

---

### Titus 2:11-14 -- Grace Teaches Righteous Living

**Context:** Paul instructs Titus regarding teaching in the churches.

**Direct statement (v.11):** Grace has appeared to all men.

**Direct statement (v.12):** Grace teaches us to live "soberly, righteously (dikaios), and godly (eusebos), in this present world."

**Direct statement (v.14):** Christ redeems from "all iniquity" (anomia -- literally "lawlessness") and purifies a people "zealous of good works."

**Key observations:**
1. Grace does not teach lawlessness; it teaches sober, righteous, godly living -- terms that echo moral law standards.
2. The word anomia ("iniquity/lawlessness") in v.14 presupposes a nomos (law) that defines what is lawless. Redemption is FROM lawlessness, not INTO lawlessness.
3. The new covenant pattern: grace provides the power (Spirit); the moral law provides the standard.

---

### Matthew 5:17-19 -- Not Come to Destroy

**Context:** The Sermon on the Mount, early in Jesus' ministry. *(Examined in depth in law-01 and law-08.)*

**Direct statement (v.17):** "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."

**Direct statement (v.18):** "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."

**Direct statement (v.19):** Teaching and doing the commandments determines standing in the kingdom.

**Key observations:** Jesus explicitly denies coming to destroy the law, sets its duration until heaven and earth pass, and makes commandment-keeping a kingdom criterion. This is directly relevant to the new covenant question: if Jesus inaugurates the new covenant, and He says He did not come to destroy the law, the new covenant does not destroy the law.

---

### Luke 16:17 -- Law Easier than Heaven/Earth

**Direct statement:** "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."

**Key observations:** Parallel to Mat 5:18. The law's permanence is compared to the permanence of heaven and earth -- and the law is declared MORE enduring.

---

### Romans 7:7, 12, 14, 22 -- The Law's Character

**Context:** Paul discusses the relationship between law and sin. *(Examined in depth in law-01 and law-08.)*

**Direct statement (v.7):** Paul identifies the law by the 10th commandment ("Thou shalt not covet") -- the Decalogue.

**Direct statement (v.12):** "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."

**Direct statement (v.14):** "The law is spiritual."

**Direct statement (v.22):** "I delight in the law of God after the inward man."

**Key observations:** Paul, writing under the new covenant, calls the Decalogue "holy, just, good, spiritual" and says he delights in it "after the inward man." This is a new covenant believer describing the law in positive terms and delighting in it internally -- exactly what the new covenant promises: law on the heart.

---

### Romans 13:8-10 -- Love Fulfills the Law

**Direct statement:** Paul quotes five Decalogue commandments (adultery, kill, steal, false witness, covet) and says love is "the fulfilling of the law."

**Key observations:** Love does not replace the law; love FULFILLS it. The specific commandments Paul cites are all from the Decalogue -- moral law. Love is the principle that animates obedience, not a substitute for it. This parallels 1 John 5:3's definition of love as commandment-keeping.

---

### James 1:25; 2:8-12 -- The Royal Law of Liberty

**Direct statement (1:25):** "The perfect law of liberty" -- the law is called both "perfect" and a "law of liberty."

**Direct statement (2:8-12):** James cites "Thou shalt love thy neighbour" as "the royal law" (nomon basilikon), then cites the 6th and 7th commandments (2:11) as examples. Believers will be "judged by the law of liberty."

**Key observations:** James names specific Decalogue commandments as part of this continuing "law of liberty." The law is not bondage but liberty -- consistent with the new covenant internalization. Being "judged by the law of liberty" indicates the moral law's ongoing juridical function.

---

### 1 Corinthians 7:19 -- Circumcision vs. Commandments

**Direct statement:** "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."

**Key observations:** Paul dismisses a ceremonial rite (circumcision = "nothing") while simultaneously affirming "the keeping of the commandments of God" (entole tou Theou). This is a single verse that distinguishes ceremonial cessation from moral continuation -- within the new covenant context.

---

### Galatians 3:19-25 -- The Law's Pedagogical Function

**Context:** Paul argues about the relationship between law and promise. *(Examined in depth in law-08 and law-09.)*

**Direct statement (v.19):** "The law was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come."

**Direct statement (v.24-25):** "The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ...after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."

**Key observations:**
1. "Added" and "till the seed should come" have been cited as evidence of temporary law. The referent of "the law" is ambiguous (see Gate 1 of Tree 3).
2. v.21 asks "Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid" -- Paul denies opposition between law and promise.
3. v.24-25 describes the pedagogical function ("schoolmaster" = paidagogos) as temporal, not the law's moral authority.
4. The custodial function changes; the law's existence and moral standard do not.

---

### Galatians 5:14, 16, 18, 22-23 -- Spirit and Law

**Direct statement (v.14):** "All the law is fulfilled in one word...Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."

**Direct statement (v.16):** "Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh."

**Direct statement (v.18):** "If ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law."

**Direct statement (vv.22-23):** "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace...against such there is no law."

**Key observations:** Walking in the Spirit produces fruit that ALIGNS with the law (v.23: "against such there is no law"). The Spirit does not produce law-breaking but law-fulfilling character. "Not under the law" in v.18 parallels Rom 6:14 -- not under condemnation, not free from moral obligation.

---

### 2 Corinthians 3:3, 6 -- Stone Tablets to Heart Tablets

**Context:** Paul describes his ministry of the new covenant. *(Examined in depth in law-08 and law-09.)*

**Direct statement (v.3):** "Not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart." The explicit mention of "tables of stone" (plaxin lithinais) is an allusion to the Decalogue tablets (Exo 31:18; 34:1).

**Direct statement (v.6):** "The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life."

**Key observations:**
1. The contrast in v.3 is between MEDIUM and LOCATION, not CONTENT. The same content moves from stone to heart.
2. In v.6, "the letter" (gramma) = the external code without the Spirit's power; "the spirit" (pneuma) = the Spirit who empowers obedience. It is NOT "law vs. no-law" but "external code without power vs. Spirit-empowered internalization."
3. Engrapho (G1449, "write in/inscribe") in the perfect passive participle indicates a completed action with continuing result -- the law written on hearts is a permanent reality.

---

### Hebrews 7:11-12, 18-22 -- Change of Priesthood/Law

**Context:** The entire chapter discusses the change from Levitical to Melchizedekian priesthood. *(Examined in depth in law-04 and law-08.)*

**Direct statement (v.12):** "The priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law."

**Direct statement (v.18):** "A disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof."

**Key observations:** The "law" that changes in v.12 is the law governing the Levitical priesthood. The "commandment" disannulled in v.18 is the "law of a carnal commandment" (v.16) -- the regulation of priestly succession. The context identifies these as ceremonial/priestly, not moral law.

---

### Hebrews 13:20-21 -- The Everlasting Covenant

**Direct statement:** "The blood of the everlasting covenant" -- the new covenant is called "everlasting" (aionios).

**Key observations:** If the new covenant is everlasting, and its content includes God's law written on hearts (Heb 8:10; 10:16), then the law on hearts is an everlasting provision. The everlasting nature of the covenant confirms the permanence of its moral content.

---

### Psalm 37:31, 40:8 -- Law in the Heart (OT Precedent)

**Direct statement (37:31):** "The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide."

**Direct statement (40:8):** "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart."

**Key observations:** The experience of God's law within the heart was already a reality for faithful OT individuals. The new covenant UNIVERSALIZES what was already true for the faithful remnant. The same vocabulary ("thy law...within my heart") anticipates Jer 31:33.

---

### Psalm 19:7-11 -- The Law's Perfection

**Direct statement (vv.7-9):** The law is "perfect," the testimony is "sure," the statutes are "right," the commandment is "pure," the fear of the LORD is "clean, enduring for ever," the judgments are "true and righteous altogether."

**Key observations:** Every attribute of the law in Psalm 19 describes permanent, positive moral qualities. "Enduring for ever" (v.9) sets the temporal scope at eternity. These attributes are incompatible with abolition.

---

### Psalm 111:7-8 -- Commandments Stand Forever

**Direct statement:** "All his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness."

**Key observations:** "For ever and ever" (le'ad la'olam) is the strongest Hebrew temporal expression for perpetuity. The commandments' permanence is stated in absolute terms.

---

### Deuteronomy 6:5-6 and 30:6, 10-14 -- Heart Obedience

**Direct statement (6:5-6):** "Thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart...these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart."

**Direct statement (30:6):** "The LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart...to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart."

**Key observations:** Even within the old covenant, God commanded heart-internalization (6:6) and promised divine heart-transformation (30:6). The new covenant accomplishes what the old covenant commanded but the people lacked the heart to perform (Deu 5:29; 29:4).

---

### Romans 1:5 and 16:26 -- Obedience of Faith

**Direct statement (1:5):** "For obedience to the faith among all nations."

**Direct statement (16:26):** "Made known to all nations for the obedience of faith."

**Key observations:** The phrase "obedience of faith" (hupakoe pisteos) forms a bookend for the entire epistle of Romans. Faith produces obedience, not lawlessness. The new covenant, which operates by faith, is oriented toward obedience -- not toward the abolition of the moral standard.

---

### Everlasting Covenant Passages (Gen 17:7; Isa 54:10; 55:3; Jer 32:40; Eze 37:26)

**Direct statements:** Multiple passages describe God's covenant as "everlasting" (olam) and permanent.

**Key observations:** The concept of an everlasting covenant with a permanent moral standard is consistent throughout the OT. The new covenant is explicitly called "everlasting" in Heb 13:20. Its moral content (the law on hearts) shares this permanence.

---

### 1 John 2:3-4 and 3:22-24 -- Knowing God = Keeping Commandments

**Direct statement (2:3):** "Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments."

**Direct statement (2:4):** "He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."

**Direct statement (3:24):** "He that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him...by the Spirit which he hath given us."

**Key observations:** Knowing God is verified by commandment-keeping (2:3). Claiming to know God without keeping commandments is called a lie (2:4). The Spirit confirms the indwelling of those who keep commandments (3:24). This connects the Spirit (new covenant agent) with commandment-keeping (new covenant content).

---

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Possessive Pronouns Identify Pre-Existing Law
Across both testaments and in both Hebrew and Greek, the new covenant passages use possessive pronouns that identify the law as God's own pre-existing law:
- "MY law" (torati, Jer 31:33)
- "MY Spirit...MY statutes...MY judgments" (ruhi, huqqay, mishpatay, Eze 36:27)
- "MY laws" (nomous mou, Heb 8:10; 10:16)
- "HIS commandments" (entolas autou, 1 John 5:3)
- "MY commandments" (entolas emas, John 14:15)
- "Commandments OF GOD" (entolas tou Theou, Rev 12:17; 14:12)

No new covenant passage introduces commandments from a different source or describes a new set of commands replacing the old.

### Pattern 2: Same Law, New Location
Every new covenant passage describes the law CONTINUING in a new location/mode rather than being replaced:
- Stone to hearts (Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10; 10:16; 2 Cor 3:3)
- External to internal (Eze 36:26-27; Deu 30:6, 14)
- Letter to Spirit (2 Cor 3:6; Rom 8:4)
- Human effort to divine enablement (Eze 36:27; Rom 8:4)

### Pattern 3: New Covenant = Same Standard, Different Power
The old covenant demanded obedience but could not supply the power (Deu 5:29; 29:4; Rom 8:3). The new covenant supplies the power through the Spirit:
- "I will CAUSE you to walk in my statutes" (Eze 36:27)
- "The righteousness of the law FULFILLED IN US who walk after the Spirit" (Rom 8:4)
- "His commandments are NOT GRIEVOUS" (1 John 5:3)
- "Obeyed FROM THE HEART" (Rom 6:17)

### Pattern 4: Faith Establishes, Not Abolishes
Paul's emphatic me genoito ("God forbid!") in Rom 3:31 is reinforced across the NT:
- Faith establishes law (Rom 3:31)
- Spirit-walking fulfills law's requirement (Rom 8:4)
- Love fulfills law (Rom 13:8-10; Gal 5:14)
- Commandment-keeping defines love (1 John 5:3)
- End-time saints keep commandments AND have faith (Rev 14:12)

### Pattern 5: Ceremonial Cessation Within New Covenant Texts
Several passages that discuss the new covenant simultaneously remove ceremonial provisions while affirming moral continuity:
- Heb 10:1-18: sacrifices removed (vv.1-9, 18), law written on hearts (v.16)
- 2 Cor 3:3-6: stone tablets to heart tablets (v.3), ministration of the spirit surpasses (v.6)
- 1 Cor 7:19: circumcision dismissed, commandments of God affirmed

## Connections Between Passages

### The Jeremiah 31-Hebrews 8-10-2 Corinthians 3 Chain
Jeremiah 31:33 is quoted verbatim in Hebrews 8:10 and 10:16, and alluded to in 2 Corinthians 3:3. This creates a verified textual chain (SIS #4a) across OT and NT, across two different NT authors (Hebrews author and Paul). All four passages use the same stone-to-heart motif with possessive pronouns identifying God's law.

### The Ezekiel 36-Romans 8 Chain
Eze 36:27 promises the Spirit will CAUSE walking in God's statutes. Rom 8:4 says the Spirit FULFILLS the law's righteous requirement in believers. Both describe Spirit-empowered obedience to the same moral standard. The connection is verified by shared concepts: Spirit as agent, law as standard, believers as recipients.

### The John-1 John-Revelation Chain
John 14:15 ("keep my commandments"), 1 John 5:3 ("this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments"), and Rev 14:12 ("keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus") form a progression from Jesus' instruction through John's definition to the eschatological fulfillment. Same author, same vocabulary (entole), same love-commandment theology.

### The Romans 3:31-Galatians 3:21 Anti-Opposition Chain
Rom 3:31 denies faith makes the law void. Gal 3:21 denies the law is "against the promises of God." Both are from Paul, both use me genoito, and both deny any opposition between faith/promise and law.

## Word Study Insights

### Torah (H8451) in Jeremiah 31:33
The word torati ("MY law") uses the standard term for both the comprehensive Mosaic legislation and the Decalogue. The possessive suffix identifies it as God's own law. The same verb katab ("write") used for God writing on stone (Exo 31:18) is used for God writing on hearts.

### Engrapho (G1449) and Epigrapho (G1924) -- Inscription Verbs
Two related but distinct verbs describe the heart-writing: engrapho ("write in," 2 Cor 3:3) and epigrapho ("write upon," Heb 8:10; 10:16). Both describe permanent inscription. The perfect tense of engrapho in 2 Cor 3:3 (engegramene) signals completed action with continuing result.

### Katargeo (G2673) in Rom 3:31 vs. Eph 2:15
The same verb is used to abolish "the law of commandments in ordinances" (Eph 2:15) and to ask whether faith makes the law void (Rom 3:31). Paul emphatically denies katargeo applies to the law through faith. The same author using the same verb abolishes one referent (dogma-qualified) while denying abolition of another (the law).

### Dikaioma (G1345) in Rom 8:4
The singular use with the article ("THE righteous requirement OF THE law") points to a unified moral standard, not scattered regulations. The PASSIVE voice means God fulfills it in believers through the Spirit.

## Difficult Passages

### Galatians 3:19-25 -- "Till the seed should come"
The temporal language ("added...till the seed") appears to place the law in a limited timeframe. The referent of "the law" is genuinely ambiguous. If moral law, the temporal limit conflicts with Mat 5:17-18, Psa 111:7-8, and Rom 3:31. The passage may refer to the custodial/pedagogical function of the law (bringing to Christ) rather than the law's existence or moral authority. Paul himself says "Is the law against the promises? God forbid" (v.21), indicating the law has a continuing positive role.

### Galatians 5:18 -- "Not under the law"
"If ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law." This could mean freedom from the law entirely, or freedom from the law's condemning power. The context (v.14: "all the law fulfilled in love"; v.23: "against such there is no law") suggests the Spirit-led life aligns with the law's requirements rather than opposing them.

### Hebrews 8:13 -- "Ready to vanish away"
The "vanishing" of the old covenant is cited as evidence that the entire system (including moral law) is obsolete. The context, however, focuses on the covenant ARRANGEMENT. Heb 8:10 in the same passage affirms "my laws" written on hearts. The neuter participles do not agree grammatically with diatheke (feminine). The vanishing concerns the administrative framework, not the moral content.

### Romans 6:14 -- "Not under the law, but under grace"
The phrase "not under the law" could be read as abolition. But v.15 immediately says "Shall we sin because we are not under the law? God forbid." The phrase describes a relational change (from condemnation to grace) rather than the removal of moral obligation.
