## Question
Does the new covenant abolish or establish the moral law? Specifically, do the new covenant promises in Jeremiah 31:33, Hebrews 8:10, Hebrews 10:16, and Ezekiel 36:26-27 indicate that the moral law (Ten Commandments) is written on believers' hearts and thus continues, or do they replace the old law with something entirely new?

## Topics

### COVENANT
Nave's identifies the Mosaic law as "called a covenant" (Exo 34:28) and lists "Of the Ten Commandments" (Exo 34:28; Deut 5:2,3; 9:9) as a specific covenant instance. The covenant is described as: Sacred (Jos 9:18-21), Binding (Gal 3:15), Everlasting (Gen 8:20-22; 9:1-17; Psa 105:8,10; Isa 54:10; 61:8), and God is faithful to it (Lev 26:44,45; Deut 4:31; 7:8,9; Psa 105:8-11; 111:5).

Key distinction: "THE SECOND COVENANT" is listed separately with references Jer 31:31-34; Heb 8:4-13; 12:18-24; 13:20. The entry also notes the covenant was "Broken by the Jews" (Jer 22:9; Eze 16:59; Heb 8:9) and "Repudiated by God on account of Jews' idolatry" (Jer 44:26,27; Heb 8:9).

### COMMANDMENTS
Nave's lists the Decalogue references (Exo 13:8-10; 20:3-17; Deut 5:6-21; 6:4-9) alongside NT commandment-keeping passages: John 14:11,15,23,24; 15:2,4,5,7-12,14,17. Paul's commandment precepts include Rom 12-13; Gal 5:1,16. Other apostles' precepts include James 2:1-4,8-12 and 1 John 2:15,28; 3:10-23; 5:21; Rev 3:11,18,19. The entry connects commandments across both testaments without indicating discontinuity in the moral commandments.

### LAW
Nave's organizes the LAW topic with several key subsections:

1. **General scriptures** include both OT and NT: Psa 19:7-9; Rom 2:14,15; 7:7,12,14; 13:10; 1 Tim 1:5,8-10; James 1:25; **1 John 3:4** ("sin is the transgression of the law"); **1 John 5:3**.

2. **OF MOSES**: Given at Sinai, engraved on stone, preserved in the ark, with divine authority. This section treats the law as a unified body.

3. **TEMPORARY section**: Lists Jer 3:16; Dan 9:27; Mat 5:17-45; Luk 16:16,17; Joh 1:17; Rom 7:1-6; 8:3; 10:4; 2 Cor 3:7-14; Gal 2:3-9; 4:30,31; Eph 2:15; Col 2:14-23; Heb 8:4-13; 9:8-24; 10:1-18. **NOTE:** This "TEMPORARY" label in Nave's is a classification that must be investigated against law-08's finding that none of the abolition passages explicitly names the Decalogue as abolished. Many of these references deal with ceremonial/sacrificial aspects (Heb 9:8-24; 10:1-18; Col 2:14-23).

### TESTAMENT
Brief entry: "A will" (Heb 9:16-18); "The new" (Mat 26:28; Mark 14:24; Luke 22:20; 1 Cor 11:25). Cross-references to COVENANT.

### OBEDIENCE
Extensive entry connecting obedience across both testaments. Key references include: Exo 19:5; 20:6; Deut 5:10; John 14:15,23,31; 15:10,14; Acts 5:29; Rom 6:17; 1 John 2:3-6; 3:22,24; 5:2,3; Rev 12:17; 22:7,14. The entry makes no distinction between old covenant obedience and new covenant obedience in terms of WHAT is obeyed -- only how obedience is enjoined and exemplified.

### HEART
The RENEWED subsection is directly relevant: Deut 30:6; Psa 51:10; Eze 11:19; 18:31; 36:26; Rom 2:29; Eph 4:23; Col 3:10. The entry notes the heart "should render to God obedience" (Deut 10:12; 11:13; 26:16; Eph 6:6). The UNREGENERATE heart is described as "hard" (Eze 2:4; 3:7; 11:19; 36:26; Rom 2:5). This directly connects to the stone-heart/flesh-heart motif in the new covenant promises.

### HOLY SPIRIT
The general scriptures section includes Eze 36:27; 37:9,14 (Spirit-empowered obedience), John 14:16,17,26; 15:26; 16:7-14 (the Comforter), Rom 8:1-27 (walk after the Spirit), 2 Cor 3:3,6,8,17,18 (Spirit writes on hearts; ministry of the Spirit), Gal 5:5,17,18,22,23,25 (fruit of the Spirit vs. works of the flesh).

### FAITH
Key references connecting faith and law: Rom 1:5 ("obedience to the faith"); 3:22-28,31; 4:1-25; Gal 3:1-29; Heb 11:1-39. Also Rev 14:12 ("the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus"). Faith is not presented as replacing obedience but as the basis for it.

### GRACE OF GOD
References include Rom 3:22-24; 4:4,5,16; 5:2,6-8,15-21; Eph 2:8,9; Tit 3:7. Grace is presented as the means of salvation, not as a replacement for law-keeping.

### SIN
Key reference: **1 John 3:4** -- "sin is the transgression of the law." This defines sin in terms of the law, implying the law must continue for sin to be definable. Also Rom 5:12-21; 7:7,13 (law reveals sin); James 2:10,11 (the whole law, citing specific Decalogue commandments).

### REDEMPTION
OF OUR SOULS: Rom 3:24-26; Tit 2:14 ("redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works"); Heb 9:12,15; 1 Pet 1:18,19. Redemption from sin, not from the law's moral standard.

### SALVATION
CONDITIONS OF include faith, obedience, and repentance (Mat 3:2; 18:3; John 3:3-12; Acts 2:38). PLAN OF includes Rom 1:16,17; Eph 2:4-10. Salvation is not presented as freedom from moral obligation but as freedom from sin's penalty and power.

### MORAL LAW (redirects to LAW)
Nave's does not have a separate "MORAL LAW" entry -- it redirects to the general LAW topic. This is consistent with law-06's finding that Hebrew vocabulary describes formal character rather than moral categories.

### TEN COMMANDMENTS (redirects to COMMANDMENTS)
No separate entry -- redirects to COMMANDMENTS, which treats the Decalogue as part of the broader commandments framework extending into the NT.

### SPIRIT (redirects to HOLY SPIRIT)
The SPIRIT topic redirects to HOLY SPIRIT and other subtopics.

### GRACES (redirects to GRACE OF GOD)
Redirects to the GRACE OF GOD entry.

### PROMISE
Not a separate major entry in Nave's. Key promise references are found under COVENANT (Gen 17:7; Jer 32:40; Heb 8:6 -- "better promises") and FAITH (Gal 3:14,16-18,29; Heb 6:12-17).
