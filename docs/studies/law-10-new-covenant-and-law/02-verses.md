### Jeremiah 31:31-34 -- The New Covenant Promise
> **31:31** Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
> **31:32** Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day [that] I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:
> **31:33** But this [shall be] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put **my law** in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
> **31:34** And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.

**Possessive pronouns:** "my covenant" (v.32), "**my law**" (v.33)
**Context (31:27-37):** The surrounding passage includes promises of restoration, individual responsibility (v.29-30), and the permanence of Israel compared to cosmic ordinances (v.35-37).

### Hebrews 8:6-13 -- The Better Covenant
> **8:6** But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
> **8:7** For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
> **8:8** For finding fault with **them**, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
> **8:9** Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in **my** covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
> **8:10** For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put **my laws** into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
> **8:11** And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
> **8:12** For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
> **8:13** In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old [is] ready to vanish away.

**Possessive pronouns:** "my covenant" (v.9), "**my laws**" (v.10)
**Greek note:** v.8 -- memphomenos autous = "finding fault with THEM" (accusative plural masculine) -- the fault is with the people, not the law

### Hebrews 10:15-18 -- The Holy Spirit's Witness
> **10:15** [Whereof] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
> **10:16** This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put **my laws** into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
> **10:17** And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
> **10:18** Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for sin.

**Possessive pronouns:** "**my laws**" (v.16)
**Context (10:1-18):** The preceding context is about the inadequacy of animal sacrifices (v.1-4) and Christ's once-for-all sacrifice (v.10-14). v.18 transitions from the new covenant promise to the conclusion: no more sin offering needed.

### Ezekiel 36:26-27 -- New Heart and Spirit
> **36:26** A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.
> **36:27** And I will put **my spirit** within you, and cause you to walk in **my statutes**, and ye shall keep **my judgments**, and do [them].

**Possessive pronouns:** "**my spirit**" (v.27), "**my statutes**" (v.27), "**my judgments**" (v.27)
**Context (36:22-32):** God acts for His holy name's sake (v.22), not for Israel's merit. He sprinkles clean water (v.25), gives a new heart/spirit (v.26-27), and they dwell in the land (v.28). They will loathe themselves for past sins (v.31).

### Romans 3:31 -- Faith Establishes Law
> **3:31** Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.

**Context (3:19-31):** By the law is the knowledge of sin (v.20); righteousness of God is manifested by faith (v.21-22); justified freely by grace (v.24); the law is NOT made void but ESTABLISHED through faith.

### Romans 8:1-4 -- Law Fulfilled in Spirit-Walkers
> **8:1** [There is] therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
> **8:2** For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
> **8:3** For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
> **8:4** That **the righteousness of the law** might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

**Greek note:** v.4 -- to dikaioma tou nomou = "the righteous requirement OF THE LAW" -- singular dikaioma with article = the specific righteous standard

### 1 John 5:2-3 -- Love Defined as Commandment-Keeping
> **5:2** By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep **his commandments**.
> **5:3** For this is the love of God, that we keep **his commandments**: and **his commandments** are not grievous.

**Possessive pronouns:** "**his commandments**" (v.2, v.3 twice)

> **3:6** Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.

**Context (3:7-18):** The ministration written and engraven in stones was glorious (v.7) but the ministration of the spirit exceeds in glory (v.8-9). The contrast is between the glory of the old administration and the surpassing glory of the new -- not between having law vs. having no law.
