# Bible Study: Does the New Covenant Abolish or Establish the Moral Law?

## Question
Does the new covenant abolish or establish the moral law? Specifically, do the new covenant promises in Jeremiah 31:33, Hebrews 8:10, Hebrews 10:16, and Ezekiel 36:26-27 indicate that the moral law (Ten Commandments) is written on believers' hearts and thus continues, or do they replace the old law with something entirely new? How do Romans 3:31, Romans 8:4, and 1 John 5:3 relate to this question?

## Methodology
This study is part of the **Law of God** series. The research and analysis agents MUST read and follow the series methodology:
- **Methodology file:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-series-methodology.md`
- **Master evidence file:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-master-evidence.md`

The methodology defines the Continues vs. Abolished positional framework, evidence classification tiers (E/N/I-A/I-B/I-C/I-D), classification decision trees, the SIS protocol, and the positional tally format. Every finding must be classified according to this methodology.

## Prior Studies in the Law Series
The research and analysis agents MUST read the conclusions from all prior studies, as they establish cumulative findings that this study builds upon:

### Key Cumulative Findings from Prior Studies

**From law-01 (God's Moral Law):** The Decalogue has 7 unique markers distinguishing it from all other legislation: direct divine voice, written by God's finger, on stone, placed inside the Ark, called "the testimony," preceded by "God spoke all these words," and described as complete ("he added no more"). 46 E-items support Continues, 0 Abolished.

**From law-02 (Law Before Sinai):** Moral law principles operated before Sinai in 6 categories: Sabbath at creation, Cain's murder, clean/unclean animals, Abraham's obedience, Joseph's moral awareness, manna-Sabbath test.

**From law-03 (Exodus 20 vs Later Laws):** Five dimensions of distinction between Decalogue and later laws: delivery mode, authorship, repository, naming conventions, boundary marker (Deut 5:22).

**From law-04 (Ceremonial Laws):** Shadow/type vocabulary is exclusively ceremonial. 1 Cor 7:19 distinguishes ceremonial from moral in a single verse. Five categories of ceremonial law identified.

**From law-05 (Civil/Judicial Laws):** Mishpatim serve as case-law applications of Decalogue principles. NT transfers judicial function to government and church.

**From law-06 (Hebrew Law Vocabulary):** Torah, mitsvah, choq, mishpat, edut, piqqud, chuqqah describe formal character, not moral categories. Eduth is exclusively associated with Decalogue tablets in narrative contexts.

**From law-07 (Law of Moses):** "Law of Moses" = comprehensive Pentateuchal legislation. "Law of Moses," "law of God," "law of the LORD" can be interchangeable for the same document. Paul uses contextual distinction: "law of God" = Decalogue in some contexts, "law of Moses" = broader code.

**From law-08 (Abolished at the Cross):** 7 abolition passages analyzed; none explicitly names the Decalogue as abolished. Greek dogma (G1378) is never used for the Decalogue. Cheirographon = hand-written document (not stone). 2 Cor 3:7 katargoumenen is FEMININE, agreeing with glory, not law.

**From law-09 (Old Covenant / New Covenant):** Old covenant = Sinai bilateral agreement; new covenant = same law placed on hearts. "Not according to" (Jer 31:32) applies to the BERITH (arrangement), not TORAH (content). Heb 8:8 fault is with THEM (autous), not the law. Five differences between covenants: location of law, power source, mediator, basis, scope.

**Key finding from law-09:** The new covenant does NOT change WHAT law is in force; it changes WHERE the law is placed (on hearts, not just on stone), HOW obedience is achieved (by the Spirit, not human effort), WHO mediates (Jesus, not Moses), WHAT basis (better promises, not works), and WHO is included (all nations, not just Israel). The "not according to" clause in Jer 31:32 applies to the berith (arrangement), not the torah (content).

### Focus Areas
The following focus areas are derived from the tool discoveries above and build on the cumulative findings of studies 1-9:

1. **Law Written on Hearts (Jer 31:33 / Heb 8:10 / Heb 10:16):** What specific law is written on hearts in the new covenant? The Hebrew and Greek vocabulary (H2710 chaqaq "engrave," [G1449](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1449/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} engrapho "inscribe") connects to physical writing on stone. Does the text identify WHICH law is written? Does the parallel between stone tablets and heart-writing imply the same Decalogue content?

2. **Spirit-Empowered Obedience (Eze 36:26-27 / Rom 8:4):** Ezekiel 36:26-27 promises a new heart and God's Spirit to cause walking in "my statutes" and keeping "my judgments." What do these terms (choqqim/mishpatim) refer to? Romans 8:4 says the dikaioma (G1345 -- righteous requirement) of the law is "fulfilled in us who walk... after the Spirit." Is this the moral law's requirement being fulfilled, or something else entirely?

3. **Faith Establishes Law (Rom 3:31):** Paul asks, "Do we then make void the law through faith?" and answers "God forbid: yea, we establish the law." What law is Paul referring to? The Greek histemi/histano means to "make stand" or "uphold." Does faith-based new covenant theology abolish or uphold the moral law?

4. **Love and Commandments (1 John 5:3 / John 14:15 / Rev 12:17 / Rev 14:12):** 1 John 5:3 defines love for God as keeping His commandments (entolai, G1785). John 14:15 connects love with keeping commandments. Revelation 12:17 and 14:12 describe end-time saints as those who "keep the commandments of God." Are these the Decalogue commandments or a new set of commandments?

5. **Nave's LAW "TEMPORARY" Section:** Nave's Topical Dictionary has a section under LAW labeled "TEMPORARY" that lists Jer 31:31-34, Gal 3:19-25, Heb 7:11-12,18, Heb 8:6-13, and Heb 10:1-9. The research agent must investigate: does this "temporary" classification apply to the moral law specifically, or to the ceremonial/sacrificial system? Cross-reference these with law-08's finding that none of the 7 abolition passages explicitly names the Decalogue.

6. **Covenant Continuity vs. Discontinuity:** The COVENANT topic in Nave's includes references to "perpetual" and "everlasting" covenants (Gen 17:7,13,19; Jer 32:40; Eze 37:26; Heb 13:20). How does the concept of an everlasting covenant relate to the moral law's permanence? Is the new covenant a replacement or a renewal/internalization?

7. **Obedience in the New Covenant:** Multiple Strong's numbers cluster around obedience (G5218 hupakoe, [G3980](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3980/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} peitharcheo, [H8085](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8085/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} shama). Paul speaks of "obedience of faith" (Rom 1:5, 16:26). Is new covenant obedience qualitatively different from old covenant obedience, or is it the same obedience with a different power source?

8. **Grace and Law Relationship (Rom 6:14-15 / Tit 2:11-12):** The GRACE and SALVATION topics intersect with LAW. Rom 6:14 says "ye are not under the law, but under grace." Does this mean the law is abolished, or that believers are no longer under condemnation by the law? Titus 2:11-12 says grace teaches us to live "soberly, righteously, and godly" -- does this echo moral law standards?
