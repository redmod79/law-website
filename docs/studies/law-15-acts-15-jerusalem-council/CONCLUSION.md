# What Did the Jerusalem Council Decide About the Law?

## Question
What did the Jerusalem Council decide about the law? Investigate the specific question posed (Acts 15:5 — "it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses"), Peter's speech about the "yoke" (v.10), James's ruling and the four prohibitions (v.20,29 — abstain from pollutions of idols, fornication, things strangled, blood), and the critical statement "For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day" (v.21). What was the council deciding — whether Gentiles must keep the entire Mosaic ceremonial system, or whether moral law obligations apply? Does v.21 assume ongoing Sabbath synagogue attendance? What is the relationship between the four prohibitions and the moral law? Also address the broader objection that "we are Gentiles, so the law was only for Jews and does not apply to us."

## Summary Answer
The Jerusalem Council addressed the specific question of whether Gentile believers must be circumcised and keep the law of Moses as a condition of salvation (Acts 15:1, 5). The council answered NO — Gentiles need not undergo proselyte conversion. Peter called this demand "a yoke which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear" (v.10), referring to the ceremonial system as a salvation mechanism. The council specified four "necessary things" (v.28): abstain from idols, fornication, things strangled, and blood. Two of these are Decalogue commandments (idolatry, fornication), and two have pre-Sinai universal scope (blood, strangled — Gen 9:4). James explained that only four items were specified because "Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day" (v.21) — Gentile converts would learn their full moral obligations through ongoing Sabbath instruction. The "we're Gentiles" objection is addressed by multiple NT passages that describe converted believers as no longer "Gentiles" in the covenantal sense: they are "fellow-citizens" (Eph 2:19), "Abraham's seed" (Gal 3:29), grafted into Israel's olive tree (Rom 11:17-24), and "the people of God" (1 Pet 2:10). The new covenant is made with "the house of Israel" (Heb 8:10; Jer 31:31), and believers are incorporated into Israel through faith.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | The Pharisees' demand was twofold: "to circumcise them, and (te) to command them to keep the law of Moses." Greek has two infinitives (peritemnein + parangellein terein) joined by te, forming a compound demand. Circumcision is singled out alongside "the law of Moses." | Acts 15:5 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Grammatical observation about the structure of the demand. Both sides accept this is what was demanded.) | E366 |
| E2 | The council's letter states: "Certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment." The apostles explicitly disavow the Judaizers' teaching. | Acts 15:24 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (The apostles disclaim the circumcision+law demand. Both sides accept this happened.) | E367 |
| E3 | The council calls the four prohibitions "these necessary things" (touton ton epanankes). The Greek epanankes means "of necessity" — qualifying the four items as obligatory, not optional. | Acts 15:28 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: the four items are called necessary. Both sides accept this.) | E368 |
| E4 | James states: "Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day" (kata pan sabbaton). The present tenses echei (has) and anaginoskomenos (being read) describe an ongoing reality. The gar (for) connects this to vv.19-20 as an explanation for the ruling. | Acts 15:21 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Textual observation about what James said and its grammatical structure. Both sides accept the verse says this.) | E369 |
| E5 | The council decrees are called dogmata (G1378) in Acts 16:4: "they delivered them the decrees (dogmata) for to keep." This is the same word used in Col 2:14 and Eph 2:15 for what was abolished. | Acts 16:4 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Lexical observation: same word dogma in Acts 16:4 as in Col 2:14/Eph 2:15. Both sides accept.) | E370 |
| E6 | In Acts 21:20, James tells Paul that "many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law." Believing Jews continued to observe the law after the council decision. | Acts 21:20 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: Jewish believers continued in the law. Both sides accept this historical report.) | E371 |
| E7 | In Acts 21:25, the distinction is restated: "As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication." | Acts 21:25 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual restatement of the council decision. Both sides accept this.) | E372 |
| E8 | Paul writes to believers: "Remember, that ye being in time past (pote) Gentiles in the flesh." The temporal particle pote marks Gentile identity as a past state. | Eph 2:11 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Grammatical observation: Paul uses past tense for Gentile identity. Both sides accept this textual fact.) | E373 |
| E9 | Paul states the past deprivation and present transformation: "At that time ye were (ete, imperfect) without Christ, being alienated (apellotriomenoi, perfect passive) from the commonwealth (politeias) of Israel...But now (nyni de) in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh." | Eph 2:12-13 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Textual observation about temporal contrast. Both sides accept Paul says this.) | E374 |
| E10 | Paul states: "Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens (sympolitai, G4847) with the saints, and of the household of God." The hapax legomenon sympolitai describes full civic incorporation. | Eph 2:19 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Textual observation about Paul's statement. Both sides accept he says this.) | E375 |
| E11 | Paul states: "Ye know that ye WERE (ete, imperfect) Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led." The imperfect tense and temporal adverb hote mark Gentile identity as past. | 1Co 12:2 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Grammatical observation: past tense for Gentile identity.) | E376 |
| E12 | Paul states: "There is neither Jew nor Greek...for ye are all one (heis) in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." The first-class conditional (ei + indicative) assumes the condition is true. | Gal 3:28-29 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Textual observation: Paul states Jew/Greek distinction erased; those in Christ are Abraham's seed.) | E377 |
| E13 | Paul describes Gentile believers as wild olive branches "graffed in among" the natural branches of Israel's olive tree, partaking "of the root and fatness of the olive tree." He warns: "thou bearest not the root, but the root thee." | Rom 11:17-18 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Textual observation: Paul describes grafting. Both sides accept the metaphor exists.) | E378 |
| E14 | Peter applies Israel's covenantal language to the church: "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people...which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God." Echoes Exo 19:5-6 and Hos 2:23. | 1Pe 2:9-10 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Textual observation: Peter applies Israel's identity language to the church. Both sides accept this.) | E379 |
| E15 | The new covenant is explicitly made with "the house of Israel and with the house of Judah" (Jer 31:31; Heb 8:8). The text does not state a separate covenant for Gentiles. | Jer 31:31; Heb 8:8 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Textual observation: the new covenant's stated parties are Israel and Judah.) | E380 |
| E16 | Paul states: "They are not all Israel, which are of Israel." Israel is defined by more than ethnic descent. | Rom 9:6 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Textual observation both sides accept.) | E381 |
| E17 | Paul states: "He is not a Jew, which is one outwardly...But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart." Jewishness is redefined as an inward/spiritual reality. | Rom 2:28-29 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Textual observation both sides accept.) | E382 |
| E18 | Jesus states: "Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd." | Jhn 10:16 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Textual observation both sides accept.) | E383 |
| E19 | Isaiah prophesies: "Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him...every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; even them will I bring to my holy mountain." Foreigners who join the LORD are expected to keep the Sabbath. | Isa 56:6-7 | Continues | V1: Yes — "keepeth the sabbath" is law-continuation vocabulary applied to foreigners joining the LORD; "taketh hold of my covenant" pairs Sabbath-keeping with covenant membership for non-Israelites. -> Candidate CONTINUES. Gate 1: PASS — the subject is explicitly identified as "sons of the stranger" (foreigners), and the commandment is explicitly named (the sabbath). Gate 2: PASS — participial construction (shomer, "keeping") is unambiguous. Gate 3: PASS — prophetic direct speech ("Thus saith the LORD"). Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E014 (commandments stand forever), E021 (not one jot passes), E320 (Jesus's Sabbath custom). -> CONTINUES. | E384 |
| E20 | The blood prohibition was given to Noah before Sinai: "But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat." This is a universal commandment to all humanity through Noah. | Gen 9:4 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Textual observation: blood prohibition is pre-Sinai and universal. Both sides accept this.) | E385 |
| E21 | The blood prohibition in Leviticus explicitly applies to "the strangers that sojourn among you" (Lev 17:10, 12). The sexual immorality laws likewise apply to "any stranger that sojourneth among you" (Lev 18:26). Both categories extend beyond ethnic Israel. | Lev 17:10, 12; Lev 18:26 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Textual observation: these laws applied to non-Israelites. Both sides accept this.) | E386 |
| E22 | Revelation 2:14, 20 addresses the same combination of idolatry and fornication in the messages to the churches: "to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication." These are condemned in the post-apostolic church context, confirming ongoing moral relevance. | Rev 2:14, 20 | Continues | V1: Yes — condemnation of idolatry and fornication in the churches uses moral-law vocabulary (idols = 1st/2nd commandment; fornication = 7th commandment). -> Candidate CONTINUES. Gate 1: PASS — the referents (idolatry, fornication) are specific and identifiable. Gate 2: PASS — imperative condemnation. Gate 3: PASS — didactic (letters to churches, though in Revelation, they are direct-speech from Christ). Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E028 (Decalogue content in Rom 13:8-10), E031-E032 (commandments of God in Revelation). -> CONTINUES. | E387 |
| E23 | Paul states salvation is by grace for both Jews and Gentiles: "We believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they." | Acts 15:11 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual statement about the basis of salvation. Both sides accept.) | E388 |

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Tree 4 Trace | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The Jerusalem Council's question was specifically about circumcision and keeping the law of Moses as a soteriological requirement (Acts 15:1: "ye cannot be saved"; Acts 15:5: "it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses"). The council was not debating whether the moral law applies to believers; it was debating whether the ceremonial proselyte conversion process is required for salvation. | E366, E367, E145, E146 | Neutral | Gate 0: N-Test 1 = YES (both sides agree the presenting issue was circumcision for salvation). N-Test 2 = YES (no choice between readings — Acts 15:1 says "ye cannot be saved"). N-Test 3 = YES (no added concepts). -> PASS. V1/V2: Neither -> Neutral. (Both sides agree the question was about ceremonial requirements for salvation.) | N076 |
| N2 | The council retained fornication (porneia, a moral prohibition — 7th commandment) as a "necessary thing" while releasing Gentiles from circumcision and the ceremonial system. The council therefore did not release Gentiles from moral law obligations; it released them from ceremonial requirements. | E146, E368, E366 | Continues | Gate 0: N-Test 1 = YES (both sides acknowledge fornication is in the list and is a moral prohibition; both acknowledge circumcision was released). N-Test 2 = YES (no alternative reading — fornication is retained, circumcision is released). N-Test 3 = YES (no concepts added; the observation is about what is in and what is out of the list). -> PASS. V1: Yes — the council retaining a moral prohibition while releasing ceremonial requirements supports the distinction between moral and ceremonial law. This distinction is a core tenet of the Continues position. -> CONTINUES. Gate 1: PASS — fornication (moral) and circumcision (ceremonial) are identifiable referents. Gate 2: PASS. Gate 3: PASS. Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E143 (1 Cor 7:19: circumcision nothing, commandments everything). -> CONTINUES. | N077 |
| N3 | James's explanatory clause (Acts 15:21, introduced by gar = "for") connects the four-item ruling to the ongoing Sabbath reading of Moses in the synagogues. The only way v.21 explains v.19-20 is if the Gentile converts will be present in the synagogues on the Sabbath to hear Moses read — otherwise the verse has no explanatory force for limiting the written requirements to four items. | E369, E368 | Neutral | Gate 0: N-Test 1 = A scholar from the Abolished position might argue v.21 merely explains why Moses doesn't need to be formally imposed (Moses is already widely available). The explanatory function of gar could be read differently. -> FAIL. This is not universally agreed. -> Reclassify as I (inference). | Moved to I-item |
| N4 | Multiple NT authors using different metaphors describe the same reality: converted Gentile believers are incorporated into Israel's covenantal community. Paul uses citizenship (Eph 2:19, sympolitai), grafting (Rom 11:17-18, agrielaios grafted into kallielaios), and Abrahamic descent (Gal 3:29, Abraham's seed). Peter uses covenant identity (1 Pet 2:9-10, chosen generation/royal priesthood/holy nation). John records Jesus's one-fold imagery (Jhn 10:16). All of these describe non-Israelites becoming part of Israel's covenant people. | E375, E378, E377, E379, E383 | Neutral | Gate 0: N-Test 1 = YES (both sides acknowledge these passages exist and describe Gentile incorporation into God's people). N-Test 2 = YES (the passages use citizenship, grafting, seed, and identity language — no alternative reading that denies incorporation). N-Test 3 = YES (no concepts added; the observation is that multiple authors describe incorporation). -> PASS. V1/V2: Neither directly addresses moral law continuation or cessation. -> Neutral. (This is a factual observation about Gentile identity. Both sides accept it as textual reality, though they disagree about its implications for law-keeping.) | N078 |
| N5 | The NT uses past-tense grammar for Gentile identity of believers: pote ("formerly," Eph 2:11), ete ("you were," 1 Cor 12:2, Eph 2:12), "in time past" (1 Pet 2:10). Present-tense grammar describes the new identity: "ye ARE fellow-citizens" (Eph 2:19), "ye ARE Abraham's seed" (Gal 3:29), "ARE NOW the people of God" (1 Pet 2:10). The grammatical pattern is consistent across three authors (Paul, Peter, via John's record of Jesus). | E373, E374, E375, E376, E377, E379 | Neutral | Gate 0: N-Test 1 = YES (the grammatical tenses are verifiable facts). N-Test 2 = YES (no interpretation required — past tense is past tense). N-Test 3 = YES (no concepts added). -> PASS. V1/V2: Neither -> Neutral. (Grammatical observation both sides accept.) | N079 |
| N6 | The new covenant is made with "the house of Israel and with the house of Judah" (Jer 31:31; Heb 8:8). There is only one new covenant in Scripture. If Gentile believers participate in this covenant (which both sides agree they do), they must be part of "the house of Israel" in some sense — since the covenant's stated parties are Israel and Judah, and there is no separate Gentile covenant. | E380, E039, E375, E377, E378 | Neutral | Gate 0: N-Test 1 = A scholar from either position might dispute the conclusion that Gentiles "must be part of Israel." The Abolished position could argue that the new covenant is universalized beyond its original stated parties without requiring Gentile identification with Israel. -> This requires choosing between readings. -> FAIL. Reclassify as I. | Moved to I-item |

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria | Position | Master ID |
|---|---|------|---|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that the Jerusalem Council released Gentiles from the entire law, including the moral law (Decalogue), since Peter called it "a yoke" and the council did not impose commandment-keeping beyond four items. | I-B | FOR: Peter calls the demand a "yoke...which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear" (E145/Acts 15:10). The council's letter says "no greater burden than these necessary things" (E368/Acts 15:28). AGAINST: The "yoke" is identified by context as the compound demand of v.5 (circumcision + law of Moses as soteriological requirement — E366). The council retains fornication, a moral prohibition (N077/E146). James assumes ongoing Sabbath synagogue instruction (E369/Acts 15:21). Paul afterward affirms "the keeping of the commandments of God" (E143/1 Cor 7:19). Paul says "we establish the law" (E025/Rom 3:31). | The claim that the moral law is included in the "yoke" requires adding a concept: that the moral law itself is an unbearable burden. The text identifies the yoke as the ceremonial proselyte requirement (v.5). The moral law is called "the law of liberty" (Jas 1:25), "not grievous" (1 Jn 5:3), "holy, just, good" (Rom 7:12) — vocabulary incompatible with an unbearable yoke. Choosing to include the moral law in "yoke" requires overriding these characterizations. | #1, #2 | Abolished | I095 |
| I2 | The Bible teaches that Acts 15:21 assumes ongoing Sabbath synagogue attendance by Gentile converts, and that the four prohibitions are only the starting minimum — the full scope of moral instruction would be learned through weekly Sabbath reading of Moses. | I-A | James says "Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day" (E369/Acts 15:21). The gar (for) connects this to the four-item ruling as explanation. The council specifies only four items while James notes Moses is read every Sabbath — the simplest reading is that the four items suffice for the written ruling because Moses provides the comprehensive instruction. Luke records Gentiles attending Sabbath synagogue services (Acts 13:42-44). Luke uses identical vocabulary for Jesus's and Paul's Sabbath custom (Luk 4:16; Acts 17:2 — kata to eiothos). | This requires systematizing the explanatory function of gar with the content of v.19-20 to conclude that v.21 implies ongoing Sabbath attendance AND that the four items are minimal. The text does not explicitly state "Gentile converts will attend synagogue on the Sabbath to learn the rest." This is the most natural inference from the explanatory clause, but it requires connecting the dots. | #5 (systematizing) | Continues | I096 |
| I3 | The Bible teaches that the "we're Gentiles, so the law doesn't apply to us" objection fails, because: (a) converted believers are no longer "Gentiles" in the covenantal sense (past-tense grammar in Eph 2:11, 1 Cor 12:2, 1 Pet 2:10), (b) they are grafted into Israel (Rom 11:17-24), (c) they are Abraham's seed (Gal 3:29), (d) they are fellow-citizens of Israel's commonwealth (Eph 2:19), and (e) the new covenant is made with "the house of Israel" (Heb 8:8; Jer 31:31), which includes grafted-in Gentiles. | I-A | Paul says "ye being in time past (pote) Gentiles" (E373/Eph 2:11). Paul says "ye WERE Gentiles" (E376/1 Cor 12:2). Paul says "ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens" (E375/Eph 2:19). Paul says "ye are Abraham's seed" (E377/Gal 3:29). Paul describes grafting into Israel's tree (E378/Rom 11:17-18). Peter says "are now the people of God" (E379/1 Pet 2:10). The new covenant is with Israel (E380/Heb 8:8; Jer 31:31). | Each individual E-item is a textual fact. The systematization is connecting all of these to form the conclusion that the "Gentile" identity objection fails because the identity itself changes at conversion. No concept is added beyond what the texts state — only the synthesis of multiple texts into a unified argument. | #5 (systematizing) | Continues | I097 |
| I4 | The Bible teaches that the four prohibitions of Acts 15 represent the moral law categories most urgently relevant to converts from paganism, not the totality of Christian moral obligation. This is evidenced by two being Decalogue commandments (idolatry = 1st/2nd; fornication = 7th), two being pre-Sinai universal commands (blood/strangled = Gen 9:4), and the NT epistles subsequently teaching extensive Decalogue content to Gentile churches (Rom 13:8-10; Eph 4-6; Col 3). | I-A | The four items include idolatry and fornication (E146/Acts 15:29), which correspond to Decalogue commandments (Exo 20:3-5, 14). Blood prohibition predates Sinai (E385/Gen 9:4). Paul later teaches Decalogue content to Gentile churches (E028/Rom 13:8-10). Rev 2:14, 20 condemns idolatry + fornication in churches (E387). The council calls these "necessary things" (E368), not "the only things." James explains that Moses provides further instruction (E369/Acts 15:21). | This systematizes the four items into "urgent categories for pagan converts" and connects to later NT instruction. The text does not explicitly say "these four are just the beginning." The inference requires combining the list's content, the "necessary" qualifier, James's explanation about Moses, and later epistolary evidence. | #5 (systematizing) | Continues | I098 |
| I5 | The Bible teaches that the Jerusalem Council abolished the moral law for Gentile believers, since only four items were specified and none of the other Decalogue commandments (murder, theft, false witness, covetousness, Sabbath) are listed. If these moral commands still applied, the council would have listed them. | I-D | The council lists four items (E146/Acts 15:29). The Decalogue has ten commandments. Only fornication and idolatry (arguably) overlap with the four. Murder, theft, false witness, covetousness, Sabbath are not explicitly listed. | This requires overriding: (1) James's explanation that Moses is read every Sabbath for further instruction (E369/Acts 15:21); (2) Paul's subsequent Decalogue instruction to Gentile churches (E028/Rom 13:8-10); (3) Paul's statement "circumcision is nothing...but the keeping of the commandments of God" (E143/1 Cor 7:19); (4) the council's own language of "no greater burden than these NECESSARY things" (not "these ONLY things" — E368). The argument from silence (non-listing = abolition) requires the unstated premise that the four items constitute an exhaustive moral code, which the text does not claim. | #1 (adds concept: silence = abolition), overrides E369, E143, E028 | Abolished | I099 |
| I6 | The Bible teaches that since the "we're Gentiles" objection fails (the NT redefines believer identity), and since the new covenant writes God's pre-existing moral law on hearts (Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10), Gentile believers grafted into Israel are under the same moral law as Israel, including the Sabbath commandment. Isaiah 56:6-7 explicitly connects Sabbath-keeping with foreigners joined to the LORD. | I-A | Believers are grafted into Israel (E378/Rom 11:17-18). They are Abraham's seed (E377/Gal 3:29). They are fellow-citizens (E375/Eph 2:19). The new covenant writes God's law on hearts (E039/Heb 8:10). Isaiah 56:6-7 says foreigners who join the LORD keep the Sabbath and take hold of the covenant (E384). | This systematizes the identity passages with the new covenant law-on-hearts promise and Isaiah 56 to conclude that the moral law (including Sabbath) applies to all believers. The individual components are textually grounded. The inference is in the systematization: connecting identity change + new covenant law + Isaiah 56 into a unified argument. | #5 (systematizing) | Continues | I100 |
| I7 | The Bible teaches that the "yoke" in Acts 15:10 refers to the moral law itself, proving the moral law was recognized as burdensome even by the apostles and that the gospel frees believers from it. | I-D | Peter says "a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear" (E145/Acts 15:10). Galatians 5:1 refers to "the yoke of bondage." | This requires overriding: (1) The contextual identification of the yoke as the demand of v.5 — circumcision + law of Moses as salvation requirement (E366); (2) The moral law is called "holy, just, good, spiritual" (E010/Rom 7:12, 14), "law of liberty" (Jas 1:25; 2:12), "perfect" (Psa 19:7 / E012), "not grievous" (1 Jn 5:3 / E030) — none of which is compatible with "unbearable yoke"; (3) Paul immediately after the council affirms "the keeping of the commandments of God" as what matters (E143/1 Cor 7:19). The claim requires the moral law to be simultaneously "holy, just, good" and an "unbearable yoke" — contradictory characterizations. | #1 (adds concept: yoke = moral law), overrides E010, E012, E030, E143 | Abolished | I101 |

### I-B Resolution: I1 — Did the Jerusalem Council release Gentiles from the moral law?

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR (Abolished reading): E145 (yoke on disciples), E368 (no greater burden than four things)
- AGAINST (Continues reading): E366 (the demand was circumcision + law of Moses), N077 (fornication retained = moral law retained), E369 (Moses read every Sabbath for further instruction), E143 (circumcision nothing, commandments everything), E025 (we establish the law), E028 (Decalogue content in Rom 13:8-10), E387 (Rev 2:14,20 — idolatry + fornication condemned in churches)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E145 (yoke) | Contextually Clear | The "yoke" is identified by the context (v.5) as the compound demand of circumcision + law of Moses as a soteriological requirement. To apply it to the moral law requires importing a meaning the context does not supply. |
| E368 (necessary things) | Contextually Clear | "No greater burden" addresses the ceremonial dispute, not moral obligation generally. "Necessary" (epanankes) means these items are required, not that nothing else is required. |
| E366 (the demand) | Plain | Acts 15:5 plainly states the demand: circumcise + keep law of Moses. This is what the council addressed. |
| N077 (fornication retained) | Plain | Fornication is in the list — a moral command retained. This is directly observable. |
| E369 (Moses read every Sabbath) | Contextually Clear | James's gar clause provides the reason for limiting the written requirements. |
| E143 (1 Cor 7:19) | Plain | Paul directly states circumcision is nothing, commandments of God are what matter. Same author, same period. |
| E025 (Rom 3:31) | Plain | "Do we make void the law? God forbid: we establish the law." Emphatic denial. |
| E028 (Rom 13:8-10) | Plain | Paul explicitly lists Decalogue commandments as the content love fulfills. |
| E387 (Rev 2:14,20) | Plain | Idolatry + fornication condemned in churches post-council. |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
The FOR side has 2 items (E145, E368), both Contextually Clear — they support the reading only if the moral law is included in "yoke" and "burden," which the context does not specify.
The AGAINST side has 7 items: 5 Plain (E366, N077, E143, E025, E028, E387) and 1 Contextually Clear (E369). The Plain items directly address the moral law's ongoing status.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
The plain statements (E143: "commandments of God" matter; E025: "we establish the law"; E028: Decalogue in Rom 13; N077: fornication retained) interpret the contextually clear statements (E145: yoke; E368: no greater burden). The "yoke" is the ceremonial system as a salvation mechanism, not the moral law. The "necessary things" are starting points for pagan converts, not the totality of moral obligation.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Strong (against the Abolished reading)**
Plain statements on the AGAINST side, with only Contextually Clear statements on the FOR side. The clear passages determine the reading of the less clear: the council addressed ceremonial requirements, not moral law.

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements:**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases actual verse text. Checked.
- Each is the plain meaning of the words. Checked.
- E-items state what the text says, not what a position infers. Checked.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items:**
- E19 (Isa 56:6-7) classified Continues: Tree 3 run — V1 pass (Sabbath-keeping by foreigners), Gate 1 PASS (subject identified: sons of the stranger; commandment: the sabbath), Gate 2 PASS, Gate 3 PASS, Gate 4 PASS. Classification stands.
- E22 (Rev 2:14,20) classified Continues: Tree 3 run — V1 pass (condemnation of idolatry + fornication = moral law enforcement), Gate 1 PASS (idolatry and fornication identified), Gate 2 PASS, Gate 3 PASS (direct-speech from Christ), Gate 4 PASS. Classification stands.
- All other new E-items classified Neutral: verified — neither continuation nor cessation vocabulary applied to the moral law. Correct.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications:**
- N1 (council's question was ceremonial): N-Test 1 = YES, N-Test 2 = YES, N-Test 3 = YES. Verified as N.
- N2 (fornication retained = moral law retained): N-Test 1 = YES, N-Test 2 = YES, N-Test 3 = YES. Verified as N.
- N3 (originally attempted): FAILED N-Test 1 — reclassified as I2. Correct.
- N4 (multiple authors describe incorporation): N-Test 1 = YES, N-Test 2 = YES, N-Test 3 = YES. Verified as N.
- N5 (past-tense grammar): N-Test 1 = YES, N-Test 2 = YES, N-Test 3 = YES. Verified as N.
- N6 (originally attempted): FAILED N-Test 1 — reclassified as I-item (part of I3/I6). Correct.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test):**
- I1: FOR and AGAINST all come from E/N tables. Text-derived. -> I-B. Correct.
- I2: All components from E/N tables (E369, E146, Acts 13:42-44). -> Text-derived. Direction: does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value — the reading is the natural function of gar. -> I-A. Correct.
- I3: All components from E/N tables (E373-E379, E380, E039). -> Text-derived. -> I-A. Correct.
- I4: All components from E/N tables (E146, E385, E028, E387, E368, E369). -> Text-derived. -> I-A. Correct.
- I5: External concept (silence = abolition). -> External. Overrides E369, E143, E028. -> I-D. Correct.
- I6: All components from E/N tables (E378, E377, E375, E039, E384). -> Text-derived. -> I-A. Correct.
- I7: External concept (yoke = moral law). -> Overrides E010, E012, E030, E143. -> I-D. Correct.

**Step D: Verify direction test:**
- I1: Requires E145 to mean "moral law is a yoke" (not its lexical value in context). -> Conflicts. I-B confirmed.
- I2: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. -> Aligns. I-A confirmed.
- I3: Aligns with all E/N. I-A confirmed.
- I4: Aligns with all E/N. I-A confirmed.
- I5: Requires E369 to have no explanatory force, E143 to be irrelevant. -> Conflicts. I-D confirmed.
- I6: Aligns. I-A confirmed.
- I7: Overrides E010, E012, E030. -> Conflicts. I-D confirmed.

**Step E: Consistency checks:**
- I-A items (I2, I3, I4, I6): Each requires only #5 (systematizing). Verified.
- I-B item (I1): Has E/N on both sides. Verified. Resolution completed above.
- I-D items (I5, I7): Each overrides at least one E/N statement. Verified.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections:**
- I-B Resolution for I1: Connection between E145 and the ceremonial context (v.5) is verified by the te-particle structure (E366). The connection between E143 and Acts 15 is same-author (Paul), same period. SIS documented.

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies)

- The Jerusalem Council addressed the specific demand that Gentile believers must be circumcised and keep the law of Moses for salvation (Acts 15:1, 5).
- The council, with the Holy Spirit, determined that Gentiles need not be circumcised or keep the ceremonial system (Acts 15:28-29).
- The council retained fornication (a moral prohibition) as a "necessary thing" while releasing the ceremonial requirement (Acts 15:29).
- Peter called the ceremonial proselyte demand "a yoke which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear" (Acts 15:10).
- James stated that Moses is read in the synagogues every Sabbath (Acts 15:21), connecting this to the four-item ruling with gar (for).
- Paul states "circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God" (1 Cor 7:19).
- Multiple NT authors describe converted Gentile believers in past-tense Gentile identity and present-tense Israel-incorporation language (Eph 2:11-19; 1 Cor 12:2; Gal 3:28-29; Rom 11:17-24; 1 Pet 2:9-10).
- The new covenant is made with "the house of Israel" (Jer 31:31; Heb 8:8).
- Isaiah 56:6-7 describes foreigners joined to the LORD keeping the Sabbath and holding the covenant.
- The blood prohibition predates Sinai and was given to all humanity through Noah (Gen 9:4).
- Jewish believers continued to be "zealous of the law" after the council decision (Acts 21:20).

## What CANNOT Be Said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture)

- It cannot be said that the council abolished the moral law for Gentile believers. The text retains fornication (moral) and the NT epistles subsequently teach Decalogue content to Gentile churches.
- It cannot be said that the four prohibitions constitute the totality of Gentile moral obligation. James's gar clause (v.21) points to further instruction, and Paul teaches extensive Decalogue content afterward.
- It cannot be said that the "yoke" (Acts 15:10) refers to the moral law. The context identifies it as the ceremonial proselyte requirement.
- It cannot be said that Acts 15 explicitly commands Sabbath-keeping for Gentiles. The text describes an existing practice (v.21) but does not issue a prescriptive command.
- It cannot be said that the "we're Gentiles" objection is supported by the NT. Multiple authors use past-tense grammar for Gentile identity and present-tense language for incorporation into Israel.
- It cannot be said that converted believers remain "Gentiles" in the covenantal sense. The NT consistently redefines their identity.
- It cannot be said that Acts 15:21 has no connection to Sabbath observance. Its explanatory function (gar) connects it to the ruling, and the present tenses describe an ongoing reality.
- It cannot be said that the council created a two-tier moral system (one standard for Jews, another for Gentiles). The council addressed ceremonial requirements; the moral law applies universally.

## Conclusion

The Jerusalem Council addressed a specific question: must Gentile believers be circumcised and keep the law of Moses for salvation? The council answered no. Peter identified the demand as an unbearable yoke — the ceremonial proselyte requirement as a means of earning salvation. James ruled that Gentile converts should abstain from four items (idols, fornication, strangled, blood) and explained that Moses would provide ongoing instruction through Sabbath synagogue reading.

The council's ruling is consistent with — not opposed to — the continuation of the moral law. Two of the four specified prohibitions are Decalogue commandments (idolatry, fornication). The council released Gentiles from the ceremonial system, not from moral obligation. Paul's post-council teaching confirms this: "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God" (1 Cor 7:19).

The "we're Gentiles" objection is addressed by multiple NT passages using past-tense grammar for Gentile identity (Eph 2:11; 1 Cor 12:2) and present-tense language for incorporation into Israel (Eph 2:19; Gal 3:29; Rom 11:17-24; 1 Pet 2:9-10). The new covenant is made with "the house of Israel" (Heb 8:10; Jer 31:31), and believers are grafted into Israel. Isaiah 56:6-7 anticipates foreigners joining the LORD and keeping the Sabbath.

In this study, 23 explicit statements were classified: 21 Neutral, 2 Continues, 0 Abolished. Four necessary implications: 1 Continues, 3 Neutral, 0 Abolished. Seven inferences: 4 I-A Continues, 1 I-B (resolved Strong against Abolished), 2 I-D Abolished. The Abolished claims require overriding multiple explicit statements and necessary implications. The Continues claims are text-derived and require only systematization of explicit evidence.
