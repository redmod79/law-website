# Bible Study: What Did the Jerusalem Council Decide About the Law?

## Question

What did the Jerusalem Council decide about the law? Investigate the specific question posed (Acts 15:5 -- "it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses"), Peter's speech about the "yoke" (v.10), James's ruling and the four prohibitions (v.20,29 -- abstain from pollutions of idols, fornication, things strangled, blood), and the critical statement "For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day" (v.21). What was the council deciding -- whether Gentiles must keep the entire Mosaic ceremonial system, or whether moral law obligations apply? Does v.21 assume ongoing Sabbath synagogue attendance? What is the relationship between the four prohibitions and the moral law? Also address the broader objection that "we are Gentiles, so the law was only for Jews and does not apply to us." Investigate whether believers remain "Gentiles" after conversion: Eph 2:11-13 (past tense), 1 Cor 12:2 ("Ye know that ye WERE Gentiles" -- past tense), Gal 3:28-29 ("neither Jew nor Greek... ye are Abraham's seed"), Rom 11:17-24 (Gentiles grafted into Israel's olive tree), 1 Pet 2:9 ("ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation"). If the new covenant is made with "the house of Israel" (Heb 8:10) and there is only ONE new covenant, and if believers are grafted into Israel, does the "we're Gentiles" objection hold?

## Methodology

Read and follow the methodology in `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-series-methodology.md`.

INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by those who say the law continues, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by those who say the law is abolished, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says. Do not use editorial characterizations like "genuine tension," "strongest argument," "most significant challenge," "honestly acknowledge," or "non-intuitive reading." Simply state what each passage says and what each side infers from it.
- When presenting findings, state: "The text says X" (explicit). Then state: "From this, Y interpretation infers Z" and "W interpretation infers V" (inferred).
- Never use language like "irrefutable," "obviously," or "clearly proves." Use "the text states," "this is consistent with."
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.

**Key findings from prior study conclusions:**

1. **law-01 (God's Moral Law):** Established the Decalogue's unique markers (God's voice, God's finger, stone, inside ark, "he added no more") and its attributes that mirror God's character. Universal scope demonstrated (Rom 2:14-15; Rev 14:12).

2. **law-03 (Exodus 20 vs. Later Laws):** Demonstrated five textual dimensions distinguishing the Decalogue from subsequent legislation: delivery mode, authorship, repository, naming conventions, boundary marker.

3. **law-04 (Ceremonial Laws):** Classified circumcision as a ceremonial law delivered through Moses. Acts 15:10 identified as Peter calling circumcision + law-of-Moses requirement a "yoke." 1 Cor 7:19 dismisses circumcision while affirming commandments of God. Shadow/type vocabulary (skia, typos) applied exclusively to the ceremonial system, never to the Decalogue.

4. **law-07 (Law of Moses):** The phrase "the law of Moses" refers to the comprehensive Pentateuchal legislation. When specific content is identified, it is ceremonial (7x), civil (3x), curses (2x), or literary (2x). Acts 15:5 classified: circumcision singled out alongside "the law of Moses."

5. **law-08 (Abolished at Cross):** None of the seven NT abolition passages names the Decalogue as abolished. The vocabulary dogma (G1378) is used in the two primary abolition texts and is never used for the Decalogue. Acts 15:28-29 releases Gentiles from circumcision and ceremonial law but retains moral prohibition (fornication).

6. **law-09 (Old Covenant/New Covenant):** The old covenant's weakness was the people, not the law. The new covenant writes the SAME law on hearts. Five differences between covenants: location, power, mediator, basis, forgiveness -- none is a change in the law's content.

7. **law-10 (New Covenant and Law):** New covenant passages consistently describe God's pre-existing moral law being written on hearts by the Spirit. Possessive pronouns ("MY law," "MY laws") identify the content as God's existing law.

8. **law-13 (Jesus and Sabbath):** Luke uses identical Greek (kata to eiothos) for both Jesus' Sabbath synagogue custom (Luk 4:16) and Paul's (Acts 17:2). Sabbath-keeping "remaineth" (sabbatismos, Heb 4:9).

9. **law-14 (Jesus' Law Teachings):** No passage records Jesus abolishing any moral commandment. He affirms, deepens, and defends the moral law throughout.

### Focus Areas

Derived from tool discoveries, the research agent should investigate:

1. **The specific question before the council (Acts 15:5):** What exactly did the Pharisees demand? Examine the Greek syntax of "to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses" -- are these two separate demands or one compound demand? Prior study (law-07) notes circumcision is singled out alongside "the law of Moses" with two infinitives joined by "te."

2. **Peter's "yoke" (Acts 15:10):** What is the yoke? Prior studies identified this as the ceremonial/Mosaic system requirement. Compare with Jesus' yoke (Mat 11:29-30) and Gal 5:1. Examine [G2218](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2218/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (zygos) usage. Does Peter mean the moral law is a yoke, or the ceremonial system as a soteriological requirement?

3. **James's ruling and the four prohibitions (Acts 15:20,29):** Why these four? Are they moral or ceremonial? What connects pollutions of idols, fornication, things strangled, and blood? Do these correspond to pre-Sinai/universal moral obligations (Gen 9:4 blood; idolatry and fornication as universal prohibitions)? Are they the "Noahide" minimum? Or are they accommodations for Jewish-Gentile fellowship? The tool found STRANGLED in Nave's with only Acts 15 references, suggesting this is a unique prohibition.

4. **Acts 15:21 -- "Moses read in synagogues every sabbath":** What is the function of this verse in James's argument? Does it assume ongoing Sabbath synagogue attendance by believing Gentiles? Does it mean "Moses is widely available, so they will learn the rest"? Or does it explain why only four items are specified (Moses covers the rest)? The SYNAGOGUE topic confirms Scripture reading on Sabbath was the regular practice (NEH 8:1-8; ACT 13:14-44; 17:2). The LAW topic confirms "In synagogues LUK 4:16,32; ACT 13:14-52; 15:21."

5. **The "we're Gentiles" objection:** Investigate whether converted believers retain their pre-conversion identity as "Gentiles." Collect all past-tense references to Gentile identity (Eph 2:11-13; 1 Cor 12:2; 1 Pet 2:9-10). Examine the grafting metaphor (Rom 11:17-24) -- [G65](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g65/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (agrielaios, wild olive) and [G2565](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2565/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (kallielaios, cultivated olive). Examine [G4847](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4847/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (sympolites, fellow-citizen) and [G4174](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4174/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (politeia, commonwealth) in Eph 2:12,19. Does the new covenant being made with "the house of Israel" (Heb 8:10; Jer 31:31) have implications for Gentile believers who are grafted into Israel?

6. **Relationship of four prohibitions to moral law:** Fornication (porneia) is clearly a moral prohibition. Idolatry violates the first two commandments. Blood and strangled -- are these moral (Gen 9:4 precedes Sinai) or ceremonial? Examine Lev 17:10-14 in context. Are these four the minimum moral floor or the full extent of Gentile obligation?

7. **Acts 16:4 -- dogmata:** The council's decisions are called "decrees" (dogmata, G1378). This is the same word used in Col 2:14 and Eph 2:15 for what was abolished. What is the significance of this vocabulary overlap? Prior studies (law-04, law-08) established that dogma is never used for the Decalogue.

8. **Acts 21:20-25 -- Later reference:** The council decision is later referenced alongside "many thousands of Jews which believe; and they are all zealous of the law." What does this reveal about Jewish believers' ongoing relationship to the law?

- [G4202](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4202/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} porneia (fornication) -- semantic range in Acts 15 context
- [G1482](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1482/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} ethnikos (Gentile) -- NT usage pattern
- [H1471](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1471/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} gowy (nation/Gentile) -- OT usage pattern

**Concept context (run concept_context.py):**
- Acts 15:10 (to find conceptual parallels for the "yoke" statement)
