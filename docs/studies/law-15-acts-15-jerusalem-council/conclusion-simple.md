# What Did the Jerusalem Council Decide About the Law?

**A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence**

---

The book of Acts records a pivotal moment in the early church: a formal council held in Jerusalem to answer a pressing question about Gentile converts and the law of Moses. This event, recorded in Acts 15, is often cited in debates about whether God's moral law still applies to believers today. Some argue that the council freed Gentiles from all law-keeping. Others hold that it only addressed ceremonial requirements while leaving the moral law intact. This summary walks through what the Bible actually says about what the council decided, what it means for the "we're Gentiles, so the law doesn't apply to us" objection, and what conclusions the evidence supports.

## The Question Before the Council

The dispute that triggered the Jerusalem Council is stated clearly in the text. Certain men had come from Judea teaching the Gentile believers a specific doctrine:

> "Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved." (Acts 15:1)

Then at the council itself, believing Pharisees restated the demand more fully:

> "That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses." (Acts 15:5)

The question was not abstract. It was concrete and salvation-related: must Gentile converts undergo the full Jewish proselyte conversion process — circumcision and the entire Mosaic ceremonial system — in order to be saved? This was the matter the apostles gathered to settle.

## Peter's Response: The Yoke

Peter stood up and addressed the assembly. He reminded them that God had already shown His acceptance of the Gentiles by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He had to the Jewish believers. Then he challenged those pushing the circumcision requirement:

> "Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?" (Acts 15:10)

The "yoke" Peter refers to is the ceremonial proselyte demand — circumcision plus the entire Mosaic system as a requirement for salvation. The context makes this clear: the demand in verse 5 is what Peter calls a yoke in verse 10. He is not saying that God's moral commands are an unbearable burden. Elsewhere in Scripture, the commandments are called "holy, and just, and good" (Romans 7:12), "the law of liberty" (James 1:25), and "not grievous" (1 John 5:3). An "unbearable yoke" does not fit those descriptions. What does fit is the impossible task of earning salvation through ceremonial obedience — something "neither our fathers nor we were able to bear."

Peter concluded with a declaration of grace:

> "But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they." (Acts 15:11)

Salvation is by grace, for both Jews and Gentiles. That was Peter's point.

## James's Ruling and the Four Prohibitions

James, who presided over the council, delivered the ruling. He stated that the Gentile converts should not be troubled with the full ceremonial system, but should be given four specific requirements:

> "But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood." (Acts 15:20)

The council's letter to the Gentile churches confirmed this:

> "For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well." (Acts 15:28-29)

These four items are not random. Two of them — idolatry and fornication — are directly rooted in the Ten Commandments (the first and second commandments against idol worship, and the seventh commandment against sexual immorality). The other two — blood and things strangled — trace back to God's command to Noah long before Sinai:

> "But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat." (Genesis 9:4)

This command was given to all humanity through Noah. The laws against blood and sexual immorality were also applied to "the strangers that sojourn among you" in the Mosaic legislation (Leviticus 17:10, 12; 18:26), showing they were never limited to ethnic Israelites.

The council called these items "necessary things" — not "the only things." This is an important distinction. The Greek word translated "necessary" means obligatory, but the council did not say "these are the only commands that apply to you." The fact that the council retained fornication — a moral command — shows it was not releasing Gentiles from moral obligations. It was releasing them from the ceremonial proselyte system.

## The Key to Understanding: Acts 15:21

Immediately after listing the four prohibitions, James added an explanatory statement that is often overlooked:

> "For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day." (Acts 15:21)

The word "for" at the beginning of this sentence is crucial. It connects what follows to the ruling that preceded it. James is explaining why only four items needed to be put in writing: Moses is preached and read in the synagogues every Sabbath. The implication is that Gentile converts would continue attending Sabbath synagogue services, where they would learn the full scope of their moral obligations from the reading of Scripture.

This verse assumes an existing practice. We know from Acts 13:42-44 that Gentiles were already attending Sabbath synagogue services. James did not need to command something that was already happening. He simply noted it as the reason the written decree could be limited to four urgent items — the rest of the instruction would come through the weekly reading of Moses.

## Did the Council Abolish the Moral Law?

Some argue that because the council only listed four items, the moral law (including commandments against murder, theft, lying, covetousness, and Sabbath-breaking) no longer applies to Gentile believers. This argument has serious problems.

First, the argument from silence does not hold. The council's failure to list every moral command does not mean those commands were abolished. James explained that further instruction would come through the Sabbath reading of Moses. The four items were the most urgent matters for people coming out of paganism — not an exhaustive moral code.

Second, Paul's later teaching to Gentile churches includes extensive moral law content. Writing to the believers in Rome, Paul listed specific commandments from the Decalogue:

> "For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law." (Romans 13:9-10)

Paul did not tell the Gentile churches that the Decalogue was irrelevant to them. He quoted it as the standard that love fulfills.

Third, Paul explicitly stated what matters after the council:

> "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God." (1 Corinthians 7:19)

This is a remarkable statement. Paul dismisses the very ceremonial rite the council addressed (circumcision) while affirming that the commandments of God are what matter. The council released Gentiles from circumcision, not from God's commandments.

Fourth, the book of Revelation, written decades after the council, still condemns idolatry and fornication in the churches:

> "But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication." (Revelation 2:14)

The same combination of sins addressed in Acts 15 is condemned in the post-apostolic churches, confirming their ongoing moral relevance.

## The "We're Gentiles" Objection

A common objection says: "The law was given to Israel, and we are Gentiles, so it does not apply to us." The New Testament addresses this objection directly — not by agreeing with it, but by redefining who believers are.

Paul told the Ephesian believers:

> "Remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh...at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel...But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh...Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God." (Ephesians 2:11-13, 19)

Note the past tense: "ye being in time past Gentiles." And the present tense: "ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens." Paul told the Corinthians the same thing:

> "Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led." (1 Corinthians 12:2)

Again, past tense. Paul wrote to the Galatians:

> "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." (Galatians 3:28-29)

Believers in Christ are Abraham's seed. Paul described them as wild olive branches grafted into Israel's olive tree:

> "And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee." (Romans 11:17-18)

Peter applied Israel's own covenantal identity language to the church:

> "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people...Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God." (1 Peter 2:9-10)

The pattern is consistent across multiple authors: converted believers are no longer "Gentiles" in the covenantal sense. They are grafted into Israel, they are Abraham's seed, they are fellow-citizens with the saints, they are the people of God. The new covenant itself is made "with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah" (Jeremiah 31:31; Hebrews 8:8). There is no separate Gentile covenant. If believers participate in this covenant, they are part of Israel's covenant community.

The prophet Isaiah anticipated this very reality, describing foreigners who join themselves to the LORD:

> "Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer." (Isaiah 56:6-7)

Foreigners who join the LORD are expected to keep the Sabbath and take hold of His covenant. This is not a command limited to ethnic Israel.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

Honest study requires acknowledging what the text does not explicitly state:

- **Acts 15 does not explicitly command Sabbath-keeping for Gentiles.** James describes an existing practice of Sabbath synagogue attendance (verse 21), but the council does not issue a prescriptive Sabbath command in its ruling.

- **The text does not explicitly say "these four items are just the starting point."** The inference that the four prohibitions are a minimum rather than the totality comes from James's explanation about ongoing Sabbath instruction and from Paul's later Decalogue teaching — it is a well-supported conclusion, but it is not stated in so many words.

- **The text does not say the council created a two-tier moral system** — one standard for Jewish believers and another for Gentile believers. Acts 21:25 restates the Gentile ruling, and Acts 21:20 notes that Jewish believers remained "zealous of the law," but the text does not explicitly address whether the moral standard differs between the two groups.

- **The text does not explicitly state that "Gentile identity changes at conversion."** This conclusion is drawn from the consistent past-tense grammar multiple authors use for Gentile identity and the present-tense language for incorporation into Israel. It is a strong pattern, but no single verse says "you are no longer a Gentile."

## Conclusion

The Jerusalem Council answered a specific question: must Gentile believers be circumcised and keep the law of Moses to be saved? The answer was no. The council released Gentiles from the ceremonial proselyte system, not from God's moral commandments. The four "necessary things" specified by the council include two Decalogue commands (idolatry and fornication) and two pre-Sinai universal commands (blood and things strangled). James explained that Moses would provide ongoing instruction through the Sabbath reading of Scripture.

Paul's later writings confirm that the moral law remained in force: he quoted the Decalogue to Gentile churches, declared that "circumcision is nothing...but the keeping of the commandments of God," and stated "we establish the law." The "we're Gentiles" objection is addressed by the New Testament's consistent teaching that converted believers are grafted into Israel, are Abraham's seed, are fellow-citizens with the saints, and are the people of God. The new covenant is made with the house of Israel, and believers are incorporated into that covenant through faith.

The biblical evidence shows that Acts 15 is about releasing Gentile converts from ceremonial requirements for salvation — not about abolishing God's moral law.
