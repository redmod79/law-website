## Question
What did the Jerusalem Council decide about the law? Investigate the specific question posed (Acts 15:5), Peter's speech about the "yoke" (v.10), James's ruling and the four prohibitions (v.20,29), and the critical statement about Moses being read in synagogues every sabbath (v.21). Also address whether believers remain "Gentiles" after conversion.
