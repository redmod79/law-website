## Summary of Prior Law-Series Findings Relevant to This Study

### law-04 (Ceremonial Laws)
- Classified circumcision as a ceremonial law delivered through Moses
- Acts 15:10 identified as Peter calling circumcision + law-of-Moses requirement a "yoke"
- 1 Cor 7:19 dismisses circumcision while affirming commandments of God
- Shadow/type vocabulary (skia, typos) applied exclusively to ceremonial system, never to the Decalogue

### law-07 (Law of Moses)
- "The law of Moses" refers to comprehensive Pentateuchal legislation
- When specific content is identified, it is ceremonial (7x), civil (3x), curses (2x), or literary (2x)
- Acts 15:5 classified: circumcision singled out alongside "the law of Moses" with two infinitives joined by te

### law-08 (Abolished at Cross)
- None of the seven NT abolition passages names the Decalogue as abolished
- The vocabulary dogma (G1378) is used in the two primary abolition texts and is never used for the Decalogue
- Acts 15:28-29 releases Gentiles from circumcision and ceremonial law but retains moral prohibition (fornication)

### law-09 (Old Covenant / New Covenant)
- The old covenant's weakness was the people, not the law
- The new covenant writes the SAME law on hearts
- Five differences between covenants: location, power, mediator, basis, forgiveness -- none is a change in the law's content

### law-10 (New Covenant and Law)
- New covenant passages consistently describe God's pre-existing moral law being written on hearts by the Spirit
- Possessive pronouns ("MY law," "MY laws") identify the content as God's existing law

### law-11 (Written on Hearts)
- Identifies the Decalogue as the law written on hearts

### law-13 (Jesus and Sabbath)
- Luke uses identical Greek (kata to eiothos) for both Jesus' sabbath synagogue custom (Luke 4:16) and Paul's (Acts 17:2)
- Sabbath-keeping "remaineth" (sabbatismos, Heb 4:9)

### law-14 (Jesus' Law Teachings)
- No passage records Jesus abolishing any moral commandment
- He affirms, deepens, and defends the moral law throughout

## Relevance to Current Study

These prior studies provide context for understanding:
1. What "the law of Moses" meant in Acts 15:5 (law-07)
2. What Peter's "yoke" refers to (law-04: the ceremonial/Mosaic system as soteriological requirement)
3. The significance of dogma vocabulary in Acts 16:4 / Eph 2:15 / Col 2:14 (law-08)
4. Whether the new covenant abolishes or establishes the moral law (law-09, law-10)
5. The sabbath synagogue customs referenced in Acts 15:21 (law-13)
