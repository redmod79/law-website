# Verse Analysis: What Did the Jerusalem Council Decide About the Law?

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Acts 15:1 — The Presenting Issue
**Context:** Certain men from Judaea come to Antioch and teach the Gentile brethren a soteriological requirement.
**Direct statement:** "Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved." The demand is circumcision *for salvation* — a soteriological requirement.
**Key observations:** The issue is not whether Gentiles should live moral lives. The issue is whether physical circumcision is a salvation requirement. The phrase "after the manner of Moses" (kata to ethos Mouseos) links circumcision to the broader Mosaic system.
**Cross-references:** Gal 2:3-4 — Titus "was not compelled to be circumcised." Gal 5:1-4 — "if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing." Prior study (law-04) classified circumcision as ceremonial.

### Acts 15:5 — The Pharisees' Compound Demand
**Context:** Believing Pharisees (pepisteukotas, Perfect Active Participle — genuinely converted believers) expand the demand beyond Acts 15:1.
**Direct statement:** "It was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses." The Greek has two infinitives joined by te: (1) peritemnein (to circumcise), connected by te to (2) parangellein terein ton nomon Mouseos (to command to keep the law of Moses). The te particle joins these as a compound demand.
**Key observations:** The demand is twofold: circumcision AND the entire "law of Moses." Prior study (law-07) established that "the law of Moses" refers to the comprehensive Pentateuchal legislation. When specific content is identifiable, it is ceremonial (7x), civil (3x), curses (2x), or literary (2x). The phrase encompasses the whole Mosaic system, not the moral law alone. The Pharisees' demand is for Gentiles to undergo the full proselyte conversion process.
**Greek grammar:** The particle te (G5037) is connective, making circumcision and law-keeping a single compound requirement. The present active infinitive terein (to keep/observe) suggests ongoing, continuous observance.

### Acts 15:6-7a — The Council Convenes
**Context:** The apostles and elders assemble to consider the matter. "Much disputing" precedes Peter's speech.
**Direct statement:** The matter is taken seriously enough to require formal deliberation.

### Acts 15:7b-9 — Peter's Speech: God's Acceptance of Gentiles
**Context:** Peter recounts Cornelius's conversion (Acts 10).
**Direct statement:** God "made choice" that Gentiles would hear the gospel through Peter; God gave them the Holy Spirit "even as he did unto us"; God "put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith."
**Key observations:** Peter's argument is experiential and theological — God Himself accepted the Gentiles without circumcision, purifying them by faith, not by ceremonial compliance. The phrase "no difference" (outhen diakrinen) between Jew and Gentile is significant for the identity question. God's acceptance was on the basis of faith, not ceremonial law-keeping.

### Acts 15:10 — Peter's "Yoke" Statement
**Context:** Peter draws a rhetorical conclusion from God's acceptance of Gentiles.
**Direct statement:** "Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"
**Key observations:**

1. **What is the "yoke"?** The yoke (zygos, G2218) is what was demanded in v.5: circumcision + keeping the law of Moses as a soteriological requirement. Peter says "neither our fathers nor we" were able to bear it — meaning even Israel could not achieve salvation through full ceremonial law-keeping. This does not say the moral law is a yoke; it says the entire ceremonial system as a means of salvation is unbearable.

2. **Greek grammar:** The aorist ischysamen (we were able) looks back over Israel's entire history. The oute...oute (neither...nor) construction is emphatic — no generation of Israel bore this yoke successfully.

3. **Comparison with Jesus' yoke:** Jesus says "my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" (Mat 11:29-30). The same word zygos is used. The Pharisees' demand imposes a yoke; Jesus offers a different yoke. The contrast is between the ceremonial system as a salvation mechanism and the gospel of grace.

4. **Comparison with Gal 5:1:** "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage." Paul uses the same imagery for the same issue — requiring circumcision and law-keeping for justification.

5. **Prior study context:** Law-04 identified Peter's yoke as the ceremonial/Mosaic system requirement, not the moral law. The moral law is called "holy, just, good, spiritual" (Rom 7:12, 14), "the law of liberty" (Jas 1:25; 2:12), and "not grievous" (1 Jn 5:3) — vocabulary incompatible with an unbearable yoke.

### Acts 15:11 — Salvation by Grace
**Context:** Peter's concluding statement.
**Direct statement:** "We believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they."
**Key observations:** Peter affirms salvation by grace for both Jews and Gentiles. The "even as they" is significant — Jews are saved the same way Gentiles are (by grace), not the reverse. This undermines the demand that Gentiles must become law-keepers for salvation.

### Acts 15:12 — Barnabas and Paul's Testimony
**Context:** After Peter's speech, the assembly listens to Barnabas and Paul.
**Direct statement:** They declare "what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them."
**Key observations:** The evidence is God's work among uncircumcised Gentiles — further confirming God's acceptance without the ceremonial system.

### Acts 15:13-18 — James's Speech: Amos 9:11-12
**Context:** James renders the definitive ruling as leader of the Jerusalem assembly.
**Direct statement:** James quotes Amos 9:11-12 (from the LXX): "After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David...that the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called."
**Key observations:** The prophecy describes Gentiles being called by God's name — incorporated into God's people — without becoming proselytes. The phrase "upon whom my name is called" (eph' hous epikeklētai to onoma mou) applies to the Gentiles Israel's covenantal language ("my name"). This supports the identity transformation discussed below.

### Acts 15:19-20 — James's Ruling and the Four Prohibitions
**Context:** James pronounces his judgment.
**Direct statement:** "My sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: but that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood."
**Key observations:**

1. **"Trouble not" (me parenochleo):** The council's concern is not to burden Gentile converts with the ceremonial system. The four items are called "necessary things" (epanankes) in v.28.

2. **The four prohibitions and their categories:**
   - **Pollutions of idols (alisgamaton ton eidolon):** Idolatry is forbidden in the 1st and 2nd Decalogue commandments (Exo 20:3-5). This is moral law.
   - **Fornication (porneia, G4202):** Sexual immorality is forbidden in the 7th commandment (Exo 20:14). This is moral law. Paul explicitly commands "flee fornication" (1 Cor 6:18) and names it a "work of the flesh" (Gal 5:19).
   - **Things strangled (pniktos, G4156):** This relates to the manner of killing animals for food — consuming blood-containing meat. The blood prohibition predates Sinai (Gen 9:4) and was given to all humanity through Noah.
   - **Blood (haima, G129):** The prohibition on consuming blood is given in Gen 9:4 (to Noah, pre-Sinai, universal), repeated in Lev 17:10-14 (explicitly applying to "the strangers that sojourn among you"), and is connected to the theological principle that "the life of the flesh is in the blood" (Lev 17:11).

3. **Are these four minimal or comprehensive?** Two of the four (idolatry and fornication) are explicitly Decalogue commandments. The other two (strangled and blood) have pre-Sinai, universal scope through the Noahic covenant. The council is not providing an exhaustive new moral code; it is specifying items that Gentile converts from pagan backgrounds would most urgently need instruction about. Rev 2:14, 20 later addresses the same combination (idols + fornication) in the churches, confirming their ongoing moral relevance.

### Acts 15:21 — "Moses Read Every Sabbath"
**Context:** James provides the reason (gar, "for") for specifying only four items.
**Direct statement:** "For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day."
**Key observations:**

1. **The function of v.21 in James's argument:** The gar (for) is explanatory — it explains WHY only four items are specified. Moses is already being preached and read in synagogues every Sabbath. This means: (a) the Gentile converts will learn the rest of their moral obligations as they hear Moses read in the synagogues; the four items are the urgent starting points, not the complete list.

2. **Greek grammar:** The present tenses echei (has) and anaginoskomenos (being read) describe an ongoing, current reality. The distributive kata pan sabbaton means "each and every Sabbath." James states this as a present fact — not a past practice or a prediction.

3. **Does this assume Sabbath synagogue attendance?** James's statement only functions as an explanation if the Gentile converts will actually be present in the synagogues on the Sabbath to hear Moses read. If they were not expected to attend, v.21 has no explanatory force for the preceding ruling.

4. **NT parallel evidence:** Luke uses identical vocabulary for Jesus's Sabbath custom (Luk 4:16: kata to eiothos) and Paul's Sabbath custom (Acts 17:2: kata to eiothos). Acts 13:42-44 records Gentiles requesting Paul to preach again "the next sabbath" and "almost the whole city" gathering on the Sabbath. Acts 18:4 records Paul reasoning "in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks."

5. **The text does not explicitly command Sabbath-keeping** for Gentiles. It describes an existing practice in which Gentile converts participated. The evidence is descriptive, not prescriptive, in this particular verse.

### Acts 15:22-29 — The Formal Letter
**Context:** The council writes a formal letter to the Gentile churches.
**Direct statement:** (a) "Certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment" (v.24). (b) "It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things" (v.28). (c) The four items are repeated (v.29).
**Key observations:**

1. **"We gave no such commandment" (v.24):** The apostles explicitly disavow the Judaizers' demand. The unauthorized teaching was "ye must be circumcised, and keep the law" — the soteriological requirement of the ceremonial system.

2. **"Seemed good to the Holy Ghost" (v.28):** The council claims divine authority for its decision. The Holy Spirit is named as co-author of the ruling.

3. **"No greater burden" (v.28):** The Greek baros (burden/weight) combined with epanankes (necessary) indicates: the four items are the minimum essential requirements, not the maximum extent of Christian moral obligation. The phrasing "no greater burden than these necessary things" does not mean "you are free from all other moral obligation." It means "we will not impose the ceremonial system on you; these four things are necessary."

4. **The letter's vocabulary shift:** V.20 uses alisgamaton ton eidolon (pollutions of idols); v.29 uses eidolothyton (things sacrificed to idols). The concept is the same; the vocabulary is refined for the written document.

### Acts 16:4 — Dogmata Delivered
**Context:** Paul and Timothy deliver the council's decisions to the churches.
**Direct statement:** "They delivered them the decrees (dogmata, G1378) for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem."
**Key observations:** The council's decisions are called dogmata — the same word used in Col 2:14 and Eph 2:15 for what was abolished at the cross. This vocabulary overlap is significant. Three of five NT uses of dogma are civil/governmental decrees (Luk 2:1; Acts 17:7; Acts 16:4). The two abolition uses (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14) describe ceremonial ordinances. Prior studies (law-04, law-08, law-14) established that dogma is never used for the Decalogue.

### Acts 21:20-25 — Later Reference
**Context:** Years later, James and the elders in Jerusalem inform Paul about the situation.
**Direct statement:** (a) "How many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law" (v.20). (b) "As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication" (v.25).
**Key observations:**

1. **Jewish believers are "zealous of the law":** Believing Jews continued to observe the law. The council decision did not abolish the law for Jewish believers; it determined that Gentiles need not undergo proselyte conversion.

2. **The "no such thing" distinction (v.25):** The phrase "observe no such thing" refers to the ceremonial practices that Jewish believers continued. The four prohibitions remain in force for Gentile believers.

3. **Two-track observation:** The text presents Jewish believers keeping the law and Gentile believers keeping the four prohibitions. This describes the historical situation without prescribing a permanent two-track system.

## Gentile Identity After Conversion

### Ephesians 2:11-13 — Past-Tense Gentile Identity
**Context:** Paul addresses Gentile believers in Ephesus.
**Direct statement:** "Remember, that ye being in time past (pote) Gentiles in the flesh...at that time (to kairo ekeino) ye were (ete, imperfect) without Christ, being alienated (apellotriomenoi, perfect passive participle) from the commonwealth (politeias) of Israel...But NOW (nyni de) in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes (pote) were far off are made nigh (egenethete engys)."
**Key observations:**

1. **Temporal markers:** Pote (formerly/once) appears twice, marking Gentile identity as past. Ete (you were, imperfect) and to kairo ekeino (at that time) reinforce past tense. Nyni de (but now) creates a sharp contrast.

2. **Five past deprivations:** Without Christ, alienated from Israel's commonwealth, strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, without God in the world.

3. **The transformation:** From "far off" to "made nigh" (egenethete engys, aorist — a decisive, completed transformation).

### Ephesians 2:14-15 — The Wall Broken Down
**Context:** Paul explains how the transformation happened.
**Direct statement:** Christ "hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances (ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin)."
**Key observations:** The "middle wall of partition" was the barrier between Jew and Gentile — the ceremonial system that excluded Gentiles. What was abolished was "the law of commandments contained in ordinances" (en dogmasin) — the ceremonial regulations that created the division. Prior studies (law-08) established the three-layer narrowing construction: nomos → entolon → en dogmasin. The same epistle cites the 5th Decalogue commandment as binding (Eph 6:2-3), confirming the moral law was not what was abolished.

### Ephesians 2:19 — Fellow-Citizens
**Context:** Paul states the present reality.
**Direct statement:** "Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens (sympolitai, G4847) with the saints, and of the household of God."
**Key observations:** Sympolitai is a hapax legomenon. Combined with politeias (G4174, commonwealth) in v.12, the language describes full civic incorporation into Israel's community. The believers are no longer paroikoi (foreigners/sojourners) but sympolitai (fellow-citizens).

### 1 Corinthians 12:2 — "Ye WERE Gentiles"
**Context:** Paul addresses the Corinthian believers about spiritual gifts.
**Direct statement:** "Ye know that ye WERE (ete, imperfect) Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols."
**Key observations:** Paul uses the imperfect tense ete (you were), not the present tense. The temporal adverb hote (when) marks this as a completed past state. Paul identifies their Gentile identity with their pagan past — they WERE Gentiles when they were idol-worshippers. After conversion, a different identity applies.

### Galatians 3:28-29 — Neither Jew nor Greek
**Context:** Paul describes the new identity in Christ.
**Direct statement:** "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."
**Key observations:**

1. **Three pair negations:** Jew/Greek, bond/free, male/female — all erased in Christ.
2. **"Abraham's seed":** Those in Christ ARE (este, present tense) Abraham's seed — not honorary members but actual heirs of the Abrahamic promise.
3. **First-class conditional:** "If (ei) ye be Christ's" — assumed true for the audience. The conclusion (ara) follows: they ARE Abraham's seed.

### Romans 11:17-24 — Grafted into Israel's Olive Tree
**Context:** Paul uses the olive tree metaphor for God's people.
**Direct statement:** Gentile believers, described as a "wild olive tree" (agrielaios, G65), were "graffed in among" the natural branches and now "partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree."
**Key observations:**

1. **The tree is Israel's:** The root is Israel's patriarchs (the cultivated olive tree, kallielaios, G2565). Natural branches (Israel) were broken off through unbelief; wild branches (Gentiles) were grafted in through faith.
2. **The root sustains:** "Thou bearest not the root, but the root thee" (v.18). Gentile believers draw their spiritual sustenance from Israel's covenantal heritage.
3. **The grafting is incorporation:** Being grafted into a tree means becoming part of that tree. The wild olive becomes part of the cultivated olive tree — not a separate tree alongside it.

### 1 Peter 2:9-10 — Royal Priesthood, Holy Nation
**Context:** Peter addresses believers (primarily Gentile converts) using Israel's covenant language.
**Direct statement:** "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people...which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God."
**Key observations:** Peter applies Exodus 19:5-6 language ("a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation") to the church, including Gentile believers. The "in time past were not a people" echoes Hosea 2:23 — language originally about Israel's restoration applied to Gentile inclusion.

### Romans 9:24-26 — "My People"
**Context:** Paul quotes Hosea to explain God's calling of Gentiles.
**Direct statement:** "I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. And...there shall they be called the children of the living God."
**Key observations:** Those who "were not my people" (Gentiles) are now called "my people" and "children of the living God." The identity transformation is complete.

### Colossians 3:11 — Neither Greek nor Jew
**Context:** Paul describes the new creation in Christ.
**Direct statement:** "Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all."
**Key observations:** This expands the Gal 3:28 pairs to include "Barbarian, Scythian" — all ethnic and cultural categories dissolved in Christ.

### John 10:16 — One Fold, One Shepherd
**Context:** Jesus speaks of His mission.
**Direct statement:** "Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd."
**Key observations:** Jesus anticipates the incorporation of Gentiles ("other sheep") into one unified flock. Not two separate flocks with different obligations — one fold, one shepherd.

## The "We're Gentiles" Objection vs. the New Covenant

### The Objection Stated
The claim: "The law was only for Jews. We are Gentiles, so the law does not apply to us."

### The Evidence Against the Objection

1. **Believers are no longer identified as "Gentiles" by the NT writers:**
   - Eph 2:11: "ye being in time past (pote) Gentiles" — past tense
   - 1 Cor 12:2: "ye WERE (ete) Gentiles" — past tense
   - Eph 2:19: "no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens" — present reality
   - Gal 3:28: "there is neither Jew nor Greek" — the distinction is erased
   - 1 Pet 2:10: "in time past were not a people, but ARE NOW the people of God"

2. **Believers are grafted into Israel:**
   - Rom 11:17-24: Wild olive grafted into Israel's cultivated olive tree
   - Gal 3:29: "If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed"
   - Eph 2:12-13: Alienated from Israel's commonwealth → made nigh

3. **The new covenant is made with "the house of Israel":**
   - Jer 31:31: "I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah"
   - Heb 8:8, 10: Same — "I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel"
   - There is only ONE new covenant in Scripture. If Gentile believers participate in the new covenant, they must be part of "the house of Israel" in some sense — which is precisely what the grafting/adoption/incorporation passages describe.

4. **Israel is redefined by faith, not ethnicity:**
   - Rom 9:6: "They are not all Israel, which are of Israel"
   - Rom 2:28-29: "He is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart"
   - Phil 3:3: "We are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit"

5. **The OT anticipated Gentile inclusion with Sabbath-keeping:**
   - Isa 56:3, 6-8: "Sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD...every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; even them will I bring to my holy mountain."

---

## Patterns Identified

1. **The council's question was about the ceremonial system, not the moral law.** The presenting issue (v.1) was circumcision for salvation. The Pharisees expanded it to circumcision + keeping the law of Moses (v.5). The council addressed this specific demand. The moral law was not in dispute — fornication (a moral commandment) is retained in the ruling.

2. **The four prohibitions contain moral law content.** Idolatry (1st/2nd commandments) and fornication (7th commandment) are explicitly Decalogue prohibitions. Blood and strangled have pre-Sinai, universal scope (Gen 9:4). The council did not create a new moral code; it specified urgent items for converts from paganism.

3. **Acts 15:21 assumes ongoing Sabbath synagogue participation.** James's statement only functions as an explanation for why four items suffice (rather than a comprehensive list) if the Gentile converts will be present to hear Moses read on the Sabbath.

4. **The NT redefines believer identity away from the Jew/Gentile binary.** Multiple authors using different metaphors (citizenship, grafting, Abraham's seed, royal priesthood, one fold) describe the same reality: converted Gentiles are no longer "Gentiles" in the covenantal sense.

5. **The "yoke" (zygos) is the ceremonial system as a salvation mechanism, not the moral law.** The moral law is described with opposite vocabulary: "law of liberty" (Jas 1:25), "not grievous" (1 Jn 5:3), "perfect" (Psa 19:7).

## Connections Between Passages

### Acts 15 and Galatians
Galatians addresses the same issue — Judaizers requiring circumcision (Gal 2:3-4; 5:1-6; 6:12-13). Paul's vocabulary matches Peter's: "yoke of bondage" (Gal 5:1) parallels "yoke...which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear" (Acts 15:10). Both conclude that faith/grace, not circumcision/ceremonial law, is the means of salvation.

### Acts 15:21 and Luke-Acts Sabbath Pattern
Luke — the author of both Luke and Acts — records Jesus's Sabbath custom (Luk 4:16, kata to eiothos), Paul's Sabbath custom (Acts 17:2, kata to eiothos), Gentile Sabbath attendance (Acts 13:42-44), and James's statement about Sabbath synagogue reading (Acts 15:21). The same author presents a consistent pattern of Sabbath observance across Jesus, Paul, and the early church.

### Eph 2:11-22 and Rom 11:17-24
Both passages describe the same reality through different metaphors: Ephesians uses citizenship language (aliens → fellow-citizens), Romans uses botanical language (wild branches → grafted into the cultivated tree). Both describe Gentile incorporation into Israel's covenantal community.

### The New Covenant and Gentile Identity
Jer 31:31-33 and Heb 8:8-10 make the new covenant with "the house of Israel." If Gentile believers participate in this covenant (and the entire NT assumes they do), they must be part of Israel in the covenantal sense. This is precisely what the grafting (Rom 11), citizenship (Eph 2), seed (Gal 3), and identity (1 Pet 2) passages describe.

## Word Study Insights

### [G2218](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2218/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} zygos (yoke)
The word appears 6 times in the NT. In Acts 15:10, it describes the ceremonial system as a salvation requirement. In Mat 11:29-30, Jesus offers His own yoke — "easy" and "light." The contrast is between the impossible burden of earning salvation through law-keeping and the gracious relationship Jesus offers.

### [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} dogma (decree/ordinance)
Five NT occurrences: 3 for civil/governmental decrees (Luk 2:1; Acts 16:4; 17:7) and 2 for abolished ceremonial ordinances (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14). The council's decisions are dogmata (Acts 16:4) — decrees about what ceremonial requirements do NOT apply to Gentiles. The same vocabulary is used for what was abolished at the cross. Dogma is never used for the Decalogue.

### [G4174](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4174/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} politeia / [G4847](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4847/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} sympolitai (citizenship vocabulary)
Politeia appears only twice in the NT (Acts 22:28 for Roman citizenship; Eph 2:12 for Israel's commonwealth). Sympolitai appears only once (Eph 2:19). This rare vocabulary describes Gentile believers' incorporation into Israel's civic/covenantal community.

### [G65](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g65/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} agrielaios / [G2565](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2565/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} kallielaios (olive tree vocabulary)
Agrielaios (wild olive) appears twice (Rom 11:17, 24). Kallielaios (cultivated olive) appears once (Rom 11:24). The botanical metaphor describes Gentile incorporation into Israel's tree — sharing Israel's root and fatness, not establishing a separate tree.

## Difficult Passages

### Peter's "Yoke" — Does It Include the Moral Law?
Peter calls the Pharisees' demand "a yoke which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear" (Acts 15:10). The Abolished position infers that this includes the moral law — that the entire Torah is an unbearable yoke. The text, however, identifies the yoke as the compound demand of v.5: circumcision + keeping the law of Moses as a soteriological requirement. The moral law is described elsewhere as "holy, just, good" (Rom 7:12), "perfect" (Psa 19:7), "law of liberty" (Jas 1:25), and "not grievous" (1 Jn 5:3). The vocabulary of "unbearable yoke" is not used elsewhere for the moral law; it is used for the ceremonial system and the impossible task of achieving salvation through perfect law-keeping (cf. Gal 5:3: "a debtor to do the whole law").

### Acts 15:28-29 — Only Four Requirements?
The Abolished position infers that since only four items are specified, Gentile believers are free from all other moral obligation. The text does not draw this conclusion. V.28's "no greater burden than these necessary things" addresses the specific dispute about the ceremonial system, not about moral obligation in general. V.21 explains why only four items are specified: Moses is read every Sabbath, so Gentile converts will learn their full moral obligations through ongoing instruction. Further, the NT epistles (written after the council) contain extensive moral instruction to Gentile churches, including the Decalogue content (Rom 13:8-10; Eph 4-6; Col 3; etc.).

### Galatians 3:24-25 — No Longer Under a Schoolmaster
Paul says "after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster." The Abolished position reads this as the moral law being terminated. Prior studies (law-08) noted that the referent of "the law" in Gal 3 is ambiguous (Gate 1 failure in Tree 3). The "schoolmaster" (paidagogos) was a guardian leading to a destination (Christ); arriving at the destination does not destroy the destination. Paul in the same epistle affirms "the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith" — the purpose is justification, not moral guidance. The same Paul says "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law" (Rom 3:31).
