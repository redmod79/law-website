## [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- dogma (decree/ordinance)
**Original:** δόγμα
**Transliteration:** dogma
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun
**Definition:** From the base of dokeo; a law (civil, ceremonial, or ecclesiastical).
**BLB Count:** 5 NT occurrences

### All 5 NT Occurrences
| Verse | Translation | Context |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Luke 2:1 | "a decree" | Decree from Caesar Augustus (civil decree) |
| Acts 16:4 | "decrees" | The council decrees delivered to churches |
| Acts 17:7 | "decrees" | Decrees of Caesar (civil decree) |
| Ephesians 2:15 | "ordinances" | "the law of commandments contained in ordinances" -- abolished |
| Colossians 2:14 | "ordinances" | "handwriting of ordinances" -- nailed to cross |

### Significance
The word dogma is used for the Jerusalem Council's decisions (Acts 16:4) AND for what was abolished at the cross (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14). Three of five uses are clearly civil/governmental decrees (Luke 2:1; Acts 17:7; Acts 16:4). The two "abolished" uses (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14) describe ceremonial ordinances. Prior studies (law-04, law-08) established that dogma is never used for the Decalogue.

## [G4174](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4174/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- politeia (citizenship/commonwealth)
**Original:** πολιτεία
**Transliteration:** politeia
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** Citizenship; concretely, a community.
**BLB Count:** 2 NT occurrences

### All Occurrences
| Verse | Translation | Context |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Acts 22:28 | "freedom" | Roman citizenship -- "With a great sum obtained I this freedom" |
| Ephesians 2:12 | "commonwealth" | "aliens from the commonwealth of Israel" |

### Significance
Used only twice in the NT. In Eph 2:12 it describes what Gentile believers were previously alienated from -- Israel's civic/covenantal community. The word implies full membership in a political/social body.

---

## [G4847](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4847/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- sympolites (fellow-citizen)
**Original:** συμπολίτης
**Transliteration:** sympolites
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** A native of the same town; figuratively, a co-citizen.
**BLB Count:** 1 NT occurrence

### The Single Occurrence
- **Ephesians 2:19** -- "fellowcitizens with the saints"

### Significance
A hapax legomenon (used only once). Combined with politeia (Eph 2:12), Paul's vocabulary describes Gentile believers transitioning from being "aliens from the commonwealth of Israel" to being "fellow-citizens with the saints." The citizenship language implies incorporation into Israel's covenantal community.

## [G65](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g65/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- agrielaios (wild olive tree)
**Original:** ἀγριέλαιος
**Transliteration:** agrielaios
**Part of Speech:** adjective
**Definition:** From agrios and elaia; an oleaster (wild olive tree).
**BLB Count:** 2 occurrences

### Occurrences
- **Romans 11:17** -- "thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them"
- **Romans 11:24** -- "cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature"

---

## [G2565](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2565/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- kallielaios (cultivated olive tree)
**Original:** καλλιέλαιος
**Transliteration:** kallielaios
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** From the base of kalos and elaia; a cultivated olive tree.
**BLB Count:** 1 occurrence

### The Single Occurrence
- **Romans 11:24** -- "graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree"

### Significance (with G65)
The agrielaios/kallielaios pair describes Gentile believers (wild olive) being grafted into Israel's tree (cultivated olive). The grafting metaphor means Gentiles draw their sustenance from Israel's root and fatness. Paul warns: "thou bearest not the root, but the root thee" (Rom 11:18).

---

## [G4202](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4202/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- porneia (fornication)

### Semantic Range
The word covers a broad range of sexual immorality: adultery, incest, prostitution, and figuratively idolatry. In the Acts 15 context, it appears alongside idolatry, blood, and strangled things, all of which have pre-Sinai and universal moral significance.

## [G1482](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1482/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- ethnikos (Gentile/heathen)
**Original:** ἐθνικός
**Transliteration:** ethnikos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** National ("ethnic"); specially a Gentile; heathen.
**BLB Count:** 2 KJV occurrences (but used more in critical text)

### Occurrences
- **Matthew 5:47** -- "heathen" (do not even the publicans do the same?)
- **Matthew 6:7** -- "heathen" (use not vain repetitions)
- **Matthew 18:17** -- "heathen man" (let him be unto thee as an heathen)
- **3 John 1:7** -- "heathen" (taking nothing of the Gentiles)

### Note
This is the adjective form. The noun form ethnos (G1484) is far more common (164 occurrences). In 1 Cor 12:2, Paul uses ethnos (ἔθνη) with the imperfect tense ἦτε ("you were Gentiles"), placing it in the past.

## [H1471](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1471/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- gowy (nation/Gentile)
**Original:** גּוֹי
**Transliteration:** gowy
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** A foreign nation; hence a Gentile; also figuratively a troop of animals, or a flight of locusts.
**BLB Count:** 558 occurrences (607 KJV)

| nations | 97 | 16.0% |

| the heathen | 54 | 8.9% |
| nation | 50 | 8.2% |
| Gentiles (various) | ~28 | ~4.6% |

### Significance
The OT word for "nations/Gentiles." Notably, Israel itself is called a gowy in Exodus 19:6 ("a holy nation") and Genesis 12:2 ("a great nation"). The word does not inherently mean "pagan" -- it means "nation/people." Context determines whether it refers to Israel or to foreign nations.
