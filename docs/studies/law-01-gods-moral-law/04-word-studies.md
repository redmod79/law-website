## 1. HEBREW TERMS FOR LAW

- **Transliteration:** towrah
- **Pronunciation:** to-raw
- **Part of Speech:** feminine noun
- **Root:** from yarah (H3384), "to throw, cast, shoot" -- hence "direction, instruction, teaching"

- **Primary translations:** "the law" (60x), "of the law" (28x), "law" (24x), "thy law" (20x), "in the law" (19x), "my law" (10x)
- **Semantic range:** Encompasses the full range from individual instruction/direction to the entire body of divine revelation. The root meaning of "direction/instruction" shows the law is not arbitrary decree but God's teaching aimed at guiding His people.

- **Semantic range:** Emphasizes the authoritative nature of God's law -- it is not mere suggestion but divine command. Used both for individual commands and for the body of commands collectively.
- **Key passages for this study:**
  - Genesis 26:5 -- "Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my **commandments** (mitsvah), my statutes, and my laws" (Pre-Sinai!)
  - Exodus 20:6 -- "shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my **commandments** (mitsvah)"

- **Primary translations:** "the statutes" (14x), "thy statutes" (14x), "statutes" (13x), "a statute" (7x), "his statutes" (7x)
- **Semantic range:** The root "to cut in, inscribe" connects to the physical engraving of law on stone. Statutes are inscribed, permanent decrees -- not temporary adjustments.
- **Key passages for this study:**
  - Psalm 119:5 -- "O that my ways were directed to keep thy **statutes** (choq)!"
  - Ezekiel 36:27 -- "cause you to walk in my **statutes** (choq), and ye shall keep my judgments"
  - Psalm 148:6 -- "He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a **decree** (choq) which shall not pass"

### [H4941](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4941/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: mishpat (מִשְׁפָּט) -- "Judgment/Ordinance"

- **Semantic range:** Covers judicial decisions, case law, the principle of justice itself. When used of God's law, it emphasizes that His commands are expressions of His perfect justice.
- **Key passages for this study:**
  - Psalm 19:9 -- "the **judgments** (mishpat) of the LORD are true and righteous altogether"
  - Psalm 111:7 -- "The works of his hands are verity and **judgment** (mishpat); all his commandments are sure"

### [H676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h676/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: etsba (אֶצְבַּע) -- "Finger"
- **Transliteration:** etsba
- **Pronunciation:** ets-bah
- **Part of Speech:** feminine noun
- **Definition:** Something to seize with, i.e. a finger; by analogy, a toe
- **KJV occurrences:** 34 total
- **Primary translations:** "with his finger" (9x), "his finger" (3x), "finger" (2x), "fingers" (2x)
- **Theological significance:** The "finger of God" represents God's direct, personal action. Used only twice of writing -- both times for the Ten Commandments (Exodus 31:18; Deuteronomy 9:10). This distinguishes the Decalogue from all other legislation: it alone was directly inscribed by God Himself.
- **Key passages for this study:**
  - Exodus 8:15 -- "the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the **finger** (etsba) of God" (divine power)
  - Exodus 31:18 -- "tables of stone, written with the **finger** (etsba) of God"

  - Psalm 8:3 -- "When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy **fingers** (etsba)" (divine craftsmanship)

### [H5703](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5703/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: ad (עַד) -- "Perpetuity/Forever"
- **Transliteration:** ad
- **Pronunciation:** ad
- **Part of Speech:** masculine noun
- **Root:** from adah, "to advance"

- **Primary translations:** "for ever" (25x), "and ever" (14x), "everlasting" (2x), "eternity" (1x), "perpetually" (1x)
- **Theological significance:** When applied to God's law, this word indicates absolute permanence without terminus. The law shares in God's own eternal nature.
- **Key passages for this study:**
  - Psalm 111:3 -- "his righteousness endureth **for ever** (ad)"
  - Psalm 111:8 -- "They stand fast **for ever** (ad) and ever" (commandments)

## 2. GREEK TERMS FOR LAW

### [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: nomos (νόμος) -- "Law"
- **Transliteration:** nomos
- **Pronunciation:** nom-os
- **Part of Speech:** masculine noun
- **Root:** from nemo, "to parcel out, distribute"
- **Definition:** Anything established, anything received by usage, a custom, a law, a command
- **KJV occurrences:** 169 total
- **Primary translations:** "law" (95x), "the law" (49x), "of the law" (14x)
- **Semantic range:** In the NT, nomos is used in multiple senses:
  1. The moral law / Ten Commandments (Rom 7:7,12,14,22; 13:8-10; Jas 2:10-12)
  2. The Pentateuch / books of Moses (Luk 24:44; Jhn 1:45)
  3. The entire OT Scripture (Jhn 10:34; 15:25)
  4. Principles or systems (Rom 3:27 "law of faith"; Rom 7:21,23; 8:2)
  5. The ceremonial/civil regulations (Heb 7:5,16,28; 10:1)
- **Critical distinction for this study:** Context determines which sense of "nomos" is intended. When Paul says "the law is holy, just, good, spiritual" (Rom 7:12,14), he speaks of the moral law. When Hebrews speaks of the law as a "shadow" (10:1), it speaks of ceremonial observances.
- **Key passages:**
  - Romans 7:12 -- "the **law** (nomos) is holy"
  - Romans 7:14 -- "the **law** (nomos) is spiritual"
  - Romans 7:22 -- "I delight in the **law** (nomos) of God after the inward man"
  - Romans 3:31 -- "we establish the **law** (nomos)"
  - Matthew 5:17-18 -- "Think not that I am come to destroy the **law** (nomos)"
  - James 1:25 -- "the perfect **law** (nomos) of liberty"
  - James 2:12 -- "the **law** (nomos) of liberty"

### [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: entole (ἐντολή) -- "Commandment"
- **Transliteration:** entole
- **Pronunciation:** en-tol-ay
- **Part of Speech:** feminine noun
- **Root:** from entellomai, "to command, charge"
- **Definition:** Injunction, i.e. an authoritative prescription
- **KJV occurrences:** 43 total
- **Primary translations:** "commandment" (23x), "commandments" (12x), "precept" (2x)
- **Semantic range:** Used of both divine and human commands. In the NT, frequently used specifically for the commandments of God in the moral/ethical sense.
- **Critical end-time usage:**
  - Revelation 12:17 -- "which keep the **commandments** (entole) of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ"
  - Revelation 14:12 -- "they that keep the **commandments** (entole) of God, and the faith of Jesus"
  - Revelation 22:14 -- "they that do his **commandments** (entole)"
  - 1 John 5:3 -- "this is the love of God, that we keep his **commandments** (entole)"

## 3. GREEK TERMS FOR LAW ATTRIBUTES

### [G40](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g40/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: hagios (ἅγιος) -- "Holy"
- **Transliteration:** hagios
- **Pronunciation:** hag-ee-os
- **Part of Speech:** adjective
- **Root:** from hagos, "an awful/sacred thing"
- **Definition:** Sacred (physically, pure; morally, blameless; ceremonially, consecrated)
- **KJV occurrences:** 219 total
- **Primary translations:** "holy" (51x), "saints" (47x), "Holy" (37x)
- **Key use:** Romans 7:12 -- "the law is **holy** (hagios), and the commandment **holy** (hagios), and just, and good"
- **Significance:** The same word used for God's holiness (Revelation 4:8 "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty") is used for the law. The law is holy because it proceeds from a holy God and reflects His holy character.

### [G4152](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4152/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: pneumatikos (πνευματικός) -- "Spiritual"
- **Transliteration:** pneumatikos
- **Pronunciation:** pnyoo-mat-ik-os
- **Part of Speech:** adjective
- **Root:** from pneuma, "spirit"
- **Definition:** Non-carnal, i.e. ethereal (as opposed to gross), or (divinely) spiritual
- **KJV occurrences:** 26 total
- **Primary translations:** "spiritual" (13x), "spiritual things" (3x), "is spiritual" (3x)
- **Key use:** Romans 7:14 -- "we know that the law is **spiritual** (pneumatikos): but I am carnal, sold under sin"
- **Significance:** The law is not merely an external code but a spiritual reality. It addresses the inner person (cf. the 10th commandment against coveting, which is entirely internal). The contrast in Romans 7:14 is between the spiritual nature of the law and the carnal/fleshly nature of fallen humanity.

### [G1345](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1345/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: dikaioma (δικαίωμα) -- "Righteous Requirement"
- **Transliteration:** dikaioma
- **Pronunciation:** dik-ah-yo-mah
- **Part of Speech:** neuter noun
- **Root:** from dikaioo, "to justify, declare righteous"
- **Definition:** An equitable deed; by implication, a statute or decision
- **KJV occurrences:** 10 total
- **Primary translations:** "ordinances" (3x), "righteousness" (3x), "judgment" (1x), "justification" (1x)
- **KEY use for this study:** Romans 8:4 -- "That the **righteousness** (dikaioma) of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit"
- **Significance:** This word shows the law has a "righteous requirement" that God intends to be fulfilled in believers through the Spirit. The new covenant does not abolish the law's righteous standard but provides the power (the Spirit) to meet it.

### [G5046](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5046/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: teleios (τέλειος) -- "Perfect"
- **Transliteration:** teleios
- **Pronunciation:** tel-i-os
- **Part of Speech:** adjective
- **Root:** from telos, "end, goal, completion"
- **Definition:** Complete (in various applications of labor, growth, mental and moral character)
- **KJV occurrences:** 12 total (19 in BLB count)
- **Primary translations:** "perfect" (6x), "of full age" (1x)
- **Key uses:**
  - James 1:25 -- "whoso looketh into the **perfect** (teleios) law of liberty" -- the moral law is characterized as "perfect"
  - Matthew 5:48 -- "Be ye therefore **perfect** (teleios), even as your Father which is in heaven is **perfect** (teleios)" -- God's standard of moral completeness
- **Significance:** The law is called "perfect" (teleios) because it is complete, lacking nothing. It is the full expression of God's moral will. The Hebrew equivalent in Psalm 19:7 is tamiym (H8549), meaning "complete, whole, entire, without blemish."

## 4. KEY DISTINCTION: MORAL LAW (nomos/entole) vs. CEREMONIAL ORDINANCES (dogma)

### [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: dogma (δόγμα) -- "Decree/Ordinance"
- **Transliteration:** dogma
- **Pronunciation:** dog-mah
- **Part of Speech:** neuter noun
- **Root:** from dokeo, "to think, seem"
- **Definition:** A law (civil, ceremonial or ecclesiastical); a decree, ordinance
- **KJV occurrences:** 5 total
- **Uses in the NT:**
  - Luke 2:1 -- "a **decree** (dogma) from Caesar Augustus" (civil decree)
  - Acts 16:4 -- "the **decrees** (dogma) that were ordained of the apostles" (ecclesiastical)
  - Acts 17:7 -- "the **decrees** (dogma) of Caesar" (civil)
  - Ephesians 2:15 -- "the law of commandments contained in **ordinances** (dogma)" -- ABOLISHED
  - Colossians 2:14 -- "the handwriting of **ordinances** (dogma) that was against us" -- NAILED TO CROSS
- **Critical significance:** The word used for what was abolished at the cross is **dogma** -- decrees/ordinances -- NOT nomos (law) or entole (commandment). Paul uses a specific, different Greek word for what was removed. The "handwriting of ordinances" (cheirographon tois dogmasin) refers to the record of debt/penalty and the ceremonial regulations, NOT the Ten Commandments.

### [G3037](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3037/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: lithos (λίθος) -- "Stone"
- **Transliteration:** lithos
- **Pronunciation:** lee-thos
- **Part of Speech:** masculine noun
- **Definition:** A stone (literally or figuratively)
- **KJV occurrences:** 53 total
- **Key use for this study:** 2 Corinthians 3:3,7 -- "not in tables of **stone** (lithos), but in fleshy tables of the heart" / "written and engraven in **stones** (lithos)"
- **Significance:** The transition described in 2 Corinthians 3 is not from law to no-law, but from law-on-stone to law-on-hearts (fulfilling Jeremiah 31:33). The medium changes; the content remains.

|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}    | nomos       | law                | the standard       |

**Critical observation:** When the NT speaks of what endures, it uses nomos and entole. When it speaks of what was abolished, it uses dogma. This lexical distinction is essential for understanding the "temporary" passages in section F of 02-verses.md.
