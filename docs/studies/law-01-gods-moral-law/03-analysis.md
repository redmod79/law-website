# Verse Analysis

## Study Question
What is God's moral law? What is its basis, nature, and scope? Investigate the Decalogue's unique origin (God's voice, God's finger, stone, inside the Ark), its attributes that mirror God's character (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal), and its universal/eternal scope.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### A. THE DECALOGUE'S UNIQUE ORIGIN

---

#### A1. Spoken by God's Own Voice

##### Exodus 20:1-2 (with context vv. 18-22)
**Context:** The Sinai theophany. God speaks the Ten Commandments directly to the assembled nation of Israel. The surrounding context (vv. 18-22) shows the people's reaction: they heard thunderings, saw lightnings, the mountain smoked, and they stood afar off. They asked Moses to be the intermediary for all subsequent communication (v. 19), but for the Ten Commandments, God Himself spoke.
**Direct statement:** "God spake all these words" (v. 1). God is the direct speaker of the Decalogue. Verse 22 confirms: "Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven."
**Key observations:** The text identifies God as the direct speaker with no human intermediary for these specific words. The people heard God's voice directly. After the Ten Commandments, the people requested that Moses serve as mediator (v. 19), establishing a different delivery mode for all subsequent legislation.
**Cross-references:** Deuteronomy 5:4 confirms "face to face" communication. Deuteronomy 5:22 adds "he added no more" -- God spoke exactly the Ten Commandments directly and stopped.

##### Deuteronomy 5:4-5, 22-27
**Context:** Moses recounts the Sinai experience to the next generation, approximately 40 years later. He distinguishes between God's direct speech (the Ten Commandments) and Moses' own mediating role.
**Direct statement:** "The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire" (v. 4). "These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly...with a great voice: and he added no more" (v. 22).
**Key observations:** The phrase "he added no more" (v. 22) is a textual marker distinguishing the Ten Commandments from all other legislation. God spoke the Decalogue directly and then ceased speaking directly to the assembly. All subsequent laws came through Moses as intermediary (v. 27). Verse 5 parenthetically notes Moses' mediating role for what followed, but the Ten Commandments preceded that mediation.
**Cross-references:** Exodus 20:1 (God spoke), Exodus 20:19 (people requested Moses as mediator afterward).

##### Deuteronomy 4:10-13, 33, 36
**Context:** Moses exhorts Israel to remember the unique experience at Horeb. He draws attention to the unprecedented nature of the event.
**Direct statement:** "He declared unto you his covenant, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone" (v. 13). "Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?" (v. 33). "Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee" (v. 36).
**Key observations:** The text identifies the Ten Commandments as "his covenant" (v. 13). Verse 33 presents this as an event without parallel. Verse 36 states the purpose: "that he might instruct thee." The delivery method (God's own voice from heaven) is presented as unique in human history.
**Cross-references:** Hebrews 12:18-19 confirms the people's terrified response to God's direct speech.

---

#### A2. Written by God's Own Finger

##### Exodus 31:18
**Context:** After God finishes giving Moses the various laws and instructions for the tabernacle (chapters 25-31), He gives Moses the two tablets.
**Direct statement:** "Two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God."
**Key observations:** Three identifying markers in one verse: (1) "tables of testimony" -- the tablets are called testimony/witness; (2) "tables of stone" -- the medium is stone; (3) "written with the finger of God" -- the author is God Himself, personally inscribing the text. The word "finger" (etsba, H676) represents God's direct personal action.
**Cross-references:** Deuteronomy 9:10 uses identical language. Exodus 8:15 uses the same phrase "finger of God" to describe God's direct miraculous intervention. Psalm 8:3 uses "fingers" for God's creative work in making the heavens.

##### Exodus 32:15-16
**Context:** Moses descends from Sinai with the tablets immediately before discovering the golden calf incident.
**Direct statement:** "The tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables."
**Key observations:** The text emphasizes three things: (1) the completeness of the writing (both sides); (2) the tablets themselves were "the work of God" -- God made the tablets; (3) "the writing was the writing of God" -- not Moses' writing, not angelic writing, but God's own writing. The verb "graven" (charuth, H2801) indicates permanent engraving, not ink that could fade.
**Cross-references:** Exodus 34:1 shows that even when the first set was broken, God commanded replacement tablets with the same words, indicating the permanence of the content even when the medium was destroyed.

##### Deuteronomy 9:9-11
**Context:** Moses recalls the 40 days on the mountain and the giving of the tablets.
**Direct statement:** "The LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount" (v. 10).
**Key observations:** This passage connects the spoken delivery (God's voice at the assembly) with the written delivery (God's finger on stone). The same words God spoke are the same words God wrote. The tablets are called both "tables of stone" and "tables of the covenant" (vv. 9, 11), linking the stone medium with the covenant identity.

---

#### A3. Written on Stone

##### Exodus 24:12
**Context:** God calls Moses up the mountain to receive the tablets.
**Direct statement:** "I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them."
**Key observations:** God states that He has already written ("which I have written") the law and commandments on stone. The purpose is teaching ("that thou mayest teach them"). The stone medium is specified by God Himself before the tablets are given.

##### Exodus 34:1, 4, 27-29
**Context:** After Moses broke the first tablets (Exodus 32:19), God commands replacement tablets.
**Direct statement:** "Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest" (v. 1). "He wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments" (v. 28).
**Key observations:** The replacement tablets contain the same content as the originals -- "the words that were in the first tables." The text calls these "the words of the covenant, the ten commandments" (v. 28). Verse 29 calls them "two tables of testimony." The content is identified as exactly ten commandments, the covenant words, and the testimony.
**Note on v. 27:** "Write thou these words" in v. 27 refers to the context of the preceding narrative (the terms of covenant renewal in vv. 10-26), while v. 28 specifies that what was written on the tablets was "the ten commandments." The pronoun "he" in v. 28 (Hebrew third person) refers to God, consistent with v. 1 where God says "I will write."

##### Deuteronomy 10:1-5
**Context:** Moses recounts the making of the replacement tablets and the ark to hold them.
**Direct statement:** "I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark" (v. 2). "He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments" (v. 4). "I...put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me" (v. 5).
**Key observations:** The phrase "according to the first writing" confirms identical content on both sets of tablets. The sequence is: God writes, Moses places in ark, the tablets remain there ("there they be"). This passage links the stone medium, the divine authorship, and the ark placement in a single narrative.

##### 2 Corinthians 3:3, 7
**Context:** Paul contrasts the old covenant ministry with the new covenant ministry.
**Direct statement:** "Not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart" (v. 3). "The ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious" (v. 7).
**Key observations:** Paul acknowledges the Decalogue was "written and engraven in stones" and calls this ministration "glorious." The contrast is between the *medium* (stone vs. heart) and the *ministration* (condemnation vs. Spirit), not between the law's existence and its abolition. Paul calls this the "ministration of death" not because the law itself is deadly but because the law on stone condemns sinful flesh (cf. Romans 7:10-13 where the law is still "holy, just, good" even though it brings death to the sinner). The "glory that was to be done away" (v. 7) refers to the glory on Moses' face (the fading radiance), not to the law itself -- v. 13 clarifies it was "the end of that which is abolished" referring to the fading glory.
**Both-sides note:** The Abolished position reads 2 Corinthians 3:7-14 as stating the Decalogue itself ("written and engraven in stones") is "done away" and "abolished." The Continues position reads it as stating the *ministration* (the old covenant administration/condemnation function) is what is "done away," while the law itself remains (since Paul calls it "holy, just, good, spiritual" in the same epistle, Romans 7:12,14). This passage is addressed in depth by later studies in the series. *(To be examined in depth in a later law-XX study on 2 Corinthians 3.)*

---

#### A4. Placed Inside the Ark of the Covenant

##### Exodus 25:16, 21
**Context:** God gives Moses instructions for building the ark of the covenant.
**Direct statement:** "Thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee" (v. 16). "In the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee" (v. 21).
**Key observations:** Before the tablets are even given, God designates the ark as their repository. The tablets are called "the testimony" -- they are a witness of God's covenant. The instructions are repeated in both v. 16 and v. 21, emphasizing the placement.

##### Exodus 40:20
**Context:** The erection of the tabernacle and placement of its furnishings.
**Direct statement:** "He took and put the testimony into the ark."
**Key observations:** This records the actual placement of the tablets inside the ark, fulfilling God's instruction from Exodus 25:16.

##### Deuteronomy 31:9, 24-26 (Contrast: Book of the Law placed BESIDE the Ark)
**Context:** Near the end of Moses' life, he completes writing "this law" (the book of the law -- the broader legislation) and gives instructions for its placement.
**Direct statement:** "Moses wrote this law" (v. 9). "Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book" (v. 24). "Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee" (v. 26).
**Key observations:** The book of the law is placed "in the side of" (mitstsad, [H6654](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6654/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, meaning beside/at the side of) the ark -- NOT inside it. This contrasts with the Ten Commandments which were placed INSIDE the ark (Deuteronomy 10:5; 1 Kings 8:9). Two different repositories for two different documents: the Decalogue inside, the broader law code beside. The book of the law is called "a witness against thee" (v. 26) -- it testifies against the people. The tablets inside the ark are called "the testimony" -- they are God's witness of His covenant.

##### 1 Kings 8:9
**Context:** Solomon's dedication of the temple. The ark is placed in the Most Holy Place.
**Direct statement:** "There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt."
**Key observations:** At the time of the temple dedication (approximately 480 years after Sinai), the ark contains ONLY the two stone tablets. Nothing else is inside. This confirms the exclusive placement of the Decalogue inside the ark and distinguishes it from the book of the law (which was beside the ark).

##### Hebrews 9:4
**Context:** The author of Hebrews describes the tabernacle furniture.
**Direct statement:** "The ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant."
**Key observations:** The NT confirms the tablets were in the ark and calls them "the tables of the covenant." Hebrews mentions additional items (manna pot, Aaron's rod), which were at some point placed near or in the ark (cf. Exodus 16:33-34; Numbers 17:10) but 1 Kings 8:9 states only the tablets remained inside by Solomon's time.

---

### B. THE DECALOGUE ITSELF

##### Exodus 20:3-17 / Deuteronomy 5:6-21
**Context:** The Ten Commandments as directly spoken by God to Israel.
**Direct statement:** Ten specific commands covering duties to God (1st-4th) and duties to fellow humans (5th-10th). These are: (1) no other gods, (2) no graven images, (3) not take God's name in vain, (4) remember the Sabbath, (5) honor father and mother, (6) not kill, (7) not commit adultery, (8) not steal, (9) not bear false witness, (10) not covet.
**Key observations:** The commandments address both external behavior (killing, stealing, adultery) and internal disposition (coveting -- the 10th commandment is entirely internal, addressing desire). This internal reach is why Paul says "the law is spiritual" (Romans 7:14) -- it reaches the heart, not merely actions. The 4th commandment grounds the Sabbath in creation (Exodus 20:11) -- "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth." The Deuteronomy 5:15 version adds a redemptive dimension ("remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt"). Both reasons coexist.

---

### C. ATTRIBUTES OF THE LAW THAT MIRROR GOD'S CHARACTER

---

#### C1. Holy

##### Romans 7:12
**Context:** Paul's discussion of the law's relationship to sin in Romans 7:7-14. After asking "Is the law sin?" and answering "God forbid," Paul explains that the law reveals sin, and concludes with the law's nature.
**Direct statement:** "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."
**Key observations:** Paul uses three attributes: holy (hagios, G40), just (dikaios, G1342), and good (agathos, G18). The word "holy" is the same word used for God's own holiness (Revelation 4:8; 1 Peter 1:15-16). Paul states this as a present-tense declaration ("the law IS holy"), not a past-tense description. The context (Romans 7:7) identifies which law: "the law had said, Thou shalt not covet" -- the 10th commandment. Paul is speaking of the Decalogue.

##### Leviticus 19:2
**Context:** God's instructions to Moses for the congregation of Israel.
**Direct statement:** "Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy."
**Key observations:** God commands holiness in His people because He Himself is holy. The law that defines holy behavior shares the attribute of its Author. The same word (qadosh, H6918) is used for both God's character and the standard He sets.

---

#### C2. Just / Righteous

##### Deuteronomy 32:4
**Context:** The Song of Moses, a poetic summary of God's character and dealings.
**Direct statement:** "He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he."
**Key observations:** God's character is described as "just and right." His ways are "judgment" (mishpat). The law, which Paul calls "just" (Romans 7:12), reflects the justice of its Author.

##### Psalm 119:137-138, 142, 144, 172
**Context:** The psalmist's extended meditation on God's law.
**Direct statement:** "Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments" (v. 137). "Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful" (v. 138). "Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth" (v. 142). "The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting" (v. 144). "All thy commandments are righteousness" (v. 172).
**Key observations:** The psalmist equates God's righteousness with the righteousness of His law. The law IS righteousness (v. 172). This righteousness is not temporary: it is "everlasting" (v. 144). The psalmist applies the attribute of God (righteous) directly to the law (righteous).

##### Nehemiah 9:13
**Context:** The Levites' prayer recounting Israel's history.
**Direct statement:** "Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments."
**Key observations:** The law given at Sinai is characterized as "right judgments, true laws, good statutes and commandments." These are positive moral attributes assigned to the Sinai legislation.

---

#### C3. Good

##### Romans 7:12, 16
**Context:** Same as C1 above.
**Direct statement:** "The commandment holy, and just, and good" (v. 12). "I consent unto the law that it is good" (v. 16).
**Key observations:** Paul twice affirms the law is "good." In v. 16, even when the law condemns him, Paul agrees ("consents") that the law is good. The problem is not the law but sin in the flesh (v. 13).

##### 1 Timothy 1:8
**Context:** Paul's charge to Timothy regarding the proper use of the law.
**Direct statement:** "We know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully."
**Key observations:** Paul affirms the law IS good (present tense). The qualifier "if a man use it lawfully" addresses the use, not the nature of the law. The law's goodness is taken as a known fact ("we know").

##### Psalm 119:39, 68
**Context:** The psalmist's meditation on God's law.
**Direct statement:** "Thy judgments are good" (v. 39). "Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes" (v. 68).
**Key observations:** Verse 68 directly connects God's goodness with His statutes: because God IS good and DOES good, His statutes are good.

---

#### C4. Spiritual

##### Romans 7:14
**Context:** Paul's discussion of the law and the flesh in Romans 7.
**Direct statement:** "We know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."
**Key observations:** Paul contrasts the "spiritual" (pneumatikos, G4152) nature of the law with the "carnal" (sarkikos, G4559) nature of fallen humanity. The law is spiritual because it comes from God who is Spirit (John 4:24), and because it addresses the inner person (the 10th commandment prohibits coveting, an internal state). Paul says "we know" -- this is presented as established, agreed-upon knowledge, not a new argument.

##### John 4:24
**Context:** Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan woman about worship.
**Direct statement:** "God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."
**Key observations:** God's nature is spirit. The law, which Paul calls "spiritual," reflects this nature. The law requires not merely external conformity but spiritual/internal alignment ("in spirit and in truth").

---

#### C5. Perfect

##### Psalm 19:7-11
**Context:** David's psalm praising God's revelation in nature (vv. 1-6) and in His law (vv. 7-11).
**Direct statement:** "The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether."
**Key observations:** Six terms for the law, each with an attribute and a function:
1. Law (torah) -- perfect -- converts the soul
2. Testimony (eduth) -- sure -- makes wise
3. Statutes (piqqud) -- right -- rejoices the heart
4. Commandment (mitsvah) -- pure -- enlightens the eyes
5. Fear (yirah) -- clean -- endures forever
6. Judgments (mishpat) -- true and righteous -- altogether

The word "perfect" (tamiym, H8549) means "complete, whole, without blemish." The same word is used for sacrificial animals that must be "without blemish" and for God Himself (Deuteronomy 32:4: "his work is perfect"). The phrase "enduring for ever" (v. 9) directly states the eternality of this law.

##### James 1:25
**Context:** James exhorts believers to be doers of the word, not merely hearers.
**Direct statement:** "Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed."
**Key observations:** James calls the law "the perfect law of liberty" (nomos teleios tes eleutherias). The law is both "perfect" (complete) and associated with "liberty" (freedom). This is a NT writer affirming the perfection of the law and identifying it as a standard for ongoing Christian life ("continueth therein...a doer of the work"). James 2:10-12 clarifies which law by citing the 6th and 7th commandments of the Decalogue.

##### Psalm 119:96
**Context:** The psalmist contrasts human limitations with the law's scope.
**Direct statement:** "I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad."
**Key observations:** All human achievement has limits ("an end of all perfection"), but God's commandment is "exceeding broad" -- unlimited in scope. The law transcends all human standards.

---

#### C6. Eternal

##### Psalm 111:7-10
**Context:** A psalm praising God's works and faithfulness.
**Direct statement:** "All his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness" (vv. 7-8). "He hath commanded his covenant for ever" (v. 9).
**Key observations:** The commandments "stand fast for ever and ever" (ad, [H5703](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5703/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} + olam, H5769). This is the strongest Hebrew expression for perpetuity. The covenant is "for ever." The commandments are "sure" (amen -- reliable, faithful, established).

##### Psalm 119:89, 152, 160
**Context:** The psalmist's meditation on the permanence of God's word/law.
**Direct statement:** "For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven" (v. 89). "Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever" (v. 152). "Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever" (v. 160).
**Key observations:** Three separate declarations of the law's eternality:
1. "Settled in heaven" (v. 89) -- established in the divine realm, beyond earthly change
2. "Founded them for ever" (v. 152) -- the foundation is permanent
3. "Endureth for ever" (v. 160) -- every individual righteous judgment is perpetual

##### Psalm 119:44, 111, 142, 144
**Context:** Additional declarations of perpetuity.
**Direct statement:** "So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever" (v. 44). "Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever" (v. 111). "Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth" (v. 142). "The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting" (v. 144).
**Key observations:** The psalmist commits to perpetual obedience (v. 44), takes the testimonies as a permanent inheritance (v. 111), and declares both the righteousness and the law itself to be everlasting (vv. 142, 144).

##### Isaiah 40:8
**Context:** Isaiah's prophecy of comfort, contrasting human transience with God's permanence.
**Direct statement:** "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever."
**Key observations:** Everything in creation is transient; God's word alone is permanent. "Shall stand for ever" (qum le-olam) -- it rises, endures, remains established into perpetuity.

##### Matthew 5:17-18
**Context:** The Sermon on the Mount. Jesus addresses His relationship to the law and prophets.
**Direct statement:** "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."
**Key observations:** Jesus states His purpose regarding the law is not destruction (kataluo, to demolish, overthrow) but fulfillment (pleroo, to fill full, complete). The time frame for the law's validity is "till heaven and earth pass" -- the duration of the present creation. "One jot or one tittle" -- the smallest Hebrew letter (yod) and the smallest distinguishing mark on a letter -- nothing will pass away. This is Jesus' own statement about the permanence of the law.
**Both-sides note:** The Abolished position reads "fulfil" as meaning "complete and therefore terminate" (the purpose having been achieved, the law is superseded). The Continues position reads "fulfil" as "fill to the full" (give the complete intended meaning, as Jesus does in Matthew 5:21-48 by expanding the commandments). *(To be examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Matthew 5:17-19.)*

##### Luke 16:17
**Context:** Jesus' teaching about the law and the prophets.
**Direct statement:** "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."
**Key observations:** Jesus states it is easier for the entire physical creation to cease to exist than for one small detail of the law to "fail" (pipto, to fall). This is a hyperbolic comparison emphasizing the law's absolute permanence, using the same "heaven and earth" comparison as Matthew 5:18.

---

### D. THE LAW'S UNIVERSAL AND ETERNAL SCOPE

---

#### D1. Pre-Sinai Evidence

##### Genesis 26:5
**Context:** God reaffirms the Abrahamic covenant to Isaac, citing Abraham's obedience.
**Direct statement:** "Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
**Key observations:** Four terms for law are applied to Abraham, who lived centuries before Sinai: "charge" (mishmereth, H4931), "commandments" (mitsvah, H4687), "statutes" (chuqqah, H2708), and "laws" (torah, H8451). These are the same Hebrew terms used for the Sinai legislation. Abraham "kept" (shamar, to guard, observe) these laws. The text states this as the reason for God's covenant blessing -- Abraham's law-keeping preceded the formal Sinai promulgation by centuries.

##### Genesis 4:7-10
**Context:** God speaks to Cain before and after the murder of Abel.
**Direct statement:** "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door" (v. 7). "What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground" (v. 10).
**Key observations:** The concept of sin exists before Sinai. God holds Cain accountable for murder -- a violation of the 6th commandment -- though the Decalogue has not yet been formally given. The moral standard (do not murder) is treated as already operative. God describes Cain's failing as "sin" (chattath, H2403).

##### Genesis 39:7-9
**Context:** Joseph, enslaved in Egypt, resists his master's wife.
**Direct statement:** "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
**Key observations:** Joseph calls adultery "sin against God" -- a violation of what would later be the 7th commandment. This is centuries before Sinai. Joseph's moral awareness reflects a law already known and operative. He identifies the offense not as merely social but as "against God."

##### Romans 5:12-14
**Context:** Paul's theological argument about sin's universality through Adam.
**Direct statement:** "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses."
**Key observations:** Paul's argument requires a law existing before Moses. If "sin is not imputed when there is no law" but "death reigned from Adam to Moses," then some form of law existed in the pre-Sinai period. The text says death reigned "even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression" -- they violated a law, though not the same specific command Adam violated. Paul uses this to establish the universality of sin and the universality of law.

---

#### D2. Universal Application

##### Romans 2:14-16
**Context:** Paul's argument about God's impartial judgment of Jews and Gentiles.
**Direct statement:** "When the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness."
**Key observations:** Gentiles, who never received the Sinai legislation, nonetheless have "the work of the law written in their hearts." Their conscience accuses or excuses based on this internal law. This demonstrates the moral law is not limited to Israel but is universal, written on the human conscience. The phrase "the things contained in the law" (ta tou nomou) refers to the moral content of the law -- the same moral principles that the Decalogue codifies.

---

#### D3. Sin Defined by the Law

##### 1 John 3:4
**Context:** John's discourse on sin and righteousness.
**Direct statement:** "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law."
**Key observations:** This is a definitional statement. Sin IS the transgression of the law (anomia -- lawlessness). If the law were abolished, the very definition of sin would collapse. Sin is defined in relation to the law; remove the law, and sin has no definition. This statement is universal ("whosoever") and uses the present tense.

##### Romans 3:19-20, 23, 31
**Context:** Paul's conclusion to his argument about universal sinfulness.
**Direct statement:** "By the law is the knowledge of sin" (v. 20). "All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (v. 23). "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law" (v. 31).
**Key observations:** The law gives the "knowledge of sin" (v. 20). "All have sinned" (v. 23) presupposes a universal standard against which "all" have fallen short. Faith does not make the law void (katargeo, to render inoperative); instead, faith "establishes" (histemi, to cause to stand, to make firm) the law (v. 31). Paul emphatically denies ("God forbid") that faith eliminates the law.

##### Romans 7:7
**Context:** Paul's personal testimony about the law and sin.
**Direct statement:** "I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet."
**Key observations:** Paul identifies the specific law that revealed sin: "Thou shalt not covet" -- the 10th commandment of the Decalogue. This demonstrates that when Paul says "the law" reveals sin, he means specifically the Ten Commandments.

---

#### D4. Law as Standard of Judgment

##### James 2:8-12
**Context:** James' discussion of partiality and the law.
**Direct statement:** "If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well" (v. 8). "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all" (v. 10). "He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill" (v. 11). "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty" (v. 12).
**Key observations:** James calls the law "the royal law" (v. 8) and "the law of liberty" (v. 12). He identifies specific commandments of the Decalogue: "Do not commit adultery" (7th) and "Do not kill" (6th). The law functions as a standard of future judgment ("shall be judged by"). The unity of the law is emphasized: offending in "one point" makes one "guilty of all" (v. 10). This is a NT writer treating the Decalogue as a present, operative standard for believers, functioning as the judgment criterion.

##### Ecclesiastes 12:13-14
**Context:** The conclusion of the book of Ecclesiastes.
**Direct statement:** "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment."
**Key observations:** The "conclusion of the whole matter" -- the summary of all of life's wisdom -- is to "fear God and keep his commandments." This is described as "the whole duty of man" -- not just Israel, but "man" (adam). The scope is universal. Commandment-keeping is linked to judgment: "God shall bring every work into judgment."

---

#### D5. The Law Summarized in Love

##### Romans 13:8-10
**Context:** Paul's instruction on Christian conduct and civic responsibility.
**Direct statement:** "He that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."
**Key observations:** Paul quotes the 7th, 6th, 8th, 9th, and 10th commandments of the Decalogue by name, then states they are all "comprehended" (summarized) in the love command. Love "fulfills" (fills full) the law. The law is not replaced by love; love is the fulfillment of the law's requirements. The commandments are treated as specific, operative, identifiable content that love satisfies.

##### 1 John 5:2-3
**Context:** John's teaching on love and obedience.
**Direct statement:** "By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous."
**Key observations:** Love for God IS keeping His commandments. The two are equated, not set in opposition. The commandments are "not grievous" (barus, not heavy or burdensome). John writes this as a present reality for believers.

##### 1 Timothy 1:5, 8-10
**Context:** Paul's charge to Timothy about the purpose of the law.
**Direct statement:** "The end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart" (v. 5). "The law is good, if a man use it lawfully" (v. 8). The law is "for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners" (v. 9), then lists sins that correspond to the Ten Commandments: "murderers" (6th), "whoremongers" and "them that defile themselves with mankind" (7th), "menstealers" (8th), "liars" and "perjured persons" (9th).
**Key observations:** The "end" (telos, goal/purpose) of the commandment is love. The law's violations map directly onto the Decalogue. Paul affirms the law is good and identifies its ongoing function in defining sin. The sins listed in vv. 9-10 correspond to specific commandments.

---

### E. THE LAW IN THE NEW COVENANT

---

#### E1. New Covenant Promise

##### Jeremiah 31:31-34
**Context:** Jeremiah's prophecy of the new covenant.
**Direct statement:** "I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel" (v. 31). "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts" (v. 33).
**Key observations:** The new covenant does not introduce a new law; it provides a new location for the same law. "My law" (torati -- "my torah") is the same law, now written on hearts instead of stone. The covenant is "new" (chadash) -- not the law. The contrast is between the covenant arrangement (how the law relates to the people) and the law itself (which is transferred from stone to heart).

##### Hebrews 8:8-13
**Context:** The author of Hebrews quotes Jeremiah 31 at length.
**Direct statement:** "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (v. 10). "In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away" (v. 13).
**Key observations:** The new covenant writes "my laws" on hearts and minds. What is "vanishing away" is the first/old covenant ARRANGEMENT -- not the law itself (which is being internalized, not removed). The author quotes Jeremiah 31:33 to demonstrate that the new covenant involves the same law in a new location.
**Both-sides note:** The Abolished position reads "that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away" (v. 13) as referring to the entire old covenant system including the Decalogue. The Continues position reads the "vanishing" as referring to the covenant arrangement (the old way of administering the law externally on stone), not the law content itself (which the same passage says is written on hearts). *(To be examined in depth in a later law-XX study on the covenants.)*

##### Hebrews 10:15-17
**Context:** The author of Hebrews presents the Holy Spirit's witness.
**Direct statement:** "I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them."
**Key observations:** A third quotation of the Jeremiah 31 promise. The Holy Spirit is identified as the witness to this covenant. The laws are written on hearts and minds -- internalized, not eliminated.

##### Ezekiel 36:26-27
**Context:** God's promise of a new heart and spirit.
**Direct statement:** "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you...And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them."
**Key observations:** God promises to (1) give a new heart, (2) put His Spirit within, and (3) through that Spirit "cause you to walk in my statutes (chuqqah) and keep my judgments (mishpat)." The Spirit enables obedience to the SAME statutes and judgments. The content of obedience does not change; the power source does (human effort replaced by divine Spirit).

---

#### E2. Christ and the Law

##### Romans 3:31
**Context:** Paul's conclusion after discussing justification by faith.
**Direct statement:** "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."
**Key observations:** Paul emphatically denies that faith voids the law. "Make void" (katargeo) means to render inactive or abolish. "Establish" (histemi) means to cause to stand, to confirm. Faith CONFIRMS the law rather than abolishing it. The "God forbid" (me genoito) is Paul's strongest form of denial.

##### Romans 8:3-4, 7
**Context:** Paul's discussion of life in the Spirit vs. life in the flesh.
**Direct statement:** "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (v. 4). "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be" (v. 7).
**Key observations:** The purpose of Christ's incarnation and atoning death includes the fulfillment of the law's righteousness IN believers (v. 4). Walking by the Spirit enables what the flesh could not accomplish: meeting the law's standard. The "carnal mind" is characterized by its refusal to submit to "the law of God" (v. 7). If the law were abolished, enmity against it would be irrelevant. Paul treats submission to God's law as the defining characteristic of a Spirit-led mind.

---

#### E3. Commandment-Keeping in End-Time

##### Revelation 12:17
**Context:** The war between the dragon (Satan) and the remnant of the woman's seed (God's people).
**Direct statement:** "The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."
**Key observations:** God's end-time people are identified by two characteristics: (1) keeping the commandments (entole, G1785) of God, and (2) having the testimony of Jesus. The dragon's wrath is directed specifically against commandment-keepers. This is a future/eschatological description.
**Genre note:** Revelation is apocalyptic literature. The identification of "commandments of God" uses the standard NT term (entole) for moral commandments, the same word used in Romans 7:8-12 for the Decalogue. The passage passes the genre gate because it is a narrative description of identifiable characteristics, not symbolic imagery requiring interpretive decoding.

##### Revelation 14:12
**Context:** The third angel's message, describing the saints during the final crisis.
**Direct statement:** "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
**Key observations:** The saints in the end-time are identified by (1) keeping the commandments (entole) of God, and (2) the faith of Jesus. This parallels Revelation 12:17 with slightly different wording. Commandment-keeping and faith in Jesus are presented as complementary, not contradictory.

##### Revelation 22:14
**Context:** Near the close of the canon, in the final chapter of Revelation.
**Direct statement:** "Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city."
**Key observations:** A blessing is pronounced on those who "do his commandments" (entole). The reward is access to the tree of life and entrance to the city. This is one of the last statements in the Bible, and it affirms commandment-keeping as the identifying characteristic of those who enter eternal life.

---

### F. "TEMPORARY" CLASSIFICATION PASSAGES

These passages are listed under the "TEMPORARY" heading in Nave's Topical Bible and are cited by the Abolished position. They require careful analysis to determine what the text says is "temporary."

---

##### Romans 7:1-6
**Context:** Paul's analogy of marriage law to illustrate the believer's relationship to the law.
**Direct statement:** "Ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ" (v. 4). "We are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held" (v. 6).
**Key observations:** Paul says believers are "dead to the law" and "delivered from the law." The context of the chapter clarifies: immediately following this passage (vv. 7-14), Paul asks "Is the law sin?" and answers "God forbid," then declares the law is "holy, just, good, spiritual." Paul's analogy uses marriage law -- the death frees from the old obligation to sin (the "old man"), not from the law's moral content. Verse 6 clarifies the result: "that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter." The change is from letter-based (external) obedience to Spirit-based (internal) obedience.
**Both-sides note:** The Abolished position reads "dead to the law" as meaning the law itself no longer applies to believers. The Continues position reads it as meaning believers died to the law's condemning power (its penalty function) through Christ's death, not to its moral authority (which Paul affirms in vv. 12, 14). *(To be examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Romans 7.)*

##### Romans 8:3
**Context:** Already analyzed in E2 above.
**Direct statement:** "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh..."
**Key observations:** The law's limitation is not in itself but "through the flesh" -- the weakness is in sinful humanity, not in the law. God sent His Son to accomplish what the law could not accomplish through fallen human nature. The law's standard (dikaioma, righteous requirement) is then fulfilled in Spirit-led believers (v. 4).

##### Romans 10:4
**Context:** Paul's discussion of Israel's pursuit of righteousness.
**Direct statement:** "For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."
**Key observations:** The word "end" (telos, G5056) can mean either "termination" or "goal/purpose." The Greek allows both readings. If "termination," Christ ended the law; if "goal," Christ is the objective at which the law aimed. The context (vv. 1-3) discusses Israel seeking righteousness through law-keeping rather than through faith. Paul may be saying Christ is the goal of the law's pursuit of righteousness, not its termination. *(To be examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Romans 10:4.)*

##### 2 Corinthians 3:6-14
**Context:** Already analyzed in A3 above (2 Corinthians 3:3, 7). Paul contrasts the ministration of the old covenant with the new.
**Direct statement:** "The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life" (v. 6). "The ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious" (v. 7). "That which is done away was glorious" (v. 11). "The end of that which is abolished" (v. 13).
**Key observations:** Paul uses "ministration of death" (v. 7) and "ministration of condemnation" (v. 9) for the old covenant function of the law-on-stone. The contrast is between ministrations, not between law and no-law. What was "done away" (katargeo) is the ministration/glory, not the moral content. In the immediate context, v. 13 says "the end of that which is abolished" -- "that which is abolished" refers to the fading glory (doxa) on Moses' face. *(To be examined in depth in a later law-XX study on 2 Corinthians 3.)*

##### Galatians 3:19, 24-25
**Context:** Paul's argument about the relationship of law and promise in Galatians.
**Direct statement:** "Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come" (v. 19). "The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ" (v. 24). "After that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster" (v. 25).
**Key observations:** The law was "added" (prostithemi) because of transgressions. The phrase "till the seed should come" indicates a temporal function. The "schoolmaster" (paidagogos) was a guardian-tutor whose role ended when the student matured. "No longer under a schoolmaster" indicates a change in the believer's relationship to the law, not necessarily the law's abolition.
**Both-sides note:** The Abolished position reads this as the law's purpose being completed in Christ, making it no longer applicable. The Continues position reads "added" as referring to the ceremonial/sacrificial system added to address transgression, or as referring to the law's condemning/tutoring function (not its moral content) ending when faith comes. The referent of "the law" in Galatians is a key interpretive question. *(To be examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Galatians 3.)*

##### Ephesians 2:14-16
**Context:** Paul discusses the reconciliation of Jews and Gentiles in Christ.
**Direct statement:** "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances" (v. 15).
**Key observations:** The Greek reads "ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin" -- "the law of the commandments in ordinances/decrees." The key word is dogma (G1378), which is used for decrees/ordinances, not for the moral commandments (entole) themselves. The word study (04-word-studies.md) shows dogma is NEVER used in the NT for the moral law/Decalogue. The "law of commandments contained in ordinances" refers to the ceremonial regulations that created the "wall of partition" between Jews and Gentiles.
**Both-sides note:** The Abolished position may read this as abolishing the entire law system. The Continues position reads the phrase "in ordinances" (en dogmasin) as specifying WHICH aspect of the law was abolished: the ordinance/decree layer (ceremonial), not the moral commandments.

##### Colossians 2:14-17, 20-22
**Context:** Paul addresses false teachers at Colossae who are imposing regulations.
**Direct statement:** "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross" (v. 14). "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come" (vv. 16-17).
**Key observations:** The "handwriting of ordinances" (cheirographon tois dogmasin) uses dogma (G1378) -- decrees/ordinances -- not nomos or entole. What was "nailed to the cross" was the "handwriting of ordinances" (the record of debt in decrees/regulations). The items in v. 16 (meat, drink, holy day, new moon, sabbath days) are identified as "a shadow of things to come." The question is whether "sabbath days" here refers to the weekly Sabbath (4th commandment) or to the annual ceremonial sabbaths (Leviticus 23).
**Both-sides note:** The Abolished position reads this as including the weekly Sabbath among the shadows nailed to the cross. The Continues position reads "sabbath days" in the context of the list (meat, drink, holy day, new moon) as referring to the annual ceremonial sabbaths associated with the Jewish festival calendar (which included their own "sabbaths" -- Leviticus 23:24, 32, 39), not the weekly seventh-day Sabbath of the Decalogue. *(To be examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Colossians 2:14-17.)*

##### Hebrews 10:1
**Context:** The author of Hebrews discusses the old covenant sacrificial system.
**Direct statement:** "For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect."
**Key observations:** The "shadow" here is explicitly connected to "those sacrifices which they offered year by year" -- the annual sacrificial system. The "law" that is a shadow is the sacrificial/ceremonial law, not the Decalogue. The context (Hebrews 9-10) is entirely about the priestly and sacrificial system.

---

### G. ADDITIONAL KEY PASSAGES

---

##### Isaiah 42:21
**Context:** A Messianic prophecy in Isaiah's servant songs.
**Direct statement:** "The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable."
**Key observations:** The Messiah's work includes magnifying (gadal, to make great, enlarge) the law and making it honorable. This is the opposite of abolishing it. Magnification means expanding, deepening, and elevating the law -- consistent with Jesus' treatment in Matthew 5:21-48 where He expands the commandments to their full spiritual depth.

##### Matthew 19:16-19
**Context:** A rich young man asks Jesus about eternal life.
**Direct statement:** "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments" (v. 17). Jesus then lists specific Decalogue commandments: "Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother" (vv. 18-19).
**Key observations:** Jesus directs the inquirer to the commandments as the standard for life. He cites the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 5th commandments of the Decalogue by name. Jesus treats the Decalogue as a present, operative standard.

##### Matthew 22:36-40
**Context:** A lawyer tests Jesus with a question about the greatest commandment.
**Direct statement:** "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."
**Key observations:** Jesus summarizes the law in two love commands (Deuteronomy 6:5; Leviticus 19:18). The Ten Commandments divide into these two categories: love to God (1st-4th) and love to neighbor (5th-10th). "All the law and the prophets hang" on these -- the love commands are the foundation, and the specific commandments are the outworking. Jesus does not replace the law with love; He identifies love as the principle from which the law "hangs."

##### Hosea 8:12
**Context:** God's indictment of Israel through the prophet Hosea.
**Direct statement:** "I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing."
**Key observations:** God calls the law "MY law" and its contents "the great things." God Himself is the author ("I have written"). Israel counted these great things as "a strange thing" -- foreign, alien, unfamiliar. The indictment implies the law should have been familiar and treasured.

##### Nehemiah 9:13-14
**Context:** Already analyzed in C2 above.
**Key observations:** Provides a historical description of the Sinai event, calling the laws "right judgments, true laws, good statutes and commandments." Also mentions the holy Sabbath being made known (v. 14).

##### Ecclesiastes 12:13-14
**Context:** Already analyzed in D4 above.
**Key observations:** The "whole duty of man" is to "fear God and keep his commandments."

##### Proverbs 28:4-5, 7
**Context:** Solomon's wisdom sayings.
**Direct statement:** "They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them" (v. 4). "Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son" (v. 7).
**Key observations:** A binary contrast: those who forsake the law end up praising wickedness; those who keep the law resist wickedness. Keeping the law is associated with wisdom. Forsaking the law is associated with moral failure.

##### Matthew 5:19
**Context:** The Sermon on the Mount, immediately after Jesus' statement about the law not passing away.
**Direct statement:** "Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
**Key observations:** Jesus ranks kingdom citizens by their relationship to the commandments. Both doing and teaching commandments matter. Breaking even the "least" commandments has consequences. This follows directly from His statement about the law's permanence (vv. 17-18) and is introduced with "therefore" -- a logical conclusion.

---

### H. PSALM 119 -- THE LAW PSALM

**Context:** The longest chapter in the Bible, 176 verses, entirely devoted to praise of God's law. Every verse (with very few possible exceptions) references God's law using one of eight Hebrew terms: torah, mitsvah, mishpat, choq, eduth, dabar, piqqud, imrah.

**Key verse analysis:**

##### Psalm 119:1-2
**Direct statement:** "Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD. Blessed are they that keep his testimonies."
**Key observations:** The psalm opens with a beatitude: blessedness comes from walking in the law and keeping the testimonies. This is a present-tense blessing, not a past-tense historical note.

##### Psalm 119:11
**Direct statement:** "Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee."
**Key observations:** The law internalized in the heart prevents sin. This anticipates the new covenant promise (Jeremiah 31:33).

##### Psalm 119:44
**Direct statement:** "So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever."
**Key observations:** The psalmist commits to perpetual obedience ("for ever and ever" -- olam wa-ed).

##### Psalm 119:86
**Direct statement:** "All thy commandments are faithful."
**Key observations:** The commandments are faithful (emunah) -- reliable, trustworthy.

##### Psalm 119:89
**Direct statement:** "For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven."
**Key observations:** The law is "settled" (natsab, established, standing firm) in heaven itself. It is beyond earthly change or human revision.

##### Psalm 119:96
**Direct statement:** "I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad."
**Key observations:** All human achievements are limited. The commandment's scope is unlimited ("exceeding broad" -- meod rachab).

##### Psalm 119:126
**Direct statement:** "It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law."
**Key observations:** Making the law "void" (parar, to break, frustrate, annul) is viewed as a crisis requiring God's intervention. The psalmist treats any voiding of the law as a grievous offense.

##### Psalm 119:142
**Direct statement:** "Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth."
**Key observations:** The law IS truth (emeth). It shares the quality of truth with God Himself (John 14:6: "I am the truth").

##### Psalm 119:151-152
**Direct statement:** "Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth. Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever."
**Key observations:** The commandments are truth (v. 151). The testimonies are "founded...for ever" (v. 152) -- their foundation is eternal.

##### Psalm 119:160
**Direct statement:** "Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever."
**Key observations:** True from the beginning (rosh, the head, the first), enduring forever (olam). The scope is from beginning to eternity. Every individual judgment endures -- not just the whole, but each part.

##### Psalm 119:165
**Direct statement:** "Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them."
**Key observations:** Loving the law produces peace and stability. The law is associated with human flourishing, not bondage.

##### Psalm 119:172
**Direct statement:** "My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness."
**Key observations:** The commandments are equated with righteousness itself -- not merely righteous, but ARE righteousness.

---

## Patterns Identified

1. **Unique delivery mode:** The Decalogue alone was spoken by God's own voice (Exodus 20:1; Deuteronomy 5:4, 22), written by God's own finger (Exodus 31:18; Deuteronomy 9:10), engraved on stone (Exodus 32:15-16), and placed inside the ark (Exodus 25:16; Deuteronomy 10:5; 1 Kings 8:9). No other legislation in Scripture receives this treatment. Support: Exodus 20:1, 19-22; 24:12; 25:16, 21; 31:18; 32:15-16; 34:1, 28-29; 40:20; Deuteronomy 4:10-13, 33, 36; 5:4-5, 22-27; 9:9-11; 10:1-5; 1 Kings 8:9; Hebrews 9:4.

2. **Contrast with the book of the law:** The broader legislation ("this law") was written by Moses (Deuteronomy 31:9, 24), placed in a book (Deuteronomy 31:24), and put BESIDE the ark (Deuteronomy 31:26) -- not inside it. This physical separation mirrors a categorical distinction in the text. Support: Deuteronomy 31:9, 24-26; contrast 1 Kings 8:9.

3. **Attributes mirror God's character:** Every attribute applied to the law is also applied to God Himself: holy (Romans 7:12 / Leviticus 19:2), just (Romans 7:12 / Deuteronomy 32:4), good (Romans 7:12, 16 / Psalm 119:68), spiritual (Romans 7:14 / John 4:24), perfect (Psalm 19:7 / Matthew 5:48), eternal (Psalm 111:7-8 / Isaiah 57:15), true (Psalm 119:142 / John 14:6), pure (Psalm 19:8 / 1 John 3:3).

4. **Pre-Sinai existence:** The moral law's principles are demonstrably operative before Sinai: Abraham kept commandments, statutes, and laws (Genesis 26:5); Cain was held accountable for murder (Genesis 4:7-10); Joseph called adultery "sin against God" (Genesis 39:9); death reigned from Adam to Moses because of sin, which requires law (Romans 5:12-14).

5. **Universal scope:** The law extends beyond Israel: Gentiles have "the work of the law written in their hearts" (Romans 2:14-15); sin is universally defined by the law (1 John 3:4); "all have sinned" against this standard (Romans 3:23); keeping commandments is "the whole duty of man" (Ecclesiastes 12:13).

6. **New covenant internalization:** The new covenant does not abolish the law but writes it on hearts (Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:10; 10:16). The Spirit enables obedience to the same statutes (Ezekiel 36:27). Faith establishes the law (Romans 3:31).

7. **Eschatological continuity:** God's end-time people are identified as commandment-keepers (Revelation 12:17; 14:12; 22:14), using the standard NT word for moral commandments (entole, G1785).

8. **Greek vocabulary distinction:** When NT writers describe what was abolished, they use dogma (G1378) -- decrees/ordinances (Ephesians 2:15; Colossians 2:14). When they describe what continues, they use nomos (G3551) and entole (G1785). This lexical pattern is consistent across Paul's writings.

---

## Connections Between Passages

- **Romans 7:7 connects to Exodus 20:17:** Paul identifies the law that reveals sin as the 10th commandment of the Decalogue, confirming that his discussion of "the law" in Romans 7 refers to the Ten Commandments.
- **Romans 13:9 connects to Exodus 20:13-17:** Paul quotes five Decalogue commandments as the operative content of the law that love fulfills.
- **James 2:10-11 connects to Exodus 20:13-14:** James identifies the Decalogue commands ("Do not commit adultery...Do not kill") as the "law of liberty" by which believers will be judged.
- **Jeremiah 31:33 connects to Exodus 31:18 and Deuteronomy 10:1-5:** The law moves from stone tablets inside the ark to human hearts -- the same law, different location.
- **Ezekiel 36:27 connects to the Psalm 119 vocabulary:** The "statutes" (choq) and "judgments" (mishpat) God's Spirit enables believers to keep are the same terms used throughout Psalm 119 for God's law.
- **Revelation 12:17 and 14:12 connect to 1 John 5:3:** The end-time commandment-keepers reflect John's teaching that loving God means keeping His commandments.
- **Matthew 5:17-18 connects to Psalm 111:7-8 and Psalm 119:89, 160:** Jesus' affirmation of the law's permanence aligns with the Psalms' declarations that the commandments "stand fast for ever and ever" and are "settled in heaven."
- **Colossians 2:14 and Ephesians 2:15 connect through dogma (G1378):** Both "abolition" passages use the same Greek word for what was removed -- dogma (ordinances/decrees), not nomos or entole.

## Word Study Insights

1. **Torah (H8451)** means "instruction/direction" from the root "to throw, cast" (yarah). The law is God's direction, not arbitrary rules. The same word applies to Abraham's obedience (Genesis 26:5) and Jeremiah's new covenant promise (31:33), spanning the entire biblical timeline.

2. **Choq (H2706)** means "statute/decree" from the root "to cut in, inscribe" (chaqaq). The etymological connection to engraving/inscription parallels the physical engraving on stone, suggesting permanence.

3. **Nomos (G3551)** has multiple senses in the NT (moral law, Pentateuch, OT, principles). Context determines meaning. When Paul calls the law "holy, just, good, spiritual" (Romans 7:12, 14) and identifies it by the 10th commandment (Romans 7:7), he uses nomos for the Decalogue.

4. **Entole (G1785)** vs. **dogma (G1378):** The NT maintains a consistent vocabulary distinction. Entole is used for God's moral commandments that continue (Revelation 12:17; 14:12; 22:14; 1 John 5:3). Dogma is used for the ordinances/decrees that were abolished (Ephesians 2:15; Colossians 2:14). Dogma is never used for the moral law.

5. **Hagios (G40), pneumatikos (G4152):** The law is called "holy" and "spiritual" using the same terms applied to God Himself and to spiritual realities. These are not attributions that suggest temporality.

6. **Ad (H5703) and olam (H5769):** Used together in Psalm 111:8 ("for ever and ever") and Psalm 119:44 ("for ever and ever"), these represent the strongest Hebrew expression for perpetuity. Applied to God's commandments, they indicate permanence without terminus.

## Difficult Passages

### 2 Corinthians 3:7-14 -- "Ministration of Death...Done Away"
The text refers to the Decalogue specifically ("written and engraven in stones") and uses "done away" and "abolished" language. Both positions must address this passage. The Abolished position takes it as direct evidence the Decalogue was done away. The Continues position reads "ministration of death" as the condemnation function (not the law itself), and "that which is abolished" as the fading glory on Moses' face. The passage is addressed by a later study in the series.

### Romans 10:4 -- "Christ is the End of the Law"
The word telos can mean "termination" or "goal." Both readings are grammatically possible. If "termination," it supports the Abolished position. If "goal," it supports the Continues position (Christ is the aim of the law). Context must determine meaning. This passage is addressed by a later study in the series.

### Galatians 3:19, 24-25 -- "Added...Till the Seed Should Come" / "No Longer Under a Schoolmaster"
The temporal language ("till," "no longer under") suggests a changed relationship to the law. The question is what changed: the law itself, or the believer's relationship to its condemning/tutoring function? The referent of "the law" in Galatians is debated. This passage is addressed by a later study in the series.

### Colossians 2:16-17 -- "Sabbath Days...a Shadow"
Whether "sabbath days" here refers to the weekly Sabbath or annual ceremonial sabbaths is a key interpretive question. The surrounding context lists ceremonial items (meat, drink, holy day, new moon). This passage is addressed by a later study in the series.

### Hebrews 8:13 -- "Ready to Vanish Away"
What is "vanishing" -- the law itself or the old covenant arrangement? The same passage quotes Jeremiah 31:33 where the law is written on hearts (internalized, not removed). This passage is addressed by a later study in the series.
