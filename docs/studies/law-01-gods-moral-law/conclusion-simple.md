# God's Moral Law: What the Bible Says About the Ten Commandments

## A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence

---

### Introduction

Christians have long debated the status of God's law. Some believe the Ten Commandments remain binding as God's eternal moral standard. Others believe the entire Old Testament law was set aside at the cross. Still others hold positions somewhere in between.

This summary presents what the Bible itself says about the Ten Commandments -- their origin, their character, their scope, and their duration. It draws on passages from Genesis to Revelation, letting the biblical text speak to the question: **Is the moral law of God a permanent expression of His character, or was it a temporary arrangement that ended with the coming of Christ?**

## The Ten Commandments Were Given Unlike Any Other Law

One of the most striking features of the Bible's account is how differently God delivered the Ten Commandments compared to everything else He commanded. The Bible records at least seven ways in which the Decalogue stands apart from all other legislation.

**God spoke them with His own voice.** No other laws were delivered this way. The rest of the Mosaic legislation came through Moses as an intermediary, but the Ten Commandments came directly from God's mouth to the ears of the assembled people:

> "And God spake all these words, saying..." (Exodus 20:1)

> "The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire." (Deuteronomy 5:4)

> "These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me." (Deuteronomy 5:22)

That phrase -- "he added no more" -- is significant. After speaking these ten words, God stopped. Everything else was given through Moses.

**God wrote them with His own finger.** Moses wrote the rest of the law in a book, but the Ten Commandments were inscribed by God Himself:

> "And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God." (Exodus 31:18)

> "And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables." (Exodus 32:16)

**They were written on stone -- a permanent medium.** While the broader legislation was recorded on a scroll, the Ten Commandments were engraved in stone, a material associated with permanence and endurance.

**They were placed inside the ark of the covenant.** The book of the law was placed beside the ark, but the stone tablets went inside it -- in the most sacred space in all of Israel's worship:

> "There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb." (1 Kings 8:9)

In contrast, the book containing other laws was given a different location:

> "Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God." (Deuteronomy 31:26)

**They were called "the covenant" and "the testimony."** God Himself named them:

> "And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone." (Deuteronomy 4:13)

> "Two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God." (Exodus 31:18)

These distinctions are not drawn from outside the Bible. They are recorded in the Bible's own text. The Scripture itself treats the Ten Commandments as a category apart -- different speaker, different author, different medium, different storage location, different boundary, different naming. No other laws possess even one of these characteristics, much less all seven.

## The Bible Describes the Law the Same Way It Describes God

One of the most remarkable patterns in Scripture is that the attributes used to describe the law are the very same attributes used to describe God Himself. The Apostle Paul, writing to the Romans, declared:

> "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." (Romans 7:12)

> "For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin." (Romans 7:14)

Paul wrote these words in the present tense -- "the law IS holy," "the law IS spiritual" -- and he identified which law he was talking about by quoting the tenth commandment: "Thou shalt not covet" (Romans 7:7). When asked whether the law was sinful, Paul responded with his strongest possible denial: "God forbid."

The Psalms add further descriptions:

> "The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes." (Psalm 19:7-8)

> "All his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness." (Psalm 111:7-8)

> "For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven." (Psalm 119:89)

> "Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever." (Psalm 119:152)

> "Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth." (Psalm 119:142)

Holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, true, pure, righteous, eternal -- the Bible applies all of these words to both God and His law. If the law reflects the character of the Lawgiver, then to say the law is abolished is to imply something about God's character has changed. The Bible, however, presents a God who does not change and a law that mirrors who He is.

## The Law's Reach: Before Sinai, Beyond Israel, Into the Future

Some have argued that the Ten Commandments were a temporary arrangement given only to Israel at Mount Sinai. But the Bible's own evidence stretches the law's scope far wider than that -- in every direction.

**Before Mount Sinai.** Long before Moses received the stone tablets, the Bible records that God's moral principles were already known and operative:

> "Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws." (Genesis 26:5)

The moral law was already recognized in the earliest chapters of the Bible. God held Cain accountable for murder (Genesis 4:7-10). Joseph identified adultery as "sin against God" (Genesis 39:9). Paul argued that sin was present from Adam to Moses, which requires a law to define it:

> "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression...)" (Romans 5:12-14)

If no law existed before Sinai, sin could not have been charged to anyone's account. Yet death reigned -- proving the law was already in operation.

**Beyond Israel -- to all humanity.** Paul taught that even Gentiles who never received the written law still had access to its moral content through conscience:

> "For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another." (Romans 2:14-15)

The wise man summarized the scope of the commandments in universal terms:

> "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man." (Ecclesiastes 12:13)

**Into the New Covenant.** Rather than abolishing the law, the new covenant promises to internalize it:

> "But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people." (Jeremiah 31:33)

The book of Hebrews repeats this promise twice (Hebrews 8:10; 10:16). Ezekiel adds that God's Spirit would enable obedience to the same statutes:

> "And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them." (Ezekiel 36:27)

Notice that God does not promise a new or different law, but "my law" -- the same law He had already given. The change is not in the law itself but in where it is written: no longer on external stone tablets, but on the human heart through the Holy Spirit. Paul states plainly that faith does not cancel the law:

> "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." (Romans 3:31)

**To the end of time.** Jesus Himself declared:

> "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." (Matthew 5:17-18)

The final book of the Bible identifies God's faithful people by their relationship to the commandments:

> "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." (Revelation 14:12)

> "Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city." (Revelation 22:14)

## Three Independent Witnesses to the Moral Law

The Bible presents three independent channels through which the moral law is made known -- and this pattern itself is deeply significant.

**First, nature.** Paul wrote that God's character is visible through what He has made:

> "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse." (Romans 1:20)

The Psalms agree:

> "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world." (Psalm 19:1-4)

Paul told Gentile audiences that God "left not himself without witness" through the natural order (Acts 14:17). The result, Paul says, is that all people are "without excuse" -- morally accountable based on what nature reveals about God's character.

**Second, conscience.** As noted above, Paul taught that Gentiles have "the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness" (Romans 2:14-15). This is an internal moral faculty that operates independently of whether someone has ever read the Bible. It accuses or excuses -- holding people accountable to a standard they carry within them.

**Third, direct revelation -- the Ten Commandments themselves.** God spoke them with His own voice, wrote them with His own finger, engraved them on stone, and placed them in the most sacred location in Israel's worship.

Here is what makes this pattern significant: **all three channels converge on the same moral content.** All people, everywhere, can recognize through nature and conscience that murder, theft, adultery, and lying are wrong. But no one can learn from nature that a lamb must be sacrificed at Passover, or that the Day of Atonement falls on a particular date, or that a leper must present two birds and cedarwood for purification. No one can derive from conscience that tithes must be brought to the Levitical storehouse or that a Nazirite must abstain from grape products. Ceremonial and civil laws required specific revelation through Moses. They are not written in the stars or on the conscience.

This convergence supports the idea that the Bible itself distinguishes between moral law and other types of law -- not because theologians invented the categories, but because the text provides the evidence for the distinction. Moral law is attested by nature, conscience, and direct revelation. Ceremonial and civil law are attested only by specific revelation through Moses.

## What About the Passages That Speak of Abolishing the Law?

There are passages in the New Testament that use language of abolition, ending, or nailing to the cross. These passages are important and deserve honest treatment.

When we examine what the text actually says was abolished, a clear pattern emerges. The passages that identify their object use a specific Greek word -- translated "ordinances" or "decrees" -- for what was set aside:

> "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace." (Ephesians 2:15)

> "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross." (Colossians 2:14)

The word translated "ordinances" in these passages is a different Greek word than the ones used for the moral law elsewhere in the New Testament. When Paul discusses the moral law in Romans 7, he uses the standard words for "law" and "commandment." When Ephesians and Colossians describe what was abolished, they use a word that refers to decrees and ceremonial regulations. This word is never used for the moral law in the New Testament.

Hebrews specifies what was temporary in the sacrificial system:

> "For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect." (Hebrews 10:1)

The text specifically mentions "those sacrifices" -- not the moral law, but the ceremonial offerings that pointed forward to Christ's ultimate sacrifice. And even as Hebrews speaks of the old covenant arrangement passing away, the same passage declares that under the new covenant God will "put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them" (Hebrews 10:16). The covenant administration changes; the law itself is internalized rather than discarded.

There are also passages where the referent is genuinely ambiguous -- where "the law" is mentioned without specifying whether it means the moral law, the ceremonial system, or the law's condemning function. These include passages in Galatians 3, Romans 10:4, 2 Corinthians 3, and Colossians 2:16-17. Honest readers on both sides acknowledge that these passages require careful interpretation and do not settle the question by themselves.

What is notable is that no passage in the Bible uses cessation language that, upon examination, clearly and unambiguously refers to the Ten Commandments themselves. Every passage that clearly identifies what was ended points to the sacrificial and ceremonial system.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

Fairness requires acknowledging what the Bible does not explicitly state, no matter which side of the debate one holds.

**The Bible does not use the terms "moral law," "ceremonial law," or "civil law."** These are theological categories developed to describe patterns in Scripture. The text does provide evidence for the distinctions they describe -- seven markers separating the Ten Commandments from other legislation, and three channels of attestation that converge only on moral content -- but the labels themselves are not found in the Bible.

**The Bible does not explicitly state that "the entire law system was abolished at the cross."** That claim requires combining multiple passages and adding interpretive conclusions the text does not state on its own. The passages that clearly identify what was abolished point to ceremonial ordinances, not the Decalogue.

**The Bible does not explicitly resolve every disputed passage.** Whether "sabbath days" in Colossians 2:16 means the weekly Sabbath or the annual ceremonial sabbaths, whether "the end of the law" in Romans 10:4 means termination or goal, whether 2 Corinthians 3 declares the Decalogue itself abolished or only the old covenant administration -- these questions involve genuine interpretive choices that the text does not settle with a single plain statement.

**Neither side can claim that its complete systematic position is stated in any one verse.** Both the "law continues" position and the "law is abolished" position involve gathering evidence from many passages and drawing conclusions. The question is which conclusion requires fewer additions to what the text actually says and which conclusion must override or redefine more of what the text plainly states.

**The Bible does not say that all laws given at Sinai are identical in kind.** Some argue that since God gave all the laws, they must all be the same in nature and permanence. But the text itself draws seven distinct markers between the Ten Commandments and all other legislation -- different speaker, different writer, different medium, different storage location, different boundary, different naming, and different channels of attestation. The claim that all laws are undifferentiated must deny these distinctions that the Bible itself records.

**The Bible does not teach that salvation comes through law-keeping.** While affirming the law's continuing validity, Scripture is clear:

> "Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law." (Romans 3:28)

> "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast." (Ephesians 2:8-9)

The moral law reveals sin and provides God's standard for Christian living, but it does not provide salvation.

## Conclusion

The biblical evidence on this question is not evenly balanced. While there are passages that require further study and careful interpretation, the weight of the testimony falls heavily in one direction.

Every passage that directly describes the Ten Commandments uses language of permanence, holiness, and continuation. The law is called holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, and eternal. Jesus said He did not come to destroy it. Paul said faith establishes it. The new covenant promises to write it on hearts rather than abolish it. The final book of the Bible identifies God's faithful people as those who keep His commandments.

Meanwhile, every passage that clearly identifies what was abolished points to ceremonial ordinances -- not to the moral law. The passages that are ambiguous remain ambiguous, and no amount of emphasis on them can outweigh the clear, repeated, and explicit testimony of the passages that are plain.

The Ten Commandments were given in a way no other law was given -- by God's own voice, by God's own hand, on a permanent medium, in the most sacred place. They reflect God's own character. They were known before Sinai, recognized by Gentile conscience, and will identify God's people at the end of time. Three independent witnesses -- nature, conscience, and direct revelation -- converge on their moral content, while ceremonial and civil legislation is attested only by specific revelation through Moses.

The Bible presents the moral law of God not as a temporary regulation for one nation and one era, but as an eternal expression of the character of an unchanging God.
