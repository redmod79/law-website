# What Is God's Moral Law? Basis, Nature, and Scope

## Question
What is God's moral law? What is its basis, nature, and scope? Investigate the Decalogue's unique origin (God's voice, God's finger, stone, inside the Ark), its attributes that mirror God's character (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal), and its universal/eternal scope.

## Summary Answer
The Bible presents the Decalogue (Ten Commandments) as a distinct category of law, distinguished from all other legislation by seven unique markers: spoken by God's own voice, written by God's own finger, engraved on stone, placed inside the ark, completed with "he added no more," called "the covenant," and called "the testimony." The attributes the Bible ascribes to this law (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal) are the same attributes ascribed to God Himself. The law's scope extends before Sinai (Genesis 26:5; Romans 5:12-14), beyond Israel (Romans 2:14-15), into the new covenant (Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:10), and to the end of time (Revelation 12:17; 14:12; 22:14).

## Key Verses

**Exodus 20:1** -- "And God spake all these words, saying" (God is the direct speaker of the Decalogue)

**Deuteronomy 5:22** -- "These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me."

**Exodus 31:18** -- "Two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God."

**Romans 7:12** -- "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."

**Romans 7:14** -- "For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."

**Psalm 19:7** -- "The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul."

**Psalm 111:7-8** -- "All his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever."

**1 John 3:4** -- "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law."

**Romans 3:31** -- "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."

**Jeremiah 31:33** -- "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts."

**Revelation 14:12** -- "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."

God forbid: yea, we establish the law." | Rom 3:31 | Continues | V1: YES -- "establish the law" is law-continuation vocabulary. -> Candidate CONTINUES. Gate 1: The referent of "the law" (nomos). Paul uses nomos broadly in Romans 3, but his emphatic denial ("God forbid") + "establish" (histemi) indicates the moral law. Gate 1: PASS -- the context is Paul's sustained argument about justification and the law; the law that condemns (v. 19-20) is the same law established (v. 31). Gate 2: PASS -- declarative, with strongest denial formula. Gate 3: PASS -- didactic epistle. Gate 4: No conflict. PASS. -> CONTINUES. |
| E26 | "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." | Rom 8:4 | Continues | V1: YES -- "righteousness of the law...fulfilled in us." -> Candidate CONTINUES.

Gate 1: PASS -- "commandments of God" (entole tou theou). Gate 2: PASS.

| E37 | "The Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law...which shew the work of the law written in their hearts." | Rom 2:14-15 | Continues | V1: YES -- "the work of the law written in their hearts" implies ongoing moral law beyond Israel. -> Candidate CONTINUES.

On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." | Mat 22:37-40 | Neutral | V1: No explicit continuation/cessation vocabulary (this is a summary of the law's structure, not a statement about its duration). V2: No. -> Neutral. |

Paul calls the ministration glorious and says "which glory was to be done away" -- referring to the glory on Moses' face (v. 13), not to the law itself. V2: "done away" is cessation vocabulary, BUT the grammatical subject is "the glory of his countenance" (v. 7b), not the law. -> Neutral. (Factual observation: the Sinai ministration was glorious; the glory faded.) |
| E49 | "Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy." | Lev 19:2 | Neutral | V1: No law-specific continuation vocabulary. V2: No. -> Neutral. (This is a statement about God's character and the call to reflect it.) |

| E52 | "They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them." | Pro 28:4 | Continues | V1: YES -- "keep the law" as positive; forsaking the law linked to wickedness. -> Candidate CONTINUES. Gate 1: PASS -- "the law" in Proverbs = God's torah. Gate 2: PASS. Gate 3: PASS -- wisdom literature/didactic. Gate 4: No conflict. PASS. -> CONTINUES. |
| E53 | "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances." The Greek uses dogma (G1378) for "ordinances," not nomos or entole. | Eph 2:15 | Continues | V1: No moral-law continuation vocabulary. V2: "abolished" is cessation vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1 (Subject/Object): The grammatical object is "the law of commandments contained in ordinances" (ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin). The word dogma specifies the type: ordinances/decrees. The word study confirms dogma (G1378) is never used for the moral law/Decalogue in the NT. The referent is the ceremonial ordinances, not the Decalogue. GATE 1 ASSESSMENT: The referent is identified by the text's own vocabulary (dogma) as ceremonial ordinances. -> Step 3 (Reclassification): RC1 -- the referent is ceremonial ordinances (dogma), not the moral law. RC2 -- Corrected observation: "Paul states that ceremonial ordinances (dogma) were abolished." RC3 -- Re-enter V1: No moral-law continuation. V2: cessation applies to ceremonial ordinances. Both sides agree ceremonial ordinances ceased. -> Neutral. Reclassified: The use of dogma (not nomos/entole) for what was abolished evidences different NT vocabulary for different law types, supporting the Continues position's claim that the Bible distinguishes between moral and ceremonial law categories. The Abolished position denies any such distinction. -> Continues. |
| E54 | "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross." The Greek uses dogma (G1378) for "ordinances." | Col 2:14 | Continues | Same analysis as E53. The "handwriting of ordinances" (cheirographon tois dogmasin) uses dogma. GATE 1: Referent identified as dogma (ceremonial decrees). -> Step 3 reclassification: Both sides agree ceremonial decrees were nailed to the cross. -> Neutral. Reclassified: The use of dogma (not nomos/entole) for what was nailed to the cross evidences different NT vocabulary for different law types, supporting the Continues position's claim that the Bible distinguishes between moral and ceremonial law categories. The Abolished position denies any such distinction. -> Continues. |
| E55 | "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come." | Col 2:16-17 | Neutral | V2: "shadow" is cessation vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: The subject list is "meat, drink, holyday, new moon, sabbath days." The referent of "sabbath days" is ambiguous: it could refer to the weekly Sabbath (Decalogue) or the annual ceremonial sabbaths (Lev 23). The surrounding items (meat, drink, holyday, new moon) are all ceremonial. GATE 1 FAIL: Referent of "sabbath days" is ambiguous between weekly Sabbath and annual ceremonial sabbaths. -> Step 3: RC1 -- referent of "sabbath" is ambiguous. RC2 -- Corrected observation: "Paul lists ceremonial items (meat, drink, holy day, new moon) and 'sabbath days' as shadows; the referent of 'sabbath days' is unspecified between weekly and annual." RC3 -- Neither continuation nor cessation vocabulary applies unambiguously to the moral law. -> Neutral. *(To be examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Colossians 2:16-17.)* |
| E56 | "For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect." | Heb 10:1 | Neutral | V2: "shadow" is cessation vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: The subject is "those sacrifices which they offered year by year" -- explicitly the annual sacrificial system. The referent is ceremonial, not the Decalogue. -> Step 3: Corrected observation: "The annual sacrificial system is a shadow." Both sides agree. -> Neutral. |
| E57 | "In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away." | Heb 8:13 | Neutral | V2: "vanish away" is cessation vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: The subject of "decayeth and waxeth old" is "the first [covenant]" -- the old covenant arrangement. The same passage (v. 10) states the law is written on hearts in the new covenant. The referent of what "vanishes" is the old covenant system/administration, not the law itself (which is internalized). GATE 1 ASSESSMENT: The referent is the old covenant arrangement, not the moral law. -> Step 3: Corrected observation: "The old covenant arrangement is vanishing; the law is being written on hearts." -> Neutral (both sides agree the old covenant arrangement changed). |
| E58 | "Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made." | Gal 3:19 | Neutral | V2: "added...till" is temporal/cessation vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: "The law" (ho nomos). Which law was "added"? The moral law existed before Sinai (Gen 26:5; Rom 5:12-14). The word "added" (prostithemi) suggests something supplemental. The referent is ambiguous: it could be the entire Sinai legislation, the ceremonial system, or the law's condemning function. GATE 1 FAIL: Referent is ambiguous. -> Step 3: RC1 -- referent of "the law" is unspecified. RC2 -- "Paul states something was 'added because of transgressions, till the seed should come'; the specific referent is not identified as the Decalogue or the ceremonial system." RC3 -- Neither V1 nor V2 applies to a clearly identified law. -> Neutral. *(To be examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Galatians 3.)* |
| E59 | "The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster." | Gal 3:24-25 | Neutral | Same analysis as E58. The referent of "the law" is ambiguous (same Galatians 3 context). Gate 1 FAIL. -> Neutral. |
| E60 | "Ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ" and "we are delivered from the law." Yet in the same chapter (vv. 12, 14) Paul calls the law "holy, just, good, spiritual." | Rom 7:4, 6 | Neutral | V2: "dead to the law" and "delivered from the law" are cessation vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: "The law" (nomos). The same context (vv. 7-14) identifies this law as the Decalogue (v. 7: "Thou shalt not covet") and calls it holy, just, good, spiritual. The referent is identified, but the passage contains both cessation (vv. 4, 6) and continuation (vv. 12, 14) vocabulary for the same law. GATE 4 FAIL: Harmony conflict with E10 and E11 (same author, same chapter, says the law is holy, just, good, spiritual). -> Step 3: SIS resolution: vv. 12, 14 are declarative positive statements about the law's nature. vv. 4, 6 describe the believer's changed relationship to the law's condemning function. The clearer passage (declarative attributes of the law, vv. 12, 14) governs the reading of vv. 4, 6. -> RC2: "Believers are freed from the law's condemning power (dead to its penalty), but the law itself remains holy, just, good, and spiritual." RC3: Neither V1 nor V2 vocabulary applies cleanly after correction. -> Neutral. *(To be examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Romans 7.)* |
| E61 | "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth." The word "end" (telos, G5056) can mean "termination" or "goal." | Rom 10:4 | Neutral | V2: "end of the law" could be cessation vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 2 (Grammar): The word telos has a semantic range that includes both "termination" and "goal/purpose." The grammar alone does not determine which sense is intended. GATE 2 FAIL: semantic range allows alternative reading. -> Step 3: RC2 -- "Paul states Christ is the telos of the law for righteousness; telos can mean 'goal' or 'termination.'" RC3 -- Neither V1 nor V2 applies unambiguously. -> Neutral. *(To be examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Romans 10:4.)* |
| E62 | "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son..." | Rom 8:3 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. The statement is about the law's limitation (through the flesh), not about its cessation or continuation. -> Neutral. |
| E63 | "That which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse." Paul states God's attributes are knowable through the created order. Greek: gnoston (G1110, "knowable"), phaneron (G5318, "manifest"), anapologetous (G379, "without excuse"). | Rom 1:19-20 | Neutral | V1: No law-continuation vocabulary. V2: No cessation vocabulary. -> Neutral. (Factual observation: God has revealed His attributes through creation such that all humanity is without excuse.) |
| E64 | "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world." | Psa 19:1-4 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. -> Neutral. (Factual observation: creation communicates knowledge of God universally -- "through all the earth." This is in the same Psalm that transitions to the law in vv. 7-11.) |
| E65 | "He left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness." Paul states God gave witness (martyron, G3144) of Himself to all nations through nature. | Acts 14:17 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. -> Neutral. (Factual observation: God provided witness of Himself to all nations through the natural order.) |
| E66 | Paul states Gentiles' "conscience also bearing witness" (synmartyroushes...tes synedeseos) alongside the "work of the law written in their hearts." The conscience (syneidesis, G4893) functions as an internal witness that accuses or excuses -- a moral faculty operating independently of the written law. | Rom 2:15 | Neutral | V1: No explicit continuation/cessation vocabulary. V2: No. -> Neutral. (Factual observation: the conscience is presented as a distinct witness mechanism -- separate from the written law but attesting the same moral content.) |

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

Each N-item below has been processed through **Tree 1 (N-CHECK)**, **Tree 4 (Gate 0: three N-tier tests)**, then **Tree 3 (Vocabulary Scan + Four Validation Gates)**.

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Why Unavoidable | Tree 4 / Tree 3 Trace |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The Bible presents two different modes of delivery for the Decalogue and the broader legislation: God spoke the Ten Commandments directly (E1, E2); all subsequent laws came through Moses as human mediator (E9). | E1, E2, E9 | Continues | E1 states God spoke the Ten Commandments. E2 states "he added no more." E9 states Moses wrote "this law" in a book. Two different speakers, two different delivery modes. No reader can deny this from the cited statements. | Gate 0: N-Test 1 (Universal): YES -- both positions acknowledge this textual distinction. N-Test 2 (No interpretation): YES -- the only possible reading. N-Test 3 (Zero added concepts): YES. PASS. -> Tree 3: V1 No, V2 No -> Neutral. Reclassified: The delivery mode distinction (God's voice vs. human mediator) evidences a categorical distinction between law types. This supports the Continues position; the Abolished position denies any such distinction. -> Continues. |
| N2 | The Bible assigns the Decalogue and the book of the law two different physical repositories: the Decalogue INSIDE the ark (E7, E8); the book of the law BESIDE the ark (E9). | E7, E8, E9 | Continues | E7 says tablets placed inside the ark. E8 says only the tablets were inside. E9 says the book of the law was placed "in the side of" (beside) the ark. Two documents, two locations. No reader can deny this. | Gate 0: All three tests PASS. -> Tree 3: V1 No, V2 No -> Neutral. Reclassified: The repository distinction (inside the ark vs. beside it) evidences a categorical distinction between law types. This supports the Continues position; the Abolished position denies any such distinction. -> Continues. |
| N3 | The attributes the Bible ascribes to the law (holy: E10; just: E10; good: E10; spiritual: E11; perfect: E12; eternal: E14) are the same attributes ascribed to God Himself (holy: Lev 19:2/E49; just: Deu 32:4; good: Psa 119:68; Spirit: Jhn 4:24; perfect: Mat 5:48; eternal: Isa 57:15). | E10, E11, E12, E14, E49 | Continues | The same vocabulary (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal) is used for both God and His law. This is an observable lexical fact. Both positions can verify that the same words are used. | Gate 0: N-Test 1: YES -- both sides acknowledge the same vocabulary is used. N-Test 2: YES. N-Test 3: YES. PASS. -> Tree 3: V1 No, V2 No -> Neutral (factual vocabulary observation). Reclassified: The characterization distinction (moral law = holy/just/good/spiritual vs. ceremonial = carnal/temporary/weak) evidences a categorical distinction between law types. The moral law mirrors God's own attributes while other legislation does not receive these characterizations. This supports the Continues position; the Abolished position denies any such distinction. -> Continues. |
| N4 | Paul identifies the law he discusses in Romans 7 as the Decalogue by quoting the 10th commandment (E46: "Thou shalt not covet"), and then calls that law holy, just, good (E10), and spiritual (E11). | E46, E10, E11 | Neutral | E46 quotes the 10th commandment. E10 and E11 describe that same law. The identification is made by Paul himself in the text. No reader can deny that Paul quotes the 10th commandment and then attributes these qualities to that law. | Gate 0: All three tests PASS. -> Tree 3: V1 No, V2 No -> Neutral (factual identification). |
| N5 | The definition "sin is the transgression of the law" (E23) requires a continuing law for sin to remain definable. If the law were abolished, the definition would be vacated. | E23 | Continues | E23 defines sin as law-transgression. If law ceases, sin ceases to have this definition. This is a logical entailment of the definition. | Gate 0: N-Test 1: Would an Abolished scholar agree? A scholar who holds the law is abolished must either (a) accept a different definition of sin, or (b) accept a replacement law. Some Abolished scholars posit a "law of Christ" that replaces the Mosaic law. If so, they might argue E23 refers to that replacement law. N-Test 1: This requires choosing between referents. FAIL. -> Reclassify as I. -> Tree 2 (I-Type): Source: Text-derived (E23 is in the E table). Direction: Does the claim require E23 to mean something other than its lexical value? NO -- it is the direct logical entailment. -> I-A. -> Tree 5: IP1 YES (supports continuing moral law). -> I-A, Continues. |

**N5 reclassified as I-A. See Inferences table (I1).**

| N6 | The replacement tablets contain the same words as the originals: "I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables" (E4 context, Exo 34:1) and "according to the first writing, the ten commandments" (Deu 10:4). The content is identical across both sets. | E4 (Exo 32:15-16); Exo 34:1; Deu 10:4 | Neutral | The text explicitly states the replacement words are "the words that were in the first tables" and "according to the first writing." The content is stated to be identical. No reader can deny this. | Gate 0: All three tests PASS. -> Tree 3: V1 No, V2 No -> Neutral. |
| N7 | The Bible presents three independent channels through which the moral law is known: (1) nature/creation -- God's attributes are "clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made" (E63, Rom 1:19-20) and "the heavens declare the glory of God" (E64, Psa 19:1-4); (2) conscience -- Gentiles have "the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness" (E37, E66, Rom 2:14-15); (3) direct revelation -- the Decalogue spoken by God's voice and written by God's finger (E1-E4). All three attest moral content; none attest ceremonial or civil legislation. | E63, E64, E65, E37, E66, E1-E4 | Continues | E63 states God's attributes are knowable through creation. E64 states creation universally communicates God's glory. E65 states God left witness through nature. E37 states Gentiles do "the things contained in the law" by nature. E66 states conscience bears witness alongside the written-on-hearts law. E1-E4 state the Decalogue was spoken/written by God directly. These are three observable channels. No reader can deny these three channels exist in the text. The directional classification (Continues) follows because the existence of multiple independent witnesses to the moral law -- including witnesses that operate without Sinai revelation -- supports the claim that the moral law is distinct from ceremonial/civil law. Ceremonial law (sacrifice procedures, feast calendars, purity regulations) is not attested by nature or conscience; it requires specific revelation. This distinction supports the Continues position; the Abolished position denies any such distinction. | Gate 0: N-Test 1: YES -- both sides can observe these three channels in the text. N-Test 2: YES -- no interpretation required; the text presents all three. N-Test 3: YES -- no concept added; the observation is that these three channels exist and that nature/conscience do not attest ceremonial content. PASS. -> Tree 3: V1 No, V2 No -> Neutral. Reclassified: The existence of non-Sinaitic witnesses (nature, conscience) to the moral law -- but not to ceremonial/civil law -- evidences a categorical distinction between law types. This supports the Continues position; the Abolished position denies any such distinction. -> Continues. |
| N8 | Psalm 19 transitions from creation's testimony (vv. 1-6) to the law's attributes (vv. 7-11) within a single literary unit, presenting nature and the law as complementary witnesses to the same God. The heavens "declare" (saphar, narrate) God's glory (vv. 1-4); the law "converts" (shub) the soul (v. 7). | E64, E12, E13 | Neutral | E64 (Psa 19:1-4) describes creation's testimony. E12 (Psa 19:7) describes the law's perfection. E13 (Psa 19:8-9) describes the commandment's purity. These are in the same psalm, forming a single literary progression. No reader can deny this structural observation. | Gate 0: N-Test 1: YES -- the literary structure of Psalm 19 is observable by all. N-Test 2: YES. N-Test 3: YES -- no concept added beyond what the text presents. PASS. -> Tree 3: V1 No, V2 No -> Neutral. (Structural/literary observation both sides accept.) |

### 3. Inferences Table

Each I-item below has been processed through **Tree 2 (I-Type Classification)** and **Tree 5 (I-Item Positional Classification)**.

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that the moral law must continue in force for sin to remain definable. | I-A | E23 (1 John 3:4): "sin is the transgression of the law." E24 (Rom 3:20): "by the law is the knowledge of sin." E46 (Rom 7:7): "I had not known sin, but by the law." These texts define sin in relation to the law. | Systematizing E23, E24, and E46 into the broader claim that the law MUST continue for sin to be definable. Each text individually defines sin in relation to the law; the claim that this REQUIRES the law's continuation involves systematizing these into a doctrinal position. An Abolished scholar could argue a "new law" or "law of Christ" replaces the function. | #5 (systematizing multiple E-items) |
| I2 | The Bible teaches that the moral law (Decalogue) and the ceremonial law are two categorically distinct bodies of legislation. | I-A | E1-E4 (Decalogue: God's voice, God's finger, stone). E7-E8 (inside the ark). E9 (book of the law: Moses wrote, placed beside the ark). N1 (two different delivery modes). N2 (two different repositories). E53 (Eph 2:15: dogma abolished). E54 (Col 2:14: dogma nailed to cross). Word study: dogma (G1378) is never used for the moral law; entole (G1785) is used for moral commandments. | The Bible presents different delivery modes (N1), different repositories (N2), different Greek terms (dogma vs. entole), and different fates (dogma abolished; entole kept by saints). The claim that these constitute two CATEGORICALLY DISTINCT bodies of legislation systematizes these observations into a framework. While the data points are all from E/N, the concept of "categorical distinction" is a systematization. | #5 (systematizing) |
| I3 | The Bible teaches that the moral law existed before its formal promulgation at Sinai and is therefore not limited to the Mosaic era. | I-A | E34 (Gen 26:5): Abraham kept commandments, statutes, laws before Sinai. E35 (Gen 39:9): Joseph called adultery sin against God before Sinai. E36 (Rom 5:12-14): sin/death from Adam to Moses implies law. | Each E-item individually shows moral awareness or law vocabulary before Sinai. The claim that this means the moral law PRE-EXISTED Sinai and is NOT LIMITED to the Mosaic era systematizes these observations. | #5 (systematizing) |
| I4 | The Bible teaches that the moral law is universal, binding on all humans, not just Israel. | I-A | E37 (Rom 2:14-15): Gentiles have the work of the law written on their hearts. E23 (1 Jn 3:4): "Whosoever committeth sin" -- universal scope. E45 (Ecc 12:13): keeping commandments is "the whole duty of man." E36 (Rom 5:12): "death passed upon all men." | Each E-item references a universal scope. The claim that the moral law is UNIVERSAL and BINDING ON ALL HUMANS systematizes these into a doctrine. | #5 (systematizing) |
| I5 | The Bible teaches that the new covenant internalizes the same moral law rather than replacing it with a different law. | I-A | E38 (Jer 31:33): "I will put MY LAW (torati) in their inward parts." E39 (Heb 8:10; 10:16): "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts." E40 (Eze 36:27): "cause you to walk in MY STATUTES...keep MY JUDGMENTS." The possessive pronouns ("my law," "my statutes") indicate the same law God already gave. | The claim that the law is THE SAME law (not a replacement) is supported by the possessive pronouns and the Hebrew vocabulary (torah, choq, mishpat are the standard terms for God's existing law). However, systematizing "same possessives = same content" into the doctrinal claim "no new law, same old law" involves a step of reasoning. An Abolished scholar might argue "my law" in the new covenant context means a new "law of Christ." | #5 (systematizing); minor #4b (cross-referencing Jer 31:33 with the Sinai vocabulary) |
| I6 | The NT passages that use cessation vocabulary (abolished, nailed to cross, shadow, done away) refer to the ceremonial ordinances (dogma), not to the moral law (Decalogue). | I-B | FOR: E53 (Eph 2:15 uses dogma), E54 (Col 2:14 uses dogma), E56 (Heb 10:1 specifies "those sacrifices"), E10-E11 (same author Paul calls the law holy/spiritual). AGAINST: E55 (Col 2:16-17 lists "sabbath days" among shadows -- could include weekly Sabbath), E48 (2 Cor 3:7 says "written and engraven in stones" was "glorious...to be done away"), E58-E59 (Gal 3:19, 24-25: "the law" was schoolmaster, no longer under). | The claim assigns ALL cessation passages to the ceremonial system. However, some cessation passages (2 Cor 3:7; Gal 3:19, 24-25) use "the law" without specifying ceremonial vs. moral, and 2 Cor 3:7 explicitly references what was "written and engraven in stones" (the Decalogue). E/N items exist on both sides. | #2 (choosing between readings of which law is meant); #5 (systematizing) |
| I7 | The Bible teaches that the entire law system (moral, ceremonial, and civil) was abolished at the cross and replaced by the "law of Christ." | I-D | E53 (Eph 2:15): "abolished...the law of commandments contained in ordinances." E54 (Col 2:14): "handwriting of ordinances...nailed to his cross." E58 (Gal 3:19): "till the seed should come." E59 (Gal 3:24-25): "no longer under a schoolmaster." E57 (Heb 8:13): "ready to vanish away." AGAINST: E10-E11 (law is holy, just, good, spiritual -- present tense). E21-E22 (not one jot or tittle shall pass). E25 (faith establishes the law). E23 (sin is transgression of the law). E31-E33 (end-time saints keep commandments). E38-E40 (new covenant writes the same law on hearts). | This claim requires E53-E54 (which use dogma) to include the moral law, even though dogma is never used for the moral law. It requires "fulfilled" (E21) to mean "terminated." It requires "establish" (E25) to not mean what histemi lexically means. It requires the new covenant law on hearts (E38-E40) to be a different law than what was on stone. It overrides multiple E-items (E10, E11, E21, E22, E25, E38-E40) by redefining their plain meaning. | #1 (adding "all laws" to passages that specify dogma); #2 (choosing "termination" for telos/pleroo); #3 (applying a framework where all OT law = one undivided unit) |
| I8 | The threefold division of the law (moral, ceremonial, civil) is a valid hermeneutical framework for understanding which laws continue and which were abolished. | I-C | The Bible does not use the terms "moral law," "ceremonial law," or "civil law" as category labels. However, the data in E1-E9, N1-N2 show different delivery modes, different repositories, and different Greek terms (dogma vs. entole) for different types of laws. The framework is compatible with these observations but is not stated by the text. | The threefold classification is a theological framework imported from systematic theology. The text provides the raw data (different deliveries, different terms, different fates) but does not use the labels "moral," "ceremonial," or "civil." The framework is compatible with but not stated by the text. | #3 (external framework); #5 (systematizing) |
| I9 | The moral law is knowable independently of the Sinai revelation -- through nature (Rom 1:19-20; Psa 19:1-4; Acts 14:17) and conscience (Rom 2:14-15) -- which distinguishes it from ceremonial and civil law that required specific revelation. No one can discern sacrifice procedures, feast calendars, purity regulations, or civil restitution formulas from observing creation or consulting conscience. | I-A | E63 (Rom 1:19-20): God's attributes are "clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made." E64 (Psa 19:1-4): "The heavens declare the glory of God...their line is gone out through all the earth." E65 (Acts 14:17): God "left not himself without witness." E37 (Rom 2:14-15): Gentiles "do by nature the things contained in the law...the work of the law written in their hearts." E66 (Rom 2:15): conscience "bearing witness" and "accusing or else excusing." N7 (three independent channels attest moral content). The moral content (do not murder, do not steal, do not lie, etc.) is attested by all three channels. Ceremonial content (sacrifice a lamb on Passover, observe Day of Atonement, purify after contact with a corpse) is not attested by nature or conscience. | Systematizing E63, E64, E65, E37, E66, and N7 into the broader claim that the moral law is knowable independently of Sinai. Each E-item individually describes a channel of knowledge. The claim that this DISTINGUISHES moral from ceremonial/civil law requires the additional step of observing that nature and conscience do not attest ceremonial content. This additional step, while consistent with the E/N items, involves systematizing across multiple observations. | #5 (systematizing); #4a (SIS -- Rom 1:19-20 and Rom 2:14-15 are in the same epistle as Paul's Decalogue discussion in Rom 7:7-14; the connection is verified by shared vocabulary: nomos in both contexts) |
| I10 | The objection that "since God commanded all 613 laws, all are equally 'moral' and the distinction is meaningless" fails because the Bible itself distinguishes the Decalogue from other legislation through multiple independent markers. The objection conflates "all laws come from God" (true) with "all laws have the same origin, medium, repository, speaker, permanence, naming, and attestation channels" (false). The Bible demonstrates: (a) different speaker for the Decalogue (God's voice, E1-E2) vs. mediated legislation (Moses, E9); (b) different author (God's finger, E3-E4, vs. Moses' hand, E9); (c) different medium (stone, E3-E4, vs. scroll, E9); (d) different repository (inside the ark, E7-E8, vs. beside, E9); (e) different boundary ("he added no more," E2); (f) different naming ("his covenant, even ten commandments," E5, vs. "this law," E9); (g) different attestation channels (nature and conscience attest moral law, E63, E64, E37, E66; they do not attest ceremonial/civil law). | I-A | E1-E9 (seven markers of distinction). E63, E64, E37, E66 (nature and conscience as independent witnesses). N1 (two delivery modes). N2 (two repositories). N3 (law's attributes mirror God's). N7 (three channels attest moral content). I2 (categorical distinction). The claim assembles these into a direct response to a specific theological objection. All components are from the E/N/I tables. | The claim goes beyond any single E/N item by synthesizing all seven distinguishing markers plus the three attestation channels into a response to a specific objection. The objection itself is an external claim ("all 613 laws are equally moral"). The response uses only textual evidence. This is a systematization of existing evidence applied to a specific counter-argument. | #5 (systematizing existing E/N items into a direct response to an objection) |

### I-B Resolution: I6 -- Cessation Passages Refer to Ceremonial Ordinances Only

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (cessation = ceremonial only): E53 (Eph 2:15 uses dogma, not nomos/entole), E54 (Col 2:14 uses dogma), E56 (Heb 10:1 specifies "those sacrifices"), E10-E11 (Paul calls the law holy, just, good, spiritual in present tense), E25 (faith establishes the law), E38-E40 (new covenant writes the same law on hearts), word study showing dogma is never used for moral law.
- AGAINST (cessation may include moral law): E48 (2 Cor 3:7 "written and engraven in stones" with "done away"), E55 (Col 2:16-17 mentions "sabbath days" as shadow), E58 (Gal 3:19 "the law" added "till the seed"), E59 (Gal 3:24-25 "no longer under a schoolmaster").

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E53 | Plain | Uses dogma; the vocabulary itself identifies the referent as ordinances/decrees, not the moral law. |
| E54 | Plain | Same as E53; dogma specifies the referent. |
| E56 | Plain | Explicitly mentions "those sacrifices" -- the sacrificial system. |
| E10-E11 | Plain | Direct declarative statements about the law's nature (holy, just, good, spiritual) using the Decalogue as the identified referent (Rom 7:7). |
| E25 | Plain | Declarative with strongest denial formula ("God forbid"). |
| E38-E40 | Plain | Direct speech from God: "my law...write it in their hearts" / "cause you to walk in my statutes." |
| E48 | Contextually Clear | "Written and engraven in stones" identifies the Decalogue, but "done away" applies grammatically to "the glory of his countenance" (v. 7b) and "that which is abolished" (v. 13) refers to the veil context. Requires contextual awareness. |
| E55 | Ambiguous | "Sabbath days" could refer to weekly or annual sabbaths. The text does not specify. |
| E58 | Ambiguous | "The law" (nomos) has multiple senses; the specific referent is unspecified. |
| E59 | Ambiguous | Same as E58; "the law" is unspecified as to which aspect. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR side: Multiple Plain statements (E53, E54, E56, E10-E11, E25, E38-E40) -- 8 items at Plain level.
AGAINST side: One Contextually Clear (E48) and three Ambiguous (E55, E58, E59).
The FOR side has substantially more Plain statements.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements determine the reading of the Ambiguous ones. E53-E54 (Plain) show that when Paul specifies what was abolished, he uses dogma -- a word never used for the moral law. E10-E11 (Plain) show that in the same epistle (Romans), Paul calls the Decalogue holy, just, good, spiritual. E38-E40 (Plain) show God promises to write "my law" on hearts. These clear passages govern the reading of E58-E59 (Ambiguous "the law" in Galatians) and E55 (Ambiguous "sabbath days"). The Ambiguous passages should be read consistently with the Plain passages: "the law" in the cessation passages likely refers to the ceremonial/regulatory system or the law's condemning function, not the moral law itself.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate**
Plain statements on the FOR side dominate. The AGAINST side relies primarily on Ambiguous passages (E55, E58, E59) and one Contextually Clear passage (E48). The weight of Plain evidence favors the reading that cessation passages address ceremonial ordinances (dogma) or the law's old-covenant administration, not the moral law. The resolution is Moderate rather than Strong because E48 (2 Cor 3:7) explicitly references "written and engraven in stones" (the Decalogue) in a "done away" context, requiring contextual analysis rather than being purely Ambiguous.

---

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases actual verse text. Checked.
- Each is the plain meaning of the words. Checked.
- E-items report what the text SAYS, not what a position infers. Checked. (N5 was moved to I-A during N-CHECK because the Abolished position could dispute the entailment.)

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- All 46 Continues E-items passed all four validation gates of Tree 3 or were reclassified from Neutral to Continues because evidence of a distinction between law categories supports the Continues position. Verified.
- All cessation-vocabulary E-items (E53, E54, E55, E56, E57, E58, E59, E60, E61) went through Gate analysis and were reclassified to Neutral due to Gate 1 failures (referent identified as ceremonial/ambiguous) or Gate 2 failures (semantic range). Verified.
- No E-item is classified Abolished because every cessation passage either (a) uses dogma instead of nomos/entole (identifying the referent as ceremonial), (b) has an ambiguous referent, or (c) has a harmony conflict resolved by SIS.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- N1: Two delivery modes -- unavoidable from E1, E2, E9. Verified.
- N2: Two repositories -- unavoidable from E7, E8, E9. Verified.
- N3: Same attributes used for law and God -- unavoidable lexical observation. Verified.
- N4: Paul identifies the Decalogue by quoting the 10th commandment -- unavoidable. Verified.
- N5: Reclassified to I-A (I1) because the entailment that law MUST continue could be disputed by an Abolished scholar positing a replacement law. Verified.
- N6: Replacement tablets have identical content -- unavoidable from the text. Verified.
- N7: Three independent channels (nature, conscience, direct revelation) attest moral content -- observable from E63, E64, E65, E37, E66, E1-E4. All three N-tier tests pass: both sides acknowledge these channels exist; no interpretation is required; no concept is added. Verified.
- N8: Psalm 19 transitions from creation testimony (vv. 1-6) to law attributes (vv. 7-11) -- structural observation in the same psalm. Verified.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
- I1: Components (E23, E24, E46) all in E table. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A.
- I2: Components (E1-E9, N1-N2, E53-E54, word study) all in E/N tables. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A (but note it systematizes many items). Wait -- I2 also references "word study" about dogma. The word study observation about dogma usage IS in the E table (E53, E54 note that dogma is used, and E53's Tree 3 trace notes dogma is never used for moral law). This lexical observation is part of the E-item analysis. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A.
- I3: Components (E34, E35, E36) all in E table. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A.
- I4: Components (E37, E23, E45, E36) all in E table. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A.
- I5: Components (E38, E39, E40) all in E table. Text-derived. But note: the step of reasoning that "my law" = the same content (not a new law) involves interpretive judgment. Still, all vocabulary is in the E table. The possessives are textual. Confirmed I-A (with notation that criterion #4b applies minimally).
- I6: Both sides have E/N items. Confirmed I-B. Full SIS resolution provided.
- I7: Requires adding concepts not in the text (all laws = one unit; dogma includes moral law; fulfilled = terminated). Overrides E10-E11, E21-E22, E25, E38-E40. Confirmed I-D.
- I8: "Moral/ceremonial/civil" labels are not in the text. External framework. Does not override any E/N statement (compatible with the data). Confirmed I-C.
- I9: Components (E63, E64, E65, E37, E66, N7) all in E/N tables. Text-derived. The observation that nature/conscience do not attest ceremonial content is verifiable from the text (no passage claims creation reveals sacrifice procedures or feast calendars). Confirmed I-A.
- I10: Components (E1-E9, E63, E64, E37, E66, N1-N3, N7, I2) all in E/N/I tables. Text-derived. Systematizes all distinguishing markers plus attestation channels into a response to a specific objection. Confirmed I-A.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
- I1: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I2: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I3-I4: Same. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I5: Does not require redefining E/N. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I6: Requires E48 ("written and engraven in stones...done away") to be read as referring to the ministration/glory rather than the law itself. This is a choice between readings. Confirmed conflicts on at least one E-item (I-B).
- I7: Requires E10 ("the law is holy") to mean something other than ongoing moral authority, E25 ("we establish the law") to not mean confirmation, E21 ("not come to destroy") to mean "came to complete and end." Confirmed conflicts (I-D).
- I8: Does not require redefining any E/N. Confirmed compatible (I-C).
- I9: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I10: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. Confirmed aligns (I-A).

**Step E: Run consistency checks.**
- I1 (I-A): Only requires #5. Confirmed.
- I2 (I-A): Only requires #5. Confirmed.
- I3-I4 (I-A): Only require #5. Confirmed.
- I5 (I-A): Requires #5 and minor #4b. #4b is documented. The cross-reference (Jer 31:33 vocabulary matching Sinai vocabulary) is verified by shared Hebrew terms (torah, choq, mishpat). This qualifies as #4a (SIS with verified textual connection) rather than #4b. Reclassify the criterion note: #5 + #4a. Still I-A. Confirmed.
- I6 (I-B): E/N items on both sides. Confirmed.
- I7 (I-D): Overrides E10, E11, E21, E22, E25, E38-E40. Confirmed.
- I8 (I-C): Overrides nothing. Confirmed.
- I9 (I-A): Only requires #5 and #4a. The #4a connection (Rom 1:19-20 and Rom 2:14-15 in the same epistle as Rom 7:7-14) is verified by shared vocabulary (nomos). Confirmed.
- I10 (I-A): Only requires #5. Confirmed.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- I5: Jer 31:33 uses torah (H8451), the same term used throughout the OT for God's law. Heb 8:10 uses nomos (G3551), the standard LXX translation of torah. The connection is verified by shared vocabulary. #4a applies. Confirmed.
- I6: The SIS resolution for the I-B item is documented in full above. Confirmed.
- I9: Rom 1:19-20 and Rom 2:14-15 are in the same epistle as Paul's Decalogue discussion (Rom 7:7-14). The shared vocabulary (nomos, G3551) and the same authorial argument flow verify the connection. #4a applies. Confirmed.

### What CAN Be Said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies)

1. God spoke the Ten Commandments directly to Israel with His own voice; He spoke no other laws this way (E1, E2).
2. God wrote the Ten Commandments with His own finger on stone tablets (E3, E4).
3. The tablets were placed inside the ark of the covenant; the book of the law was placed beside the ark (E7, E8, E9, N2).
4. The Bible uses two different delivery modes for the Decalogue and the broader legislation (N1).
5. Paul calls the law (identified as the Decalogue by the 10th commandment) holy, just, good, and spiritual (E10, E11, N4).
6. The Psalms declare the law perfect, sure, right, pure, clean, true, and righteous (E12, E13).
7. Multiple passages state the commandments "stand fast for ever and ever," are "settled in heaven," "endure for ever," and are "everlasting" (E14, E15, E16, E17, E18, E19, E20).
8. Jesus states He did not come to destroy the law, and that not one jot or tittle will pass until heaven and earth pass (E21, E22).
9. Sin is defined as the transgression of the law (E23).
10. Faith does not make the law void; faith establishes the law (E25).
11. The new covenant writes "my law" on hearts (E38, E39).
12. The Spirit enables obedience to the same statutes and judgments (E40).
13. God's end-time people are identified as keeping the commandments of God (E31, E32, E33).
14. Abraham kept God's commandments before Sinai (E34).
15. Gentiles have the work of the law written on their hearts (E37).
16. The NT passages that specify what was abolished use the word dogma (ordinances/decrees), not nomos or entole (E53, E54).
17. The attributes ascribed to the law are the same attributes ascribed to God Himself (N3).
18. God's attributes are knowable through the created order: "the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen" (E63, Rom 1:19-20). The heavens "declare the glory of God" universally (E64, Psa 19:1-4). God "left not himself without witness" to all nations (E65, Acts 14:17).
19. Gentiles have the "work of the law written in their hearts" and their "conscience also bearing witness" -- an internal moral witness operating independently of the written law (E37, E66, Rom 2:14-15).
20. The Bible presents three independent channels attesting moral content: nature, conscience, and direct revelation (N7). None of these channels attest ceremonial or civil legislation.

### What CANNOT Be Said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture)

1. Scripture does not use the terms "moral law," "ceremonial law," or "civil law" as category labels. The threefold classification is a theological framework, not a biblical term (I8).
2. Scripture does not explicitly state that "the entire law system was abolished at the cross." The passages cited for abolition use dogma, not nomos/entole, and specify ceremonial items (E53, E54, E56). The claim that ALL law was abolished requires adding concepts the text does not state (I7).
3. Scripture does not explicitly state whether "sabbath days" in Colossians 2:16 refers to the weekly Sabbath or the annual ceremonial sabbaths. The text is ambiguous on this point (E55).
4. Scripture does not explicitly state what "the law" refers to in Galatians 3:19, 24-25 -- whether the entire Sinai legislation, the ceremonial system, or the law's condemning function. The referent is not specified (E58, E59).
5. Scripture does not explicitly state whether telos in Romans 10:4 means "termination" or "goal." Both meanings are within the word's semantic range (E61).
6. Scripture does not explicitly state whether 2 Corinthians 3:7-14 declares the Decalogue itself abolished or only the old covenant administration/glory abolished. The passage requires contextual analysis (E48).
7. Neither the Continues position nor the Abolished position can claim their full systematic framework is explicitly stated by any single passage. Both involve systematizing multiple passages (I1-I5, I9-I10 for Continues; I7 for Abolished).
8. Scripture does not explicitly state that "all 613 laws are equally moral." The Bible provides seven independent markers distinguishing the Decalogue from other legislation (E1-E9, N1-N2) and three attestation channels of which only the moral law is attested by all three (N7). The claim that all laws are undifferentiated requires denying these textual distinctions (I10).

---

## Analysis

### The Decalogue's Unique Origin

The Bible presents the Ten Commandments as categorically distinct from all other legislation through seven textual markers:

1. **God's own voice** -- "God spake all these words" (Exodus 20:1). "The LORD talked with you face to face" (Deuteronomy 5:4). "He added no more" (Deuteronomy 5:22). No other laws were delivered by God's direct speech to the assembled people.

2. **God's own finger** -- "Written with the finger of God" (Exodus 31:18; Deuteronomy 9:10). "The writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables" (Exodus 32:16). No other legislation was written by God Himself.

3. **Stone medium** -- The law was engraved on stone tablets (Exodus 24:12; 32:15-16; 34:1, 4; Deuteronomy 10:1-5). Stone is a permanent medium; the broader legislation was written in a book (Deuteronomy 31:24).

4. **Inside the ark** -- The tablets were placed inside the ark (Exodus 25:16, 21; 40:20; Deuteronomy 10:5). "There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone" (1 Kings 8:9). The book of the law was placed beside the ark (Deuteronomy 31:26).

5. **"He added no more"** -- After speaking the Ten Commandments, "he added no more" (Deuteronomy 5:22). All subsequent legislation came through Moses as intermediary.

6. **Called "the covenant"** -- "He declared unto you his covenant, even ten commandments" (Deuteronomy 4:13). "The words of the covenant, the ten commandments" (Exodus 34:28).

7. **Called "the testimony"** -- "Two tables of testimony" (Exodus 31:18). "The tables of the testimony" (Exodus 32:15). These tablets served as God's own witness/testimony within the ark.

### Attributes Mirroring God's Character

The Bible ascribes attributes to the law that it also ascribes to God:

| Attribute | Applied to the Law | Applied to God |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Holy | Romans 7:12 | Leviticus 19:2; 1 Peter 1:15-16 |
| Just | Romans 7:12 | Deuteronomy 32:4 |
| Good | Romans 7:12, 16; 1 Timothy 1:8 | Psalm 119:68 |
| Spiritual | Romans 7:14 | John 4:24 |
| Perfect | Psalm 19:7; James 1:25 | Matthew 5:48; Deuteronomy 32:4 |
| Eternal | Psalm 111:7-8; 119:89, 152, 160 | Isaiah 57:15 |
| True | Psalm 119:142, 151 | John 14:6 |
| Pure | Psalm 19:8 | 1 John 3:3 |
| Righteous | Psalm 119:137-138, 172 | Psalm 119:137 |

Paul's statements in Romans 7:12, 14 are made in the present tense ("the law IS holy...the law IS spiritual") and are preceded by his strongest denial formula when asked if the law is sin ("God forbid," Romans 7:7). He identifies the law in question as the Decalogue by quoting the 10th commandment (Romans 7:7: "Thou shalt not covet").

### Universal and Eternal Scope

The evidence for the law's scope extends across four dimensions:

**Before Sinai:** Genesis 26:5 states Abraham "kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws" -- using the same Hebrew terminology as the Sinai legislation. Genesis 4:7-10 shows God holding Cain accountable for murder. Genesis 39:9 shows Joseph identifying adultery as "sin against God." Romans 5:12-14 argues that sin and death from Adam to Moses presuppose an operative law.

**Beyond Israel:** Romans 2:14-15 states Gentiles have "the work of the law written in their hearts." Ecclesiastes 12:13 identifies commandment-keeping as "the whole duty of man" (adam -- humanity).

**Into the New Covenant:** Jeremiah 31:33 promises "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts." Hebrews 8:10 and 10:16 repeat this promise. Ezekiel 36:27 specifies the Spirit "causes" obedience to the same statutes. Romans 3:31 states faith "establishes" the law.

**To the End of Time:** Revelation 12:17 and 14:12 identify God's end-time people as those who "keep the commandments of God." Revelation 22:14 pronounces a blessing on those who "do his commandments." Matthew 5:18 and Luke 16:17 declare the law will not pass away while heaven and earth exist.

### Three Biblical Witnesses to the Moral Law

The Bible presents three independent channels through which moral law is known, each operating without dependence on the Sinai revelation:

**1. Knowledge of God through nature (Rom 1:19-20; Psa 19:1-4; Acts 14:17).** Paul states that "the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse" (Romans 1:19-20). The Greek gnoston (G1110, "knowable") and phaneron (G5318, "manifest") indicate that knowledge of God's moral character is accessible through creation. Psalm 19:1-4 states "the heavens declare the glory of God" and "their line is gone out through all the earth" -- a universal testimony. Acts 14:17 records Paul telling Gentiles that God "left not himself without witness" through the natural order. The result (anapologetous, [G379](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g379/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, "without excuse") indicates moral accountability based on this natural revelation.

**2. Conscience (Rom 2:14-15).** Paul states that Gentiles "which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law" and "shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness." The Greek syneidesis (G4893, "conscience") describes an internal moral faculty that "accuses or excuses" (katego-rounton e kai apologoumenon). This faculty operates independently of the written Decalogue, yet attests the same moral content -- since what Gentiles do "by nature" (physei, G5449) corresponds to "the things contained in the law" (ta tou nomou).

**3. Direct revelation (the Decalogue itself).** The Decalogue, delivered by God's own voice (E1-E2), written by God's own finger (E3-E4), engraved on stone (E3-E4), and placed inside the ark (E7-E8), constitutes the explicit, formal codification of the moral law.

These three channels converge on the same moral content: do not murder, do not steal, do not commit adultery, do not lie. They do not converge on ceremonial content. No one can discern from nature that a lamb must be sacrificed at Passover, that the Day of Atonement falls on Tishri 10, or that a leper must present two birds and cedarwood for purification. No one can derive from conscience that tithes must be brought to the Levitical storehouse or that a Nazirite must abstain from grape products. Ceremonial and civil legislation required specific divine revelation through Moses -- it is not attested by nature or conscience.

This three-channel attestation supports the distinction between the moral law and other categories of legislation: moral law is knowable through nature, conscience, AND direct revelation; ceremonial and civil law are knowable only through specific revelation.

### Addressing the Objection: "All 613 Laws Are Equally Moral"

The objection states: since God commanded all 613 laws, all are equally "moral," and the distinction between moral and ceremonial law is meaningless. This objection conflates "all laws come from God" (which the text affirms) with "all laws have the same origin, medium, repository, speaker, permanence, naming, and attestation channels" (which the text denies).

The Bible itself provides seven independent markers distinguishing the Decalogue from all other legislation:

1. **Different speaker:** God spoke the Decalogue directly (Exo 20:1; Deu 5:4, 22) -- "he added no more." All subsequent laws came through Moses (Deu 5:31).
2. **Different author:** God wrote the Decalogue with His finger (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10). Moses wrote the book of the law (Deu 31:24).
3. **Different medium:** Stone tablets vs. a scroll/book.
4. **Different repository:** Inside the ark (Exo 25:16; 40:20; 1 Ki 8:9) vs. beside the ark (Deu 31:26).
5. **Different boundary:** "He added no more" (Deu 5:22) marks the Decalogue as a complete, bounded unit.
6. **Different naming:** "His covenant, even ten commandments" (Deu 4:13) vs. "this law" and "the book of the covenant" (Deu 31:24; Exo 24:7).
7. **Different attestation channels:** Moral law is attested by nature, conscience, AND direct revelation. Ceremonial/civil law is attested only by specific revelation through Moses.

The seventh marker is the contribution of the new investigation. If all 613 laws were "equally moral" in the same sense, one would expect nature and conscience to attest all of them equally. They do not. The heavens declare God's glory and moral character (Psa 19:1-4), and Gentiles do "by nature the things contained in the law" (Rom 2:14-15), but neither nature nor conscience reveals the specifications of the sacrificial system, the feast calendar, or the civil restitution formulas.

The objection is correct that all laws originate from God. The objection is incorrect that the Bible treats all laws identically. The text itself draws distinctions that the objection must deny to sustain its claim.

### The "Temporary" Passages

The passages listed under Nave's "TEMPORARY" heading require identification of what the text says is temporary. The analysis reveals:

- Ephesians 2:15 and Colossians 2:14 use **dogma** (G1378) for what was abolished/nailed to the cross. This word is never used for the moral law in the NT. These passages address ceremonial ordinances.

- Hebrews 10:1 specifies "those sacrifices" as the shadow. The context is the priestly/sacrificial system, not the Decalogue.

- Hebrews 8:13 says the old covenant arrangement is "vanishing," but the same passage (v. 10) states the law is written on hearts in the new covenant.

- 2 Corinthians 3:7-14 references what was "written and engraven in stones" and uses cessation language. The grammatical subject of "done away" is debated between the ministration/glory and the law itself. The passage is addressed by a later study.

- Galatians 3:19, 24-25 uses "the law" without specifying the referent as moral or ceremonial. The passage is addressed by a later study.

- Romans 10:4 uses telos, which can mean either "termination" or "goal." The passage is addressed by a later study.

- Colossians 2:16-17 lists "sabbath days" among shadows. The referent (weekly vs. annual sabbaths) is unspecified. The passage is addressed by a later study.

In this study's scope, the passages that clearly identify their referent use dogma for what was abolished and specify ceremonial items (sacrifices, meats, drinks). The passages that are ambiguous require further study to determine the referent of "the law."

## Conclusion

Across 66 explicit statements, 7 necessary implications, and 10 inferences, this study's evidence distributes as follows: 46 explicit statements support the Continues position -- 35 use law-continuation vocabulary applied to the Decalogue/moral law (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal, established by faith, kept by end-time saints, written on hearts), and 11 evidence a categorical distinction between law types (different delivery mode, different authorship, different naming, different repository, different NT vocabulary). Four necessary implications support Continues by establishing delivery mode, repository, characterization distinctions, and three independent attestation channels (nature, conscience, direct revelation). Zero explicit statements use cessation vocabulary applied to the moral law/Decalogue after passing the four validation gates. All cessation-vocabulary E-items were reclassified to Neutral because the text's own vocabulary identifies the referent as ceremonial ordinances (dogma), or the referent is ambiguous, or there is a harmony conflict resolved by SIS.

The updated investigation adds four new explicit observations (E63-E66) documenting natural revelation (Rom 1:19-20), creation's testimony (Psa 19:1-4), God's witness through nature (Acts 14:17), and the conscience mechanism (Rom 2:15). Two new necessary implications (N7-N8) establish that the Bible presents three independent channels attesting moral content and that Psalm 19 structurally links creation's testimony to the law's attributes. Two new I-A inferences (I9-I10) systematize this evidence: I9 establishes that moral law is knowable independently of Sinai (distinguishing it from ceremonial/civil law), and I10 responds directly to the objection that all 613 laws are equally "moral" by assembling all seven distinguishing markers plus the three attestation channels.

The single I-D inference (I7: all law abolished) requires overriding or redefining multiple E-items (E10, E11, E21, E22, E25, E38-E40). The seven I-A inferences (I1-I5, I9-I10) use only vocabulary and concepts from the E/N tables and require only systematization.
