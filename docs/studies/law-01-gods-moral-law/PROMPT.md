# Bible Study: God's Moral Law -- Basis, Nature, and Scope

## Question
What is God's moral law? What is its basis, nature, and scope? Investigate the Decalogue's unique origin (God's voice, God's finger, stone, inside the Ark), its attributes that mirror God's character (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal), and its universal/eternal scope. Examine Exodus 20:1-17, Deuteronomy 4:13, Deuteronomy 5:22, Deuteronomy 10:1-5, Exodus 25:16, Exodus 31:18, Exodus 32:15-16, Romans 7:12, Romans 7:14, Psalm 19:7-9, Psalm 111:7-8, Psalm 119.

## Series Context
This is **law-01** in the Law of God series. Read and follow the methodology in `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-series-methodology.md`. This includes:
- The investigative methodology (investigator, not advocate)
- Evidence classification framework (E/N/I with I-A through I-D subtypes)
- Classification decision trees (Trees 1-5)
- Verification phase requirements
- Master evidence file tracking (`law-master-evidence.md`)
- Tally summary format
- Conclusion tone rule (present data, no editorializing)

#### E. Psalm 119 -- Extended Meditation on God's Law
The longest chapter in the Bible is entirely devoted to the law of God, using eight terms:

- mitsvah (H4687) -- commandment (v. 96)
- mishpat (H4941) -- judgments (vv. 7, 43, 84, 132, 149, 160)
- choq (H2706) -- statutes (vv. 5, etc.)
- edah (H5715) -- testimonies
- dabar (H1697) -- word
- piqqud (H6490) -- precepts
- imrah (H565) -- promise/word

**Key findings from related study conclusions:**

1. **gods-moral-law**: The Decalogue is distinguished from all other laws by seven unique markers: (1) spoken by God's voice, (2) "he added no more," (3) written by God's finger, (4) written on stone, (5) placed inside the Ark, (6) called "the covenant" itself, (7) called "the testimony." Its attributes (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal) mirror God's own character. It existed before Sinai (GEN 26:5), defines sin universally (1JN 3:4), is written on hearts in the new covenant (JER 31:33), and is kept by end-time saints (REV 14:12).

2. **nt-commandments-vs-ordinances**: The Greek vocabulary encodes the distinction. entole (G1785) is used for moral commandments that continue; dogma (G1378) is used for ceremonial ordinances that were abolished. dogma is never used for God's moral commandments. The "handwriting of ordinances" nailed to the cross (COL 2:14) uses dogma, not entole.

3. **law-of-moses**: "Law of Moses" emphasizes the human mediator; "law of God" emphasizes the divine Author. In Paul's theology, "law of God" specifically denotes the moral law/Decalogue (ROM 7:7,22,25; 8:7). "Law of Moses" is never used exclusively for the Ten Commandments.

4. **covenant-relationship-to-law**: The new covenant does not abolish the moral law but internalizes it. JER 31:33 promises the same torah written on hearts. Faith "establishes" (histemi) the law (ROM 3:31). The Spirit "causes" obedience to the same statutes (EZK 36:27). The ceremonial system ends; the moral law continues.

### Focus Areas
(Derived from tool discoveries, not training knowledge)

1. **The seven distinguishing marks of the Decalogue** -- The Nave's entries for DECALOGUE, LAW, and COMMANDMENTS consistently highlight the unique origin features: God's voice (EXO 20:1; DEU 5:4,22), God's finger (EXO 31:18; DEU 9:10), stone medium (EXO 24:12; 32:15-16), inside the Ark (EXO 25:16; DEU 10:1-5; 1KI 8:9), "he added no more" (DEU 5:22), called "the covenant" (DEU 4:13; EXO 34:28), called "the testimony" (EXO 31:18; 34:29). These must be documented as explicit statements.

2. **Attributes mirroring God's character** -- The LAW entry in Nave's and the WORD OF GOD entry both point to PSA 19:7-9 and ROM 7:12,14 as primary texts. The research agent should systematically trace each attribute (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, pure, true, eternal) in both the law passages and the God-description passages, building the parallel table.

3. **Psalm 119 survey** -- As the longest chapter in Scripture, entirely devoted to God's law, Psalm 119 uses eight Hebrew terms for the law (torah, mitsvah, mishpat, choq, edah, dabar, piqqud, imrah). The research agent should identify key verses that speak to the eternality, perfection, universality, and moral character of the law.

4. **Pre-Sinai evidence** -- GEN 26:5 uses four terms for law (mitsvot, chuqqot, torot) applied to Abraham. ROM 5:12-14 affirms sin (and therefore law) existed from Adam to Moses. GEN 4:7 and 39:7-9 demonstrate moral awareness before Sinai.

5. **Universal scope via Romans 2:14-15** -- Gentiles "do by nature the things contained in the law" and show "the work of the law written in their hearts." This extends the moral law beyond Israel.

6. **New covenant internalization** -- JER 31:33; HEB 8:10; 10:16 promise the same law written on hearts. EZK 36:27 specifies the Spirit causes obedience to the same statutes. ROM 3:31 says faith establishes the law.

7. **End-time relevance** -- REV 12:17; 14:12; 22:14 identify God's end-time people as commandment-keepers. The entole (G1785) in these verses is the same word used for moral commandments throughout the NT.

8. **Contrast with the book of the law** -- DEU 31:9,24,26 places the book of the law "in the side of the ark" while the Ten Commandments are INSIDE the ark (DEU 10:1-5; 1KI 8:9). This physical separation is documented in the Nave's LAW entry.

9. **The "temporary" classification in Nave's** -- Nave's LAW entry includes a "TEMPORARY" subheading with references (JER 3:16; MAT 5:17-45; ROM 7:1-6; 2CO 3:7-14; GAL 2:3-9; EPH 2:15; COL 2:14-23; HEB 8:4-13). The research agent MUST retrieve and document these verses alongside the "continuation" verses for both-sides investigation per the law series methodology.

2. Read your agent instructions at `C:/Users/Michael/.claude/skills/bible-study2/agents/research-agent.md` (Windows)
3. Read the law series methodology at `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-series-methodology.md` for the classification framework
4. Follow the answer-question workflow from the skill
5. Write research files to this folder (`D:/bible/bible-studies/law-01-gods-moral-law/`):
   - `01-topics.md` - Nave's topics and full entries (DECALOGUE, LAW, COMMANDMENTS, COVENANT, OBEDIENCE, WORD OF GOD, SIN, HOLINESS)
   - `02-verses.md` - All verse texts retrieved with context, organized by the categories above (A through E)

   - `raw-data/` - Raw tool output organized by category
6. **CRITICAL**: Retrieve BOTH continuation AND abolition passages. The Nave's LAW entry "TEMPORARY" section lists passages cited by the Abolished position. These MUST be retrieved alongside the continuation passages per the law series methodology.
7. Run cross-testament parallels for the primary verses (EXO 20:1-17, ROM 7:12, ROM 7:14, PSA 19:7, PSA 111:7-8, 1JN 3:4, REV 14:12)
8. Do NOT write `03-analysis.md` or `CONCLUSION.md` -- those are for the analysis agent
