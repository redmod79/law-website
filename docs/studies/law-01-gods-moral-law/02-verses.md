> 2 Corinthians 3:7 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:
> 2 Corinthians 3:8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
> 2 Corinthians 3:9 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
> 2 Corinthians 3:10 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
> 2 Corinthians 3:11 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.

> 2 Corinthians 3:14 But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.

**Galatians 3:19, 24-25** (law was schoolmaster)
> Galatians 3:19 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
> Galatians 3:24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

> Hebrews 10:1 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.

### F2. Critical Word Study Note for "Temporary" Passages
- Ephesians 2:15 uses **dogma** (G1378) -- "decrees/ordinances" -- NOT nomos (G3551) for law
- Colossians 2:14 uses **dogma** (G1378) -- "handwriting of ordinances" -- NOT nomos
- These "ordinances" (dogma) are distinguished from the moral law (nomos/entole)
- Hebrews 10:1 speaks of "sacrifices" and "shadows" -- ceremonial system, not the Decalogue
- 2 Corinthians 3:7 speaks of "the ministration of death" -- the condemnation function, not the law itself (cf. Rom 7:12 where the law is still called "holy, just, good")
