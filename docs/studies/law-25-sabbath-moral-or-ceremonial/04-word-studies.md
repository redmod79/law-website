## shabbathown -- [H7677](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7677/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (noun)
**Original:** שַׁבָּתוֹן
**Transliteration:** shabbathown
**Pronunciation:** shab-baw-thone
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 11

**Definition:** From [H7676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7676/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; a sabbatism or special holiday -- rest, sabbath.

### Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|---|---|---|
| of rest | 7 | 63.6% |
| a sabbath | 3 | 27.3% |
| the rest | 1 | 9.1% |

### Key Distribution Pattern
- Used for both the weekly Sabbath AND ceremonial rest days
- Weekly Sabbath usage: Exo 16:23; 31:15; 35:2; Lev 23:3 -- always paired with shabbath as "shabbath shabbathown" (sabbath of complete rest)
- Ceremonial usage: Lev 23:24 (Trumpets), 23:39 (Tabernacles) -- used ALONE as "shabbathown" without the full "shabbath shabbathown" compound
- **Critical observation:** The weekly Sabbath gets the FULL compound "shabbath shabbathown" while ceremonial rest days get only "shabbathown" alone
- Lev 16:31 (Day of Atonement) and Lev 25:4-5 (sabbatical year) -- "shabbath shabbathown"
- Lev 23:32 (Day of Atonement) -- "shabbath shabbathown"

## moed -- [H4150](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4150/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (noun)
**Original:** מוֹעֵד
**Transliteration:** moed
**Pronunciation:** mo-ade
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 223

**Definition:** From yaad; properly, an appointment, i.e. a fixed time or season; specifically, a festival; conventionally a year; by implication, an assembly -- appointed (sign, time), (place of, solemn) assembly, congregation, (set, solemn) feast, (appointed, due) season, solemn(-ity), time (appointed).

| of the congregation | 146 | 63.8% |
| the feasts | 4 | 1.7% |
| appointed | 3 | 1.3% |

### Critical Observation
- Used in Gen 1:14 for "seasons" (moadim) -- the celestial markers for appointed times
- Used in Lev 23:2, 4, 37, 44 for "feasts" -- the appointed annual festivals
- **The weekly Sabbath is NEVER called moed** -- it is called shabbath (H7676)
- This vocabulary distinction separates the weekly Sabbath from the annual feast system

## chag -- [H2282](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2282/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (noun)
**Original:** חַג
**Transliteration:** chag
**Pronunciation:** khag
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 62

**Definition:** From chagag; a festival, or a victim therefor -- (solemn) feast (day), sacrifice, solemnity.

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|---|---|---|
| a feast | 12 | 17.4% |
| the feast | 12 | 17.4% |
| feast | 10 | 14.5% |

### Critical Observation
- Used exclusively for the three pilgrimage feasts (Unleavened Bread, Weeks, Tabernacles)
- **The weekly Sabbath is NEVER called chag** -- it is called shabbath
- This further distinguishes the weekly Sabbath from the annual feast system
- The weekly Sabbath uses different vocabulary (shabbath), different work prohibition level (kol-melakhah vs melekhet abodah), and different classification

## bad / millibad -- [H905](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h905/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (noun/preposition)
**Original:** בַּד
**Transliteration:** bad
**Pronunciation:** bad
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 56 (BLB) / 203 (translation entries including prepositional uses)

**Definition:** From badad; properly, separation; by implication, a part of the body, branch of a tree, bar for carrying; figuratively, chief of a city; especially (with prepositional prefix) as an adverb, apart, only, besides -- alone, apart, bar, besides, branch, by self, of each alike, except, only, part, staff, strength.

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|---|---|---|
| beside | 33 | 16.3% |
| alone | 32 | 15.8% |
| only | 30 | 14.8% |
| apart | 11 | 5.4% |

### Critical Usage in Leviticus 23:38
- **millibad** (min + l + bad) = "from beside" / "apart from" / "beside"
- The preposition appears FOUR times in Lev 23:38, creating a fourfold separation:
  1. "Beside the sabbaths of the LORD" (shabbetot YHWH)
  2. "Beside your gifts"
  3. "Beside all your vows"
  4. "Beside all your freewill offerings"
- This grammatically places the weekly Sabbaths in a separate category from the feast sabbaths described in vv. 4-37

## zakar -- [H2142](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2142/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (verb)
**Original:** זָכַר
**Transliteration:** zakar
**Pronunciation:** zaw-kar
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Occurrences:** 233

**Definition:** A primitive root; properly, to mark (so as to be recognized), i.e. to remember; by implication, to mention; to be male -- burn (incense), earnestly, be male, (make) mention (of), be mindful, recount, record(-er), remember, make to be remembered, bring (call, come, keep, put) to (in) remembrance, still, think on, well.

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|---|---|---|
| Remember | 34 | 12.2% |
| remember | 25 | 9.0% |
| remembered | 19 | 6.8% |

### Critical Usage in Exodus 20:8
- **zakor** (Qal Infinitive Absolute) -- "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy"
- The Infinitive Absolute form intensifies the command
- This is a MEMORIAL verb -- it points BACKWARD to something already established
- In context, Exo 20:11 confirms what is being remembered: "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth...and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it"
- The past-tense verbs ("made," "rested," "blessed," "hallowed") confirm the backward-pointing memorial function
- Contrast with skia (G4639) which points FORWARD to "things to come"

- Used in Mark 2:27 -- "The sabbath was made for man"
- Also used for "week" (the period defined by the Sabbath cycle): Mat 28:1 "the first day of the week"
- Direct Greek transliteration of Hebrew shabbath (H7676)

## sabbatismos -- [G4520](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4520/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (noun)
**Original:** σαββατισμός
**Transliteration:** sabbatismos
**Pronunciation:** sab-bat-is-mos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 1 (hapax legomenon)

**Definition:** From a derivative of sabbaton; a "sabbatism," i.e. the repose of Christianity (as a type of heaven).

### The Single Occurrence -- Hebrews 4:9
Greek text: **ara apoleipetai sabbatismos to lao tou theou**
"So then there remains a Sabbath-keeping for the people of God."

### Grammatical Analysis (from greek_parser.py)
| Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing |
|---|---|---|---|
| ara | ara | [G686](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g686/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | Particle (therefore/so then) |
| apoleipetai | apoleipo | [G620](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g620/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | Present Passive Indicative 3rd Sg -- "is currently remaining" |
| sabbatismos | sabbatismos | [G4520](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4520/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | Nominative Singular Masculine |
| to | ho | [G3588](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3588/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | Dative Singular Masculine (the) |
| lao | laos | [G2992](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2992/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | Dative Singular Masculine (people) |
| tou | ho | [G3588](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3588/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | Genitive Singular Masculine (of the) |
| theou | theos | [G2316](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2316/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | Genitive Singular Masculine (God) |

### Critical Observations
1. **Hapax legomenon** -- occurs only here in the entire NT
2. **-ismos suffix** -- in Greek, -ismos (-ισμος) denotes the PRACTICE or ACT of something, not merely its existence. Compare: baptismos (the act of baptizing), exorcismos (the act of exorcising)
3. **Deliberate word switch** -- The author uses katapausis (G2663, "rest") 8 times in Heb 3-4, then switches to sabbatismos exactly ONCE in 4:9. This is intentional vocabulary selection.
4. **apoleipetai** -- Present Passive Indicative: "is currently remaining" -- indicates ongoing, present validity
5. **Context arc:** The passage traces Sabbath from creation (4:4, quoting Gen 2:2) through Israel through Joshua to "today" -- the Sabbath-keeping that "remains" is rooted in creation and continues to the present

## skia -- [G4639](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4639/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (noun)
**Original:** σκιά
**Transliteration:** skia
**Pronunciation:** skee-ah
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 7

**Definition:** Apparently a primary word; "shade" or a shadow (literally or figuratively -- darkness).

### All Occurrences
| Reference | Translation | Context |
|---|---|---|
| Mat 4:16 | shadow | "shadow of death" (quoting Isa 9:1) |
| Mrk 4:32 | shadow | mustard tree shadow (literal) |
| Luk 1:79 | shadow | "shadow of death" |
| Act 5:15 | shadow | Peter's shadow (literal) |
| Col 2:17 | a shadow | "which are a shadow of things to come" |
| Heb 8:5 | shadow | "serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things" |
| Heb 10:1 | a shadow | "the law having a shadow of good things to come" |

### Critical Observation
- The THEOLOGICAL usage (Col 2:17; Heb 8:5; 10:1) is FORWARD-pointing: "shadow of things TO COME"
- A shadow points AHEAD to its substance
- The weekly Sabbath uses zakar (REMEMBER) = BACKWARD-pointing to creation
- The ceremonial system uses skia (SHADOW) = FORWARD-pointing to Christ
- These are opposite directional vectors: memorial (backward) vs. shadow (forward)

## anthropos -- [G444](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g444/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (noun)
**Original:** ἄνθρωπος
**Transliteration:** anthropos
**Pronunciation:** anth-ro-pos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 559

**Definition:** Man-faced, i.e. a human being -- man, mankind.

| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|---|---|---|
| man | 133 | 27.3% |
| men | 115 | 23.6% |
| of man | 80 | 16.4% |

### Critical Usage in Mark 2:27
- "The sabbath was made for man [anthropon]"
- anthropos is GENERIC humanity -- not a specific ethnic group
- Not Ioudaios (Jewish person) or Israelites (Israel-specific)
- The article "ton" (the man) is used generically = "mankind" / "humanity"
- This supports the universal scope of the Sabbath institution

---

## ginomai -- [G1096](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1096/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (verb)
**Original:** γίνομαι
**Transliteration:** ginomai
**Pronunciation:** ghin-om-ahee
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Occurrences:** 678

**Definition:** To cause to be; to become, come into being.

### Critical Usage in Mark 2:27
- **egeneto** (ἐγένετο) -- Aorist Middle Indicative 3rd Singular
- "The sabbath was made [egeneto] for man"
- The AORIST tense points to a SPECIFIC past event of creation/making
- This is creation-event language: the Sabbath "came into being" at a definite point
- Combined with anthropos (generic humanity), this traces the Sabbath to creation for all mankind
- Same verb form used in Gen 1 LXX for "it came to pass" (creation events)

| 1 Pet 1:14 | "the former lusts in your ignorance" |

### Relevance to Accountability
- Acts 17:30 establishes that ignorance provided a measure of forbearance
- BUT ignorance does not provide PERMANENT exemption -- "but NOW commandeth all men every where to repent"
- The transition from ignorance to knowledge increases accountability

## hupereidon -- [G5237](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5237/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (verb)
**Original:** ὑπερείδω

| repent | 4 | 11.1% |

### Usage in Acts 17:30
- **metanoein** (Present Active Infinitive) -- "to repent" (ongoing, universal command)
- "God...now commandeth all men every where to repent [metanoein]"
- The Present tense of the infinitive indicates an ongoing, continuous command
- pantas (all) + pantachou (everywhere) = universal scope of the repentance command
- This connects to the accountability principle: as knowledge increases, the command to repent in light of that knowledge is universal

---

## qodesh -- [H6944](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6944/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (noun)
