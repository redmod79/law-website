# Prior Study Conclusions Summary

This file summarizes the conclusions from completed studies in the Law of God Bible Study Series and related Sabbath studies that are relevant to law-25 (Is the Sabbath Moral or Ceremonial?).

---

## law-01: God's Moral Law

**Question:** What is God's moral law?

**Summary:** The Decalogue (Ten Commandments) is God's eternal moral law, distinguished by seven unique markers from all other biblical legislation: (1) spoken by God's own voice, (2) written by God's own finger, (3) written on stone (permanence medium), (4) placed inside the Ark of the Covenant, (5) called "his covenant," (6) moral principles that reflect God's unchanging character, and (7) affirmed throughout both Testaments as enduring. The study identified 46 Continues E-items and 0 Abolished E-items. The moral law mirrors God's own character attributes.

**Relevance to law-25:** Establishes the criteria by which any commandment can be identified as moral law. The Sabbath must be tested against these seven markers.

---

## law-02: Law Before Sinai

**Question:** Did the moral law exist before Sinai?

**Summary:** Six independent lines of evidence demonstrate the moral law's pre-Sinai existence: (1) the Sabbath at creation (Gen 2:2-3), (2) Cain's knowledge of the murder prohibition (Gen 4:7-10), (3) Abraham "obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws" (Gen 26:5), (4) Joseph's recognition of adultery as "sin against God" (Gen 39:9), (5) the manna test for Sabbath observance before Sinai (Exo 16), and (6) the patriarchal understanding of theft, lying, and covetousness. 6 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items.

**Relevance to law-25:** Directly establishes the Sabbath's pre-Sinai existence, which is Criterion 1 (Creation Origin) for the moral/ceremonial question.

---

## law-03: Exodus 20 vs Later Laws

**Question:** What distinguishes the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20) from the laws given later?

**Summary:** Five dimensions distinguish the Decalogue from all subsequent legislation: (1) delivery mode (God's voice vs. Moses as mediator), (2) authorship (God's finger vs. Moses' writing), (3) repository (inside the Ark vs. beside the Ark), (4) naming ("my covenant/ten commandments" vs. "statutes and judgments"), and (5) boundary (the complete moral standard vs. applications and ceremonies). Deuteronomy 4:13-14 provides the most explicit textual distinction. 11 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items.

**Relevance to law-25:** Establishes Criteria 2-3 (Decalogue Membership, God's Voice/Finger/Stone). The Sabbath is embedded in the Decalogue by all five distinguishing dimensions.

---

## law-04: Ceremonial Laws

**Question:** What are the ceremonial laws and what is their relationship to the moral law?

**Summary:** The ceremonial law system was typological (pointing forward to Christ), temporary ("added because of transgressions, till the seed should come," Gal 3:19), and distinguished from the moral law by vocabulary, repository, authorship, and temporal scope. Leviticus 23:37-38 provides a "Critical Distinction" -- the millibad ("beside/apart from") separation explicitly distinguishes "the sabbaths of the LORD" (weekly Sabbath) from the feast system described in vv. 4-37. Colossians 2:16 sabbaths resolved as ceremonial sabbaths based on the heorte-neomenia-sabbaton triad. 6 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items.

**Relevance to law-25:** Directly establishes Criterion 4 (Lev 23:37-38 distinction) and addresses Criterion 5 (Typological function). The ceremonial criteria form the negative test: does the Sabbath match ceremonial characteristics?

---

## law-05: Civil/Judicial Laws

**Question:** What are the civil/judicial laws in the Pentateuch and how do they relate to the moral and ceremonial categories?

**Summary:** The mishpatim (H4941, "judgments") of Exodus 21-23 function as case-law applications of Decalogue moral principles. The Bible uses three functionally distinct terms for types of law: mitsvot (commandments), chuqqim (statutes), and mishpatim (judgments). Deuteronomy 4:13-14 explicitly distinguishes "his covenant, even ten commandments" from the "statutes and judgments" taught through Moses. The civil laws overlap with the ceremonial system at specific points. The NT transfers the judicial function to secular government (Rom 13:1-7) and the church community (1 Cor 6:1-8). 1 Continues E-item (Mat 23:23 -- judgment as a "weightier matter"), remainder Neutral.

**Relevance to law-25:** Confirms the three-category framework (moral/ceremonial/civil) and the Decalogue's distinct status within it.

---

## law-12: Matthew 5:17-20

**Question:** What does Jesus mean by "not come to destroy but to fulfil"?

**Summary:** Kataluo (G2647) consistently means demolish/annul; Jesus' double denial excludes abrogation as His purpose. Pleroo (G4137), determined by immediate context (vv. 18-19 affirm permanence), means to fill full with intended meaning -- to magnify the law (Isa 42:21). The permanence statement ties the law's duration to the cosmos. The "least commandments" are the commandments of "the law" just mentioned. The six antitheses deepen Decalogue/Torah commands to heart level; none are revoked. The exceeding righteousness is internal, Spirit-enabled obedience to the same law.

**Relevance to law-25:** Establishes that Jesus affirmed the entire moral law's continuing authority, including its "least commandments."

---

## law-13: Jesus and the Sabbath

**Question:** What do Jesus' Sabbath actions and teachings reveal about the Sabbath's continuing validity?

**Summary:** Every recorded Sabbath controversy shows Jesus arguing WITHIN the Sabbath's legal framework (using exesti, "is it lawful?"), never arguing that the Sabbath lacks binding authority. He declares His disciples "guiltless" (anaitioi) under the biblical Sabbath standard, defines lawful Sabbath activity (doing good, healing, loosing from bondage), and declares healing morally obligatory (edei) on the Sabbath. His settled custom (eiothos, Perfect tense) was Sabbath synagogue worship. As "Lord of the Sabbath" (kurios tou sabbatou), He exercises governing authority by defining the Sabbath's true requirements, not by abolishing it. Post-crucifixion evidence confirms continuity: the disciples rest "according to the commandment" (Luke 23:56), Jesus instructs prayer about Sabbath flight decades after the cross (Mat 24:20), and Paul's settled custom matches Jesus' (Acts 17:2). Hebrews 4:9 uses sabbatismos to affirm Sabbath-keeping "remaineth."

**Relevance to law-25:** Provides the NT behavioral evidence that Jesus treated the Sabbath as moral law (binding, authoritative, and to be properly observed -- not abolished).

---

## law-14: Jesus' Law Teachings

**Question:** What did Jesus specifically teach about the law and commandments?

**Summary:** Across all four Gospels and John's epistles, Jesus consistently affirms, deepens, and defends the moral law (Decalogue). He directs the rich young ruler to the Decalogue as the path to life (Mat 19:17-19). He identifies the two love commandments as the organizing principle on which all the law hangs (Mat 22:37-40). His "new commandment" uses kainos (new in quality), and John clarifies it is simultaneously "an old commandment from the beginning." Jesus equates "my commandments" with "my Father's commandments" (Jhn 15:10). John defines sin as anomia (lawlessness, 1 Jhn 3:4). Jesus affirms both weightier and lighter matters of the law as obligatory (Mat 23:23). No passage records Jesus abolishing any moral commandment.

**Relevance to law-25:** Confirms Jesus never abolished any Decalogue commandment, including the Sabbath.

---

## law-23: The "Law of Christ" and Related NT Law Phrases

**Question:** What is the "law of Christ" (Gal 6:2), the "law of the Spirit of life" (Rom 8:2), and the "law of liberty" (Jas 1:25)?

**Summary:** All "law of ___" phrases in the NT, when their content is specified, identify that content as the moral law (Decalogue) and/or the love command from Lev 19:18. James 2:11 identifies the 6th and 7th Decalogue commands as content of the "law of liberty." Paul distinguishes circumcision (ceremonial, dismissed) from "commandments of God" (affirmed, 1 Cor 7:19). The "new commandment" is explicitly "from the beginning" (1 Jn 2:7; 2 Jn 1:5). 13 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items; 5 Continues N-items, 0 Abolished; I-items include 2 I-A Continues, 1 I-B resolved Moderate for Continues, and 3 I-D Abolished.

**Relevance to law-25:** Confirms the moral law (including the Sabbath as a Decalogue member) continues under the "law of Christ," "law of liberty," and "law of the Spirit of life" designations.

---

## law-24: Weekly Sabbath vs Ceremonial Sabbaths

**Question:** Does the Bible itself distinguish the weekly Sabbath from the annual ceremonial sabbaths?

**Summary:** The Leviticus 23 literary structure explicitly separates the weekly Sabbath (v. 3) from the annual feasts (vv. 4-37) using the millibad separation (v. 38). The vocabulary distribution is telling: shabbath shabbathon (sabbath of complete rest) is used for the weekly Sabbath in Lev 23:3, while shabbathon alone (without shabbath) is used for some ceremonial days. The Hebrew terminology consistently distinguishes the two categories. 5 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items.

**Relevance to law-25:** Directly establishes Criterion 4 (Lev 23:37-38 distinction) with detailed linguistic analysis.

---

## sabbath-moral-or-ceremonial (Prior Study)

**Question:** Is the 7th-day Sabbath a moral law or a ceremonial law?

**Summary:** The Sabbath passes every test for moral law and fails every criterion for ceremonial law. It was established at creation before sin (Gen 2:2-3), spoken by God's own voice as the Fourth Commandment (Exo 20:8-11), written by God's finger on stone (Exo 31:18), placed inside the Ark (1 Ki 8:9), made for all humanity (Mrk 2:27), designated as "a perpetual covenant" and "a sign for ever" (Exo 31:16-17), explicitly distinguished from ceremonial feast sabbaths (Lev 23:37-38), affirmed as remaining after the cross (Heb 4:9), and prophesied to continue in the new earth (Isa 66:22-23). The Sabbath was not "added because of transgressions" -- it existed before transgression. It is a memorial pointing backward to creation (zakar), not a shadow pointing forward (skia).

**Relevance to law-25:** This is the most directly related prior study. Law-25 re-examines the same question with the full evidence classification methodology.

---

## sabbath-shadow-or-memorial

**Question:** Is the Sabbath a type/shadow fulfilled in Christ, or a creation memorial that continues?

**Summary:** The Sabbath is a creation memorial, not a typological shadow. Three converging lines: (1) the memorial language -- zakar (H2142, Infinitive Absolute) in Exo 20:8 points backward to a completed past event; (2) the definition of skia (G4639) -- used theologically in Col 2:17, Heb 8:5, Heb 10:1, it always describes ceremonial elements pointing forward to Christ; the Sabbath fails all five shadow criteria; (3) Hebrews 3-4 affirms sabbatismos (sabbath-keeping) rather than abolishing the Sabbath. The "sabbath days" in Col 2:16 are identified as annual ceremonial feast-system sabbaths based on the heorte-neomenia-sabbaton triad (2 Ch 31:3; Eze 45:17; Hos 2:11), explicitly separated from the weekly Sabbath by Lev 23:37-38.

**Relevance to law-25:** Directly establishes Criterion 5 (Typological function) -- the Sabbath is NOT a shadow but a memorial. Also addresses Col 2:16 objection.

---

## sabbath-still-in-effect

**Question:** Is the 7th-day Sabbath still in effect and binding on Christians today?

**Summary:** Yes. The conclusion rests on the cumulative evidence chain from 8 prior studies. The Sabbath was established at creation for all humanity (Gen 2:2-3; Mrk 2:27), embedded in the moral law (Exo 20:8-11), affirmed as remaining after the cross (Heb 4:9, sabbatismos), kept by the apostles as settled custom (Acts 17:2; 16:13; 18:4), expected by Jesus to be observed decades after the cross (Mat 24:20), acknowledged as "the commandment" after the crucifixion (Luk 23:56), identified with God's end-time saints (Rev 14:12), and prophesied to continue in the new earth (Isa 66:22-23). The common objection texts (Col 2:16; Rom 14:5; Gal 4:10) all refer to ceremonial observances, not the Decalogue.

**Relevance to law-25:** Integrative study that assumes the moral classification of the Sabbath; provides the "so what" conclusion chain.

---

## lunar-sabbath-rebuttal

**Question:** Does the Bible support the "Lunar Sabbath" theory?

**Summary:** No. The lunar sabbath theory fails on six counts: (1) contradicts the 40-year manna cycle which ran continuously without monthly resets (Exo 16); (2) the 7-day week was established at creation three days before the moon existed (Gen 1-2); (3) Lev 23 explicitly separates the weekly sabbath from the festival calendar using millibad; (4) confuses moed (H4150, "appointed festival time") with shabbat (H7676, "sabbath"); (5) cannot account for the NT's fixed weekly terminology (paraskeue/prosabbaton/sabbaton); (6) has zero support from any biblical text or ancient Jewish source.

**Relevance to law-25:** Confirms the weekly Sabbath's identity as a continuous 7-day cycle rooted in creation, supporting the creation-origin criterion.

---

## knowledge-accountability-judgment

**Question:** How does God judge people based on knowledge and the Holy Spirit's role in revealing truth?

**Summary:** Scripture reveals a graduated accountability system where God judges people according to the light they have received. Universal revelation channels include the True Light (Christ, Jhn 1:9), conscience (Rom 2:14-15), creation witness (Rom 1:19-20), and the Holy Spirit's convicting work (Jhn 16:8-11). Acts 17:30 establishes the paradigm: God "overlooked" (huperhorao, G5237) the times of ignorance, but NOW commands ALL men EVERYWHERE to repent. The principle of graduated accountability means greater light brings greater responsibility (Luk 12:47-48; Mat 11:20-24).

**Relevance to law-25:** Addresses the accountability principle for Criterion 7 (Universal scope) -- how does the Sabbath apply to those who have not yet received full light about it?

---

## law-06: Hebrew Law Vocabulary

**Question:** What do torah, mitsvah, choq, mishpat, edut, piqqud, and chuqqah mean, and do they distinguish moral from ceremonial law?

**Summary:** The Hebrew law vocabulary consists of terms that describe the formal character of laws (instruction, command, decree, judgment, testimony) rather than their moral category (moral, ceremonial, civil). Torah means "instruction/direction" and functions as the broadest umbrella term. Mitsvah means "command." Choq/chuqqah means "enacted decree/statute." Mishpat means "judgment/case law/justice." Eduth/edah means "testimony/attestation" and has a unique association with the Decalogue through its compound form "ark of the testimony."

**Relevance to law-25:** Establishes that the Hebrew vocabulary distinguishes the Decalogue formally (through the eduth/testimony term) even though the broader terms can apply across categories.

---

## law-07: Law of Moses

**Question:** What does "the law of Moses" refer to -- moral, ceremonial, or both?

**Summary:** "The law of Moses" refers to the comprehensive body of Pentateuchal legislation -- not restricted to any single category. When specific content is identifiable, it spans ceremonial, civil/judicial, covenant curses, and literary/Pentateuch usage. OT bridging passages demonstrate that "law of Moses," "law of God," and "law of the LORD" are used interchangeably for the same body of literature, though the Decalogue is distinguished within that body by its unique delivery markers.

**Relevance to law-25:** Shows that phrase-level identifiers ("law of Moses") are not category-specific, reinforcing the need for content-level analysis to determine whether a specific law is moral or ceremonial.

---

## law-08: Abolished at the Cross

**Question:** Which specific laws were abolished at the cross and which remain?

**Summary:** The seven primary NT abolition passages (Col 2:14-17, Eph 2:15, Heb 7:12, Heb 9:10, Heb 10:1-9, 2 Cor 3:7-11, Gal 3:13) each identify something different as abolished -- and none of them explicitly names the Decalogue or the moral law as the thing abolished. The Greek vocabulary in each passage specifies the referent: cheirographon tois dogmasin (handwritten certificate of ordinances) in Col 2:14, "sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings" in Heb 10:5-9, "carnal ordinances" about "meats and drinks, and divers washings" in Heb 9:10.

**Relevance to law-25:** Directly relevant: if the Sabbath is moral law (Decalogue), none of the seven abolition passages applies to it. If ceremonial, Col 2:14-17 would apply.

---

## law-09: Old Covenant / New Covenant

**Question:** What is the Old Covenant and what is the New Covenant? What exactly is "old"?

**Summary:** The Old Covenant was the bilateral agreement at Sinai; the New Covenant writes the SAME law ("my torah"/"my laws") on hearts rather than stone, with Christ as mediator, His blood as ratification, the Spirit as enabling power, and complete forgiveness as the basis. The text explicitly identifies the law written on hearts as "my laws" (God's laws), not a new or different law. The "old" is the administration/arrangement (external stone, human effort), not the moral content.

**Relevance to law-25:** The new covenant writes the Decalogue (including the Sabbath) on hearts. This supports the Sabbath's moral-law status by showing it continues under new covenant administration.

---

## law-10: New Covenant and Law

**Question:** Does the new covenant abolish or establish the moral law?

**Summary:** The new covenant passages consistently describe God's pre-existing moral law being written on hearts by the Spirit. The possessive pronouns "MY law" (torati, Jer 31:33), "MY laws" (nomous mou, Heb 8:10; 10:16) identify the content as God's own law. The new covenant changes WHERE the law is located (stone to hearts), HOW obedience is achieved (human effort to Spirit-empowerment), and WHO mediates (Moses to Christ) -- not WHICH law applies.

**Relevance to law-25:** Confirms the Decalogue's continuation under the new covenant, which includes the Fourth Commandment.

---

## law-11: Written on Hearts

**Question:** What specific law is "my law" written on hearts in Jeremiah 31:33 / Hebrews 8:10 / 10:16?

**Summary:** Four convergent textual markers identify the law written on hearts as the moral law (Decalogue): (1) the berith-Decalogue equation (Deu 4:13: "his covenant" = "ten commandments"; Jer 31:33 writes "my law" on hearts in a "new covenant"); (2) the kathab/grapho verb connection (same verb for writing on stone and writing on hearts); (3) the possessive pronoun "MY law/laws"; (4) the context in Hebrews citing Jeremiah while affirming the Decalogue.

**Relevance to law-25:** The Sabbath, as the Fourth Commandment, is part of "my law" written on hearts in the new covenant.

---

## law-15: Acts 15 -- Jerusalem Council

**Question:** What did the Jerusalem Council decide about the law?

**Summary:** The council addressed whether Gentile believers must be circumcised and keep the law of Moses as a condition of salvation. The answer was NO -- Gentiles need not undergo proselyte conversion. Peter called this demand "a yoke which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear" (v.10), referring to the ceremonial system as a salvation mechanism. The four "necessary things" (v.28) are baseline moral requirements, not the sum total of Christian obligation. James' quotation of Amos 9:11-12 establishes Gentile inclusion without ceremonial conversion.

**Relevance to law-25:** The Jerusalem Council did not abolish the moral law or the Sabbath. The "yoke" was the ceremonial system as a prerequisite for salvation, not the Decalogue.

---

## law-16: Paul and Law in Romans

**Question:** What does Paul teach about the law in Romans?

**Summary:** Paul teaches that the moral law (identified with the Decalogue by direct quotation) is holy, just, good, and spiritual; that it defines sin, reveals God's character, and remains the standard of righteousness. The law cannot justify (3:20), but faith establishes rather than abolishes it (3:31). Believers are freed from the law's condemning power ("not under the law," 6:14) so that the Holy Spirit can fulfill the law's righteous requirement in them (8:4). Christ is the goal (telos) of the law for righteousness, not its termination.

**Relevance to law-25:** Paul's teaching establishes that the moral law continues in force under the new covenant, including the Sabbath as part of the Decalogue.

---

## law-17: Paul and Law in Galatians

**Question:** What is Paul arguing in Galatians regarding the law?

**Summary:** Paul's argument is directed against Judaizers who demanded Gentile circumcision and ceremonial compliance as a salvation requirement. No one is justified by "works of the law"; Christ redeemed believers from the CURSE of the law (3:13 -- not from the law itself). The law's custodial function (paidagogos, 3:24-25) was preparatory for Christ. Paul affirms the moral law: "all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (5:14). The "days, months, times, years" of Gal 4:10 refer to the ceremonial calendar, not the Decalogue Sabbath.

**Relevance to law-25:** Gal 4:9-10 is a common objection text. Paul's target is the ceremonial system, not the Decalogue. The Sabbath as moral law is not implicated.

---

## law-18: Hebrews 8-10

**Question:** What do Hebrews 8-10 teach about priesthood, covenant, and law?

**Summary:** Hebrews 8-10 argues that Christ's once-for-all sacrifice replaces the Levitical sacrificial system. The "shadow" is the sacrificial/ceremonial system (8:5; 9:9; 10:1 -- defined by "those sacrifices"), the "carnal ordinances" are "meats and drinks, and divers washings" (9:10), and "the first" taken away is "sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings" (10:5-9). The argument is bracketed by two quotations of Jeremiah 31:33-34 (8:8-12 and 10:16-17) which affirm the law's continuation ON HEARTS.

**Relevance to law-25:** The "shadow" in Hebrews is the ceremonial system, not the Decalogue. The Sabbath, as part of the Decalogue, is the law written on hearts, not the shadow abolished.

---

## law-19: 2 Corinthians 3

**Question:** Were the Ten Commandments "done away" in 2 Corinthians 3?

**Summary:** Paul describes a diakonia (ministry/administration), not a nomos (law), as what was done away. The comparison is between two ministrations (old glory vs. surpassing glory), not two laws. The substantivized participles "that which is done away" (to katargoumenon, neuter) and "that which remaineth" (to menon, neuter) are neuter, matching neither nomos (masculine) nor diakonia (feminine), pointing to the glory/system of administration rather than the law itself.

**Relevance to law-25:** A common objection text. Paul's argument is about the change of administration (glory of the old covenant system vs. glory of the new), not the abolition of the Decalogue's content. The Sabbath, as part of the Decalogue, is not what was "done away."

---

## law-20: NT Greek Law Vocabulary

**Question:** What do entole, nomos, dogma, cheirographon, and dikaioma reveal about law categories in the NT?

**Summary:** The Greek vocabulary maps to law categories: entole (G1785) is the primary term for Decalogue commandments (Jesus uses it to list specific Decalogue commands in Mat 19:17-19); dogma (G1378) is used for the ceremonial/civil ordinances abolished at the cross (Col 2:14; Eph 2:15); cheirographon (G5498) appears only in Col 2:14 for the specific document nailed to the cross; dikaioma (G1345) has the broadest range, used for both moral righteousness requirements and ceremonial ordinances. The vocabulary supports a moral/ceremonial distinction at the textual level.

**Relevance to law-25:** The Greek vocabulary confirms the Decalogue (entole) is distinguished from ceremonial ordinances (dogma/cheirographon) in the NT. The Sabbath as part of the entole group is moral, not ceremonial.

---

## law-21: NT Vocab -- Law Categories

**Question:** How does NT vocabulary distinguish moral, ceremonial, and civil law?

**Summary:** Systematic mapping of all NT Greek law terms to their identifiable referents shows that entole consistently maps to the Decalogue when Jesus or the apostles use it with identifiable content, while dogma maps to ceremonial/civil ordinances in abolition contexts. The vocabulary-to-content mapping constitutes a textual distinction between categories, reinforcing the moral/ceremonial framework.

**Relevance to law-25:** Provides the linguistic evidence that the NT itself distinguishes law categories, supporting the framework used to classify the Sabbath.

---

## law-22: James and the Law

**Question:** What does James teach about the law?

**Summary:** James employs five law designations found nowhere else in the NT: "the perfect law of liberty" (1:25), "the royal law" (2:8), "the law of liberty" (2:12), "one lawgiver" (4:12), and "doer of the law" (4:11). He identifies the law's content by quoting Lev 19:18 and Decalogue commands (Exo 20:13-14), and asserts the law's ongoing authority, indivisibility, and liberating character. The "perfect law of liberty" is the moral law experienced under new covenant conditions.

**Relevance to law-25:** James identifies the Decalogue (including the Sabbath by implication as part of the indivisible law) as the "perfect law of liberty" that continues to judge believers.
