## [H905](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h905/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- bad (separation/apart/beside)

**Transliteration:** bad
**Pronunciation:** bad
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**BLB Count:** 56
**KJV Occurrences:** 203 total, 43 unique translations
**Definition:** From [H909](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h909/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; properly, separation; by implication, a part of the body, branch of a tree, bar for carrying; figuratively, chief of a city; especially (with prepositional prefix) as an adverb, apart, only, besides.

### Translation Distribution (top entries)
| Count | % | Translation |

| (34 more unique translations) | | |

**Critical Note for Lev 23:38:** The compound preposition millibad (min + l + bad) in Leviticus 23:38 means "apart from/beside." Its fourfold repetition creates emphatic grammatical separation between the weekly "sabbaths of the LORD" and the feast offerings, gifts, vows, and freewill offerings described in vv. 4-37.

## [H2142](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2142/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- zakar (to remember)

**Transliteration:** zakar
**Pronunciation:** zaw-kar
**Part of Speech:** verb (v)
**BLB Count:** 233
**KJV Occurrences:** 279 total, 140 unique translations
**Definition:** A primitive root; properly, to mark (so as to be recognized), i.e. to remember; by implication, to mention; also as denominative from [H2145](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2145/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, to be male.

**Critical Note for Exo 20:8:** zakor (Qal Infinitive Absolute used as imperative) is the memorial verb. In Exodus 20:8, it points BACKWARD to creation: "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy." The temporal direction is retrospective -- commemorating what God already did (Gen 2:2-3). This is the opposite of a shadow, which points FORWARD.

## [H6944](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6944/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- qodesh (holiness/sacred)

## [G4521](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4521/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- sabbaton (sabbath)

**Part of Speech:** neuter noun (n)

## [G4520](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4520/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- sabbatismos (sabbath-keeping)

**Transliteration:** sabbatismos
**Pronunciation:** sab-bat-is-mos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**BLB Count:** 1
**KJV Occurrences:** 1 total, 1 unique translation
**Definition:** From a derivative of [G4521](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4521/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; a "sabbatism," i.e. (figuratively) the repose of Christianity (as a type of heaven).

### Translation Distribution
| Count | % | Translation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 100% | a rest |

**Critical Note:** Hapax legomenon -- occurs only in Hebrews 4:9. The -ismos suffix denotes the ACT or PRACTICE of something (cf. baptismos = act of baptizing, exorcismos = act of exorcizing). The KJV translates as "rest" but this obscures the distinction from katapausis (G2663, generic rest) used throughout the surrounding passage (Heb 4:1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11). The author deliberately switched from katapausis to sabbatismos in v.9, signaling a specific kind of rest: sabbath-keeping.

## [G4639](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4639/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- skia (shadow)

**Transliteration:** skia
**Pronunciation:** skee-ah
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**BLB Count:** 7
**KJV Occurrences:** 7 total, 3 unique translations
**Definition:** Apparently a primary word; "shade" or a shadow (literally or figuratively).

### Translation Distribution
| Count | % | Translation |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | 57.1% | shadow |
| 2 | 28.6% | a shadow |
| 1 | 14.3% | the shadow |

**Critical Note:** Used theologically in Col 2:17, Heb 8:5, and Heb 10:1. In every theological use, it describes CEREMONIAL elements that point FORWARD to Christ. The Sabbath is characterized by zakar (backward-pointing memorial), not skia (forward-pointing shadow). These are opposite temporal orientations.

## [G444](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g444/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- anthropos (man/human being)

**Transliteration:** anthropos
**Pronunciation:** anth-ro-pos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**BLB Count:** 559
**KJV Occurrences:** 487 total, 36 unique translations
**Definition:** From [G435](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g435/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} and ops (the countenance); man-faced, i.e. a human being.

### Translation Distribution (top entries)

| 45 | 9.2% | a man |
| 42 | 8.6% | of men |
| 14 | 2.9% | unto men |
| 7 | 1.4% | man's |
| (29 more unique translations) | | |

**Critical Note for Mrk 2:27:** ton anthropon (articular accusative) = "the man" used generically for the human race. Jesus says the Sabbath was made for "the man" (humanity), not merely for Israel. This establishes universal scope.

## [G1096](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1096/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- ginomai (to become/come into being)

**Transliteration:** ginomai
**Pronunciation:** ghin-om-ahee
**Part of Speech:** verb (v)
**BLB Count:** 678
**KJV Occurrences:** 629 total, 218 unique translations

| (209 more unique translations) | | |

**Critical Note for Mrk 2:27:** egeneto (Aorist Middle Indicative 3S) = "was made/came into being." The Sabbath came into being for mankind -- a creation event, not a Sinai institution.

## [G52](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g52/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- agnoia (ignorance)

**Transliteration:** agnoia

**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)

## [G5237](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5237/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- huperhorao (to overlook/wink at)

**Transliteration:** huperhorao
**Pronunciation:** hoop-er-i-do
**Part of Speech:** verb (v)
**BLB Count:** 1
**KJV Occurrences:** 1 total, 1 unique translation
**Definition:** From [G5228](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5228/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} and [G3708](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3708/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; to overlook, i.e. not punish.

### Translation Distribution
| Count | % | Translation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 100% | winked at |

**Critical Note:** Hapax legomenon (Acts 17:30 only). God "overlooked" (huperhorao) the times of ignorance (agnoia), but NOW commands all men everywhere to repent. This establishes the accountability principle: what was previously overlooked because of ignorance is now required upon revelation of truth.
