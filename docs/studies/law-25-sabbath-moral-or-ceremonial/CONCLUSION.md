## Summary Answer

The Bible provides seven categories of textual evidence bearing on whether the weekly Sabbath is moral or ceremonial law. (1) **Creation origin**: The Sabbath was instituted at creation (Gen 2:2-3) before sin, before Israel, before any ceremonial system; the Fourth Commandment grounds itself in creation (Exo 20:11); the ceremonial system was "added because of transgressions" (Gal 3:19). (2) **Decalogue membership**: The Sabbath is the Fourth Commandment, sharing all seven unique Decalogue markers -- God's voice (Exo 20:1), God's finger (Exo 31:18), stone (Deu 4:13), inside the Ark (1 Ki 8:9), "he added no more" (Deu 5:22), "the covenant" (Deu 4:13), "the testimony" (Exo 31:18). (3) **Delivery mode**: The Decalogue including the Sabbath was spoken directly by God and written by God's finger; the ceremonial laws came through Moses as mediator (Lev 1:1; Deu 31:9). (4) **Lev 23:37-38**: The text explicitly separates the annual feasts from "the sabbaths of the LORD" using the preposition millibad ("beside/apart from"). The weekly Sabbath is never called moed or chag. (5) **Typological function**: The Sabbath uses zakar ("remember") pointing backward to creation; the ceremonial system uses skia ("shadow") pointing forward to Christ. (6) **Heb 4:9**: The author switches from katapausis (rest, 8 times) to sabbatismos (Sabbath-keeping, hapax legomenon) with a present-tense verb: "There remaineth [apoleipetai] a sabbatismos for the people of God." (7) **Universal scope**: The Sabbath was "made for man" (anthropos, generic humanity; egeneto, Aorist creation event -- Mrk 2:27). Isaiah 56:1-8 extends Sabbath blessings to foreigners. Isaiah 66:23 extends Sabbath worship to "all flesh" in the new earth. The accountability principle (Acts 17:30; Jas 4:17; Jhn 9:41; Luk 12:47-48) establishes that knowledge of moral obligation increases accountability. Across all seven criteria, the weekly Sabbath aligns with every marker of the moral law and none of the markers of the ceremonial law.

## Evidence Classification

### 1. Explicit Statements Table

Each E-item has been processed through Tree 1 (Tier Classification) and Tree 3 (E-Item Positional Classification).

Items already in the master evidence database are noted with their master IDs. New items use the next available IDs (E489+).

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Position | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | God rested (shabath, H7673), blessed (barakh), and sanctified (qadash) the seventh day at creation -- three divine actions before sin, before Israel, before any ceremonial system. | Gen 2:2-3 | Neutral | E063 (exists) |
| E2 | "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy... For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth...and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it." The Fourth Commandment explicitly grounds itself in creation with a causal "wherefore" (al-ken). | Exo 20:8-11 | Continues | E086 (exists) |
| E3 | "And God spake all these words, saying..." introduces the Decalogue (including the Fourth Commandment). God spoke the Sabbath command directly, not through Moses. | Exo 20:1 | Neutral | E001 (exists) |
| E4 | "These words the LORD spake...with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone." The Sabbath commandment is within the "he added no more" boundary. | Deu 5:22 | Neutral | E004 (exists) |
| E5 | "He declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone." The Sabbath is part of "his covenant, even ten commandments." | Deu 4:13 | Neutral | E005 (exists) |
| E6 | "Two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God." The Sabbath commandment was written by God's finger on stone. | Exo 31:18 | Neutral | E003 (exists) |
| E7 | "There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone." The Sabbath commandment, as part of the Decalogue, was stored inside the Ark. | 1 Ki 8:9 | Neutral | E008 (exists) |
| E8 | "And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments." Deu 4:14 immediately follows 4:13 (the ten commandments on stone), using a different delivery formula: "commanded me" (Moses as mediator). | Deu 4:13-14 | Neutral | E101 (exists) |
| E9 | "These are the feasts of the LORD... Beside [millibad] the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings." The fourfold millibad grammatically separates the weekly sabbaths from the feasts. | Lev 23:37-38 | Continues | E127 (exists) |
| E10 | The weekly Sabbath is listed in Lev 23:3 before the feasts; v.4 restarts with "These are the feasts of the LORD" -- the same formula as v.2, applied to the annual feasts beginning at v.5. | Lev 23:3-4 | Continues | E126 (exists) |
| E11 | Numbers 28-29 organizes offerings by temporal frequency: daily (28:1-8), Sabbath (28:9-10), new moon (28:11-15), annual feasts (28:16-29:38). The Sabbath has its own offering category, separate from annual feast offerings. | Num 28:9-10 | Continues | E482 (exists) |
| E12 | The weekly Sabbath (Lev 23:3) and Day of Atonement (Lev 23:28, 31) prohibit "all work" (kol-melakhah). The other feast days (Lev 23:7, 8, 21, 25, 35, 36) prohibit "servile work" (melekhet abodah). Two distinct work-prohibition levels. | Lev 23:3, 7, 8, 21, 25, 28, 31, 35, 36 | Continues | E481 (exists) |
| E13 | The weekly Sabbath is never called moed (H4150, appointed feast/time) in Leviticus 23 or elsewhere in the OT. The word moed is used in Lev 23:2, 4, 37, 44 for the annual feasts. | Lev 23 | Neutral | E487 (exists) |
| E14 | The weekly Sabbath is never called chag (H2282, festival/pilgrimage feast). The word chag is used for the three pilgrimage feasts (Exo 23:14-17). | Lev 23; Exo 23:14-17 | Neutral | E488 (exists) |
| E15 | "The sabbath was made [egeneto, G1096, Aorist Middle Indicative] for man [anthropon, G444], and not man for the sabbath." Egeneto points to a specific past event (creation); anthropon is generic humanity. | Mrk 2:27 | Neutral | E326 (exists) |
| E16 | "There remaineth therefore a rest [sabbatismos, G4520] to the people of God." Apoleipetai (Present Passive Indicative) = "is currently remaining." Sabbatismos is a hapax legomenon with the -ismos suffix denoting practice/observance. The author switches from katapausis (8x in Heb 3-4) to sabbatismos once in v.9. | Heb 4:9 | Continues | E337 (exists) |
| E17 | "For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works." Heb 4:4 quotes Gen 2:2, grounding the Heb 4:9 sabbatismos in the creation Sabbath. | Heb 4:4 | Neutral | E088 (exists) |
| E18 | "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday [heortes], or of the new moon [neomenias], or of the sabbath days [sabbaton]: which are a shadow [skia] of things to come." The triad heorte-neomenia-sabbaton matches the OT ceremonial triad pattern (2 Chr 31:3; Eze 45:17; Hos 2:11). | Col 2:16-17 | Neutral | E055 (exists) |
| E19 | The OT ceremonial triad "feasts/new moons/sabbaths" appears in 2 Chr 31:3, Eze 45:17, and Hos 2:11. In every OT occurrence, this triad describes the annual festival system offerings/celebrations. | 2 Chr 31:3; Eze 45:17; Hos 2:11 | Neutral | E486 (exists) |
| E20 | "It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed." The Sabbath is called "a sign...for ever" with its rationale in creation. | Exo 31:17 | Continues | E489 (new) |
| E21 | "Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; even them will I bring to my holy mountain." Isaiah extends Sabbath blessings to non-Israelites. | Isa 56:6-7 | Continues | E095 (exists) |
| E22 | "Blessed is the man [enosh] that doeth this...that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil." The Sabbath is paired with general moral conduct ("doing any evil") using the generic term for humanity (enosh). | Isa 56:2 | Continues | E490 (new) |
| E23 | "The Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him." God will gather others (beyond Israel) into the same covenant community that keeps the Sabbath (vv.4-7). | Isa 56:8 | Continues | E491 (new) |
| E24 | "From one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD." Sabbath worship extends to "all flesh" in the new earth. | Isa 66:22-23 | Continues | E096 (exists) |
| E25 | The women "rested the sabbath day according to the commandment" -- after the crucifixion. Luke calls the Sabbath "the commandment" (kata ten entolen) in a post-crucifixion context. | Luk 23:56 | Continues | E333 (exists) |
| E26 | Jesus instructs: "Pray ye that your flight be not...on the sabbath day" in a prophecy about AD 70 -- approximately 40 years after the crucifixion. | Mat 24:20 | Continues | E334 (exists) |
| E27 | Isaiah 58:13 states God's standard for Sabbath observance: "If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable." God calls the Sabbath "my holy day." | Isa 58:13 | Continues | E335 (exists) |
| E28 | "The times of this ignorance God winked at [hupereidon, G5237]; but now commandeth all men every where to repent [metanoein]." Hupereidon (hapax legomenon) = overlook. The transition "but now" marks the shift from forbearance to universal command. | Acts 17:30 | Neutral | E501 (new) |
| E29 | "To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin." Knowledge of good creates obligation; failure to act constitutes sin. | Jas 4:17 | Neutral | E492 (new) |
| E30 | "If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth." Claiming knowledge increases accountability. | Jhn 9:41 | Neutral | E493 (new) |
| E31 | "That servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself...shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not...shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required." Judgment is proportional to knowledge. | Luk 12:47-48 | Neutral | E494 (new) |
| E32 | "I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief." Paul received mercy because his persecution was done in ignorance. | 1 Tim 1:13 | Neutral | E495 (new) |
| E33 | "It had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them." Knowledge of righteousness increases accountability. | 2 Pet 2:20-21 | Neutral | E496 (new) |
| E34 | "If we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge [epignosis] of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins." Willful sin after full knowledge removes the sacrifice provision. | Heb 10:26 | Neutral | E497 (new) |
| E35 | "How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?" (Exo 16:28). God treats the Sabbath as an existing obligation before Sinai, referencing "my commandments and my laws" when the people failed to observe the Sabbath rest in the manna episode. | Exo 16:28 | Neutral | E498 (new) |
| E36 | "Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven...And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant." Nehemiah's retrospective distinguishes God's direct speech (the Sabbath) from mediated commands ("by the hand of Moses"). | Neh 9:13-14 | Continues | E106 (exists) |
| E37 | "Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them." God calls them "my sabbaths" and designates them as "a sign." | Eze 20:12 | Neutral | E097 (exists) |

| E39 | "One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind." The text does not name the Sabbath. The context addresses "doubtful disputations" (v.1) about eating and days. | Rom 14:5 | Neutral | E499 (new) |
| E40 | Gentile believers at Antioch requested Paul preach "the next sabbath" and "the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God." | Acts 13:42, 44 | Continues | E339 (exists) |
| E41 | "Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant." Exo 31:16 designates the Sabbath as a "perpetual covenant" (berit olam). | Exo 31:16 | Continues | E500 (new) |

### Tree 3 Positional Traces (Summary)

**Continues items (E2, E9, E10, E11, E12, E16, E20, E21, E22, E23, E24, E25, E26, E27, E36, E40, E41):**

All Continues items pass the four-gate validation:
- **Gate 1 (Referent):** Each verse identifies its subject. E2: the fourth commandment. E9/E10/E11/E12: the weekly Sabbath in Lev 23 and Num 28. E16: sabbatismos. E20: Sabbath sign grounded in creation. E21-E24: Sabbath in Isaiah. E25-E26: post-crucifixion Sabbath. E27: God's holy day. E36: Nehemiah's "thy holy sabbath." E40: Gentile Sabbath attendance. E41: perpetual Sabbath covenant.
- **Gate 2 (Grammar):** Grammar is unambiguous in each case.
- **Gate 3 (Genre):** All are didactic, legal, prophetic direct speech, or narrative report.
- **Gate 4 (Harmony):** Consistent with one another and with all other E-items in the evidence database.

**Neutral items (E1, E3-E8, E13-E15, E17-E19, E28-E35, E37-E39):**

These are factual observations both sides acknowledge: creation facts (E1, E17), Decalogue delivery facts (E3-E8), vocabulary facts (E13-E14, E19), grammatical data (E15), OT patterns (E37), accountability texts (E28-E35), and passages with ambiguous referents (E18, E38, E39). V1 and V2 both NO -> Neutral.

**E18 (Col 2:16-17) -- Neutral:** The text mentions "sabbath days" as "a shadow." The word sabbaton has a semantic range including both weekly and ceremonial sabbaths. The verse itself does not specify which. Gate 1 fails (referent ambiguous). Reclassification: the text says "sabbath days...a shadow"; which sabbaths is unspecified. -> Neutral.

**E38 (Gal 4:9-10) -- Neutral:** The text says "ye observe days." It does not name the Sabbath. The referent is unspecified. -> Neutral.

**E39 (Rom 14:5) -- Neutral:** The text says "one man esteemeth one day above another." It does not name the Sabbath. The referent is unspecified. -> Neutral.

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

Each N-item has been processed through Tree 1 (N-CHECK), Tree 4 (Gate 0), and Tree 3.

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Why Unavoidable | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The Fourth Commandment (Exo 20:8-11) explicitly grounds the Sabbath in the creation event, not in the ceremonial system or any national covenant. | E1 (Gen 2:2-3), E2 (Exo 20:8-11) | Neutral | The text of Exo 20:11 says "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth...and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day." The rationale cited is creation. Both sides acknowledge this is what the text says. | N010 (exists) |
| N2 | Leviticus 23:37-38 places the annual feasts "beside" (separate from) the "sabbaths of the LORD." The text itself draws a distinction between feast-day sabbaths and weekly sabbaths. | E9 (Lev 23:37-38), E10 (Lev 23:3-4) | Continues | The preposition millibad means "apart from/beside." It appears four times in v.38, each marking a separate category. No reader can deny that millibad creates a grammatical separation. | N021 (exists) |
| N3 | The Sabbath shares all seven unique Decalogue markers: God's voice (E3), God's finger (E6), stone (E5), inside the Ark (E7), "he added no more" (E4), "the covenant" (E5), "the testimony" (E6). No ceremonial law shares any of these markers. | E3, E4, E5, E6, E7 | Continues | Each marker is individually observable. The Sabbath is the Fourth Commandment of the Decalogue. Both sides acknowledge the Sabbath is in the Decalogue. The seven markers were individually established and verified in prior studies (law-01, law-03). | N120 (new) |
| N4 | The pre-Sinai manna episode (Exo 16:4-5, 22-30) demonstrates the Sabbath operating as an existing obligation before the Sinai legislation. God asks "How long refuse ye to keep my commandments?" (v.28) about Sabbath violation. | E35 (Exo 16:28), E2 (Exo 20:8-11) | Continues | The manna episode precedes the Sinai theophany (Exo 19-20) in the biblical narrative. God's rebuke presupposes an existing obligation. Both sides acknowledge the narrative sequence. | N121 (new) |
| N5 | The text of Mark 2:27 uses anthropos (generic humanity, not an ethnic term) and egeneto (Aorist, pointing to a creation event). The grammatical forms indicate the Sabbath was made at creation for mankind generically. | E15 (Mrk 2:27) | Neutral | These are grammatical facts: anthropos is generic, and the Aorist points to a specific past event. Both sides acknowledge the Greek parsing. The SIGNIFICANCE of these facts for the debate is inference-level, but the grammatical observations themselves are unavoidable. | N122 (new) |
| N6 | The texts of Acts 17:30, Jas 4:17, Jhn 9:41, Luk 12:47-48, 1 Tim 1:13, 2 Pet 2:20-21, and Heb 10:26, taken together, establish a graduated accountability principle: (a) ignorance provides forbearance, (b) knowledge creates obligation, (c) willful rejection after full knowledge carries the severest accountability. | E28, E29, E30, E31, E32, E33, E34 | Neutral | Each text individually states one facet of the principle. Together they form a graduated scale. Both positions accept the general accountability principle. It is neutral because both sides agree knowledge increases obligation -- the disagreement is about WHAT constitutes obligatory knowledge regarding the Sabbath. | N123 (new) |
| N7 | Hebrews 4:9 uses sabbatismos (G4520, -ismos suffix = practice of Sabbath-keeping) rather than katapausis (G2663, rest, used 8 times in Heb 3-4). The author made a deliberate vocabulary switch at v.9. | E16 (Heb 4:9), E17 (Heb 4:4) | Neutral | The word switch is an observable lexical fact. Both sides acknowledge katapausis is used 8 times and sabbatismos once. The -ismos suffix denoting practice is a Greek morphological fact. What sabbatismos denotes (literal or spiritual) is debated at the inference level. | N124 (new) |
| N8 | Isaiah 56:1-8 explicitly extends Sabbath blessings to non-Israelites ("sons of the stranger") who join themselves to the LORD. The text pairs Sabbath-keeping with moral conduct ("keepeth his hand from doing any evil") and with God's covenant. | E21 (Isa 56:6-7), E22 (Isa 56:2), E23 (Isa 56:8) | Continues | The text states that foreigners who keep the Sabbath receive access to God's holy mountain. Both sides acknowledge this is what Isaiah says. The Sabbath's extension to non-Israelites is explicitly stated. | N125 (new) |

### Positional Classification of N-Items

**N1 (Neutral):** Both sides acknowledge the Fourth Commandment cites creation. The positional significance (whether creation grounding makes the Sabbath permanent) is inference-level.

**N2 (Continues):** The millibad separation is evidence that the Bible itself distinguishes the weekly Sabbath from ceremonial feast sabbaths. This supports the Continues position's claim that the Bible makes law-category distinctions.

**N3 (Continues):** The Sabbath sharing all seven Decalogue markers is evidence that the Bible treats the Sabbath as part of the moral law. This supports the Continues position.

**N4 (Continues):** The pre-Sinai Sabbath obligation is evidence that the Sabbath predates the ceremonial system codified at Sinai. This supports the Continues position.

**N5 (Neutral):** The grammatical observations are neutral facts. Both sides acknowledge them.

**N6 (Neutral):** The accountability principle is accepted by both positions. Its specific application to the Sabbath requires inference.

**N7 (Neutral):** The word switch is observable. Its significance is debated.

**N8 (Continues):** Isaiah's extension of the Sabbath to foreigners is evidence that the Sabbath has universal scope, not merely ceremonial/national scope. This supports the Continues position.

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria | Master ID |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|---|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that the weekly Sabbath is a moral-law institution, not a ceremonial one, because it passes all seven moral-law criteria (creation origin, Decalogue membership, delivery mode, Lev 23 separation, memorial function, sabbatismos, universal scope) and fails all ceremonial criteria. | I-A | E1/E2 (creation origin: Gen 2:2-3, Exo 20:11); E3-E7 (Decalogue markers: God's voice, finger, stone, inside Ark, "he added no more"); E9/E10/E127 (Lev 23:37-38 millibad separation); E15/E326 (Mrk 2:27: "made for man"); E16/E337 (Heb 4:9: sabbatismos remains); E21/E095 (Isa 56:6-7: foreigners and Sabbath); E24/E096 (Isa 66:23: "all flesh"); N2/N021 (textual distinction feast/weekly); N3/N120 (seven Decalogue markers); N4/N121 (pre-Sinai obligation). | Each E/N item addresses one criterion. The comprehensive claim that the Sabbath is moral rather than ceremonial systematizes all seven criteria into a single categorical classification. No single verse states "the Sabbath is moral law." The conclusion is reached by observing that the Sabbath aligns with every moral-law marker and none of the ceremonial markers. | #5 (systematizing multiple E/N items into a comprehensive position) | I140 (new) |
| I2 | The "sabbath days" in Col 2:16 (described as "a shadow of things to come") refers to the annual ceremonial sabbaths, not the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue. | I-B | FOR: E9/E127 (Lev 23:38 millibad separation); E19/E486 (OT ceremonial triad: feasts/new moons/sabbaths); E18/E055 (Col 2:16 uses the same triad); N2/N021 (textual distinction). AGAINST: E18/E055 (sabbaton in Col 2:16 can refer to the weekly Sabbath in other NT contexts; the plural genitive sabbaton does not by itself specify which sabbaths). | The text of Col 2:16 uses sabbaton without specifying which sabbaths. The identification as ceremonial sabbaths requires importing the Lev 23:37-38 distinction and the OT triad pattern. The identification as the weekly Sabbath requires treating the ceremonial triad as inclusive of the Decalogue Sabbath. Both readings require interpretive judgment. | #2 (choosing between readings), #4b (cross-referencing OT triad pattern) | I023 (exists) |
| I3 | Col 2:16's "sabbath days" includes the weekly Sabbath, classifying it as "a shadow of things to come" that was fulfilled in Christ. | I-B | FOR: E18/E055 (sabbaton can mean the weekly Sabbath in NT usage); the annual-monthly-weekly sequence (holyday-new moon-sabbaths) could descend from yearly to weekly. AGAINST: E9/E127 (Lev 23:38 separates weekly sabbaths from feasts); E19/E486 (OT triad = ceremonial); E2/E086 (Fourth Commandment grounds Sabbath in creation, not typology); E20 (Exo 31:17: Sabbath is "a sign for ever" grounded in creation); N2/N021 (textual separation); N3/N120 (seven Decalogue markers); the Sabbath uses zakar (memorial, backward) not skia (shadow, forward). | Same as I2 in reverse direction. The text does not specify which sabbaths. This reading requires Col 2:16 to override the millibad separation, the creation grounding, the memorial function, and the Decalogue membership of the weekly Sabbath. | #2 (choosing between readings); overrides E9, E2, E20 | I141 (new) |
| I4 | The "days" in Galatians 4:10 include the weekly Sabbath, making it a "weak and beggarly element." | I-B | FOR: "Days" could include any recurring day observance. AGAINST: E38/E417 (the text does not name the Sabbath); the context addresses circumcision (Gal 5:2-6; 6:12-13) and the ceremonial system as soteriological requirement; "months, times, years" align with new moons, feast seasons, sabbatical/jubilee years -- all ceremonial calendar items. | The text says "days" without specifying which. Identifying the Sabbath as one of these "days" requires adding a referent the text does not state. | #1 (adding a concept: identifying "days" as the Sabbath when the text does not); #4b (cross-referencing) | I142 (new) |
| I5 | The "day" in Romans 14:5 includes the weekly Sabbath, making it a matter of individual conscience. | I-B | FOR: "One man esteemeth one day above another" could include any day. AGAINST: E39/E499 (the text does not name the Sabbath); the context is "doubtful disputations" (v.1) about food and days, linking to ceremonial fast/feast days; Paul elsewhere teaches that the moral law defines sin (Rom 3:31; 7:7, 12); the Sabbath has Decalogue status (E2-E7), which Paul never classifies as a "doubtful disputation." | The text says "one day" without specifying which. Identifying the Sabbath requires adding a referent the text does not state. The context of "doubtful disputations" suggests minor ceremonial questions, not Decalogue commandments. | #1 (adding a concept: identifying the "day" as the Sabbath when the text does not); #4b (cross-referencing) | I143 (new) |
| I6 | The Bible teaches that ALL sabbaths (including the weekly Sabbath) are part of one unified ceremonial system abolished at the cross. The moral/ceremonial distinction is a human invention with no biblical warrant. | I-D | E18/E055 (Col 2:16: sabbaton + skia). E417 (Gal 4:10: "days"). OVERRIDES: E9/E127 (Lev 23:38 millibad separation); E2/E086 (creation grounding); E3-E7 (Decalogue markers); E12/E481 (distinct work prohibitions); E16/E337 (sabbatismos remains); E21/E095 (foreigners keep Sabbath); E24/E096 ("all flesh" in new earth); N2/N021 (textual separation); N3/N120 (seven Decalogue markers); N4/N121 (pre-Sinai obligation). | Requires overriding: (a) the millibad separation (E9/N2); (b) the creation grounding (E1-E2); (c) the Decalogue membership with all seven markers (N3); (d) the pre-Sinai obligation (N4); (e) sabbatismos "remaining" (E16); (f) the universal scope (E21-E24); (g) the memorial function (zakar) vs. shadow function (skia). The claim that all law is one indivisible unit requires treating these textual distinctions as insignificant. | #1 (adding "all sabbaths are one" when the text distinguishes them); #3 (applying external framework of law-as-single-unit); overrides multiple E/N items | I144 (new) |
| I7 | The graduated accountability principle (Acts 17:30; Jas 4:17; Jhn 9:41; Luk 12:47-48) applies specifically to the Sabbath: as knowledge of the Sabbath's moral-law status increases, accountability for Sabbath observance increases. | I-A | E28-E34 (accountability texts); N6/N123 (graduated accountability principle); I1/I140 (Sabbath as moral law). | Each component is in the E/N/I tables. The general principle is established. The Sabbath's moral-law status is established by I1. The application of the general principle to the specific case of the Sabbath requires combining these two conclusions. | #5 (systematizing the general accountability principle with the specific Sabbath evidence) | I145 (new) |
| I8 | The sabbatismos in Hebrews 4:9 refers to literal, weekly Sabbath-keeping that remains for God's people, grounded in the creation Sabbath (Heb 4:4 quotes Gen 2:2). | I-A | E16/E337 (sabbatismos, -ismos suffix = practice); E17/E088 (Heb 4:4 quotes Gen 2:2); N7/N124 (deliberate word switch from katapausis); E1/E063 (Gen 2:2-3 creation Sabbath). | All components are text-derived. The -ismos suffix meaning "practice" is Greek morphology. The creation grounding is explicit. The word switch is observable. The claim systematizes these into a specific identification (literal Sabbath-keeping). | #5 (systematizing) | I146 (new) |
| I9 | The sabbatismos in Hebrews 4:9 refers to spiritual rest in Christ, using the Sabbath as an illustration, not commanding literal Sabbath observance. | I-B | FOR: Heb 4:10 says "he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his" -- "rest" language could be spiritual. The broader Heb 3-4 argument is about entering God's rest through faith. AGAINST: E16/E337 (sabbatismos = Sabbath-keeping, not generic rest); N7/N124 (deliberate word switch -- if spiritual rest were meant, katapausis was available); E17/E088 (creation grounding); E2/E086 (Fourth Commandment grounds Sabbath in creation -- the same creation event Heb 4 references). | The text uses a word (sabbatismos) that lexically means "Sabbath-keeping." Reading it as "spiritual rest" requires choosing a meaning other than the word's lexical value. The word switch from katapausis to sabbatismos would be inexplicable if both meant the same thing. | #2 (choosing a meaning for sabbatismos other than its lexical value); conflicts with E16/N7 | I147 (new) |

### I-B Resolution: I2/I3 -- Referent of "sabbath days" in Col 2:16

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR ceremonial sabbaths (I2): E9/E127 (Lev 23:38 millibad separation), E19/E486 (OT triad = ceremonial), N2/N021 (textual distinction)
- FOR weekly Sabbath (I3): E18/E055 (sabbaton has broad NT semantic range)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E9/E127 (Lev 23:38) | Plain | Directly addresses weekly vs. feast sabbaths with explicit separating preposition. Legal prose. |
| E19/E486 (OT triad) | Contextually Clear | The triad appears consistently in ceremonial contexts. Requires pattern recognition. |
| E18/E055 (Col 2:16) | Ambiguous | The word sabbaton can refer to either weekly or annual sabbaths. The verse does not specify. |
| N2/N021 (millibad) | Plain | Follows directly from Lev 23:38. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR ceremonial (I2): Two Plain items (E9/N2), one Contextually Clear (E19). Additionally, E2/E086 (creation grounding), N3/N120 (Decalogue markers), and the zakar/skia directional contrast all weigh against the weekly Sabbath being a "shadow."
FOR weekly (I3): One Ambiguous item (E18 -- sabbaton's semantic range).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements (Lev 23:38 separating weekly sabbaths from feasts; millibad preposition) and the Contextually Clear pattern (OT ceremonial triad) determine the reading of the Ambiguous item (sabbaton in Col 2:16). The creation grounding (Exo 20:11), memorial function (zakar), and Decalogue membership further support reading Col 2:16 sabbaths as ceremonial. The clear interprets the unclear.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong toward I2 (ceremonial sabbaths).**
Plain statements on one side (Lev 23:38 separation, millibad preposition), Contextually Clear on the same side (OT triad pattern), with only Ambiguous text on the opposing side (sabbaton's semantic range). Multiple additional E/N items (creation grounding, Decalogue markers, memorial function) further support the ceremonial reading. *(Examined in depth in law-08-abolished-at-cross and law-24-weekly-sabbath-vs-ceremonial-sabbaths.)*

### I-B Resolution: I4 -- Do the "days" in Galatians 4:10 include the weekly Sabbath?

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR including Sabbath: "Days" could conceivably include any recurring day.
- AGAINST: E38/E417 (text does not name the Sabbath); Galatians context addresses circumcision and the ceremonial system; "months, times, years" = new moons, feast seasons, sabbatical/jubilee years.

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E38/E417 (Gal 4:9-10) | Ambiguous | "Days" is unspecified. Could include any day. |
| Gal 5:2-6; 6:12-13 (circumcision context) | Contextually Clear | The Galatians controversy is about circumcision and law-keeping as soteriological requirement. |
| E2/E086 (Sabbath in Decalogue) | Plain | The Sabbath is explicitly a Decalogue commandment. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR including Sabbath: One Ambiguous item ("days" unspecified). AGAINST: The Contextually Clear context identifies the controversy as circumcision/ceremonial, and the Plain Decalogue status of the Sabbath makes it categorically different from the ceremonial items Paul lists.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The clear passages (Sabbath's Decalogue membership; Galatians' circumcision context) determine the reading of the ambiguous "days." Paul's own affirmation of the moral law (Rom 3:31; 7:7, 12) and his dismissal of circumcision while affirming commandments (1 Cor 7:19) further clarify.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate toward Continues (days = ceremonial, not Sabbath).**
The text does not name the Sabbath. The context is circumcision and the ceremonial system. The Sabbath's Decalogue status distinguishes it from the ceremonial items in view.

---

### I-B Resolution: I5 -- Does Romans 14:5 include the weekly Sabbath?

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR including Sabbath: "One day above another" could include any day.
- AGAINST: E39/E499 (text does not name the Sabbath); Rom 14:1 classifies the subject as "doubtful disputations"; the Decalogue is never treated as "doubtful."

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E39/E499 (Rom 14:5) | Ambiguous | "One day" is unspecified. |
| Rom 14:1 ("doubtful disputations") | Contextually Clear | The chapter's subject is minor questions of conscience. |
| E2/E086 (Sabbath in Decalogue) | Plain | The Sabbath is a Decalogue commandment. |
| Rom 3:31; 7:7, 12 (Paul's moral law affirmation) | Plain | Paul affirms the moral law in Romans. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR including Sabbath: One Ambiguous item. AGAINST: Multiple Plain and Contextually Clear items.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
Paul's own affirmations of the moral law in the same epistle (Rom 3:31: "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law"; Rom 7:7, 12: the law is identified as the Decalogue and called holy, just, and good) determine the reading of the ambiguous Rom 14:5. Paul would not classify a Decalogue commandment as a "doubtful disputation."

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate toward Continues (day = ceremonial fast/feast, not Sabbath).**
The text does not name the Sabbath. The classification as "doubtful disputations" is inconsistent with Decalogue status. Paul affirms the moral law repeatedly in Romans.

---

### I-B Resolution: I9 -- Does sabbatismos mean literal Sabbath-keeping or spiritual rest?

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR literal Sabbath-keeping: E16/E337 (sabbatismos = Sabbath-keeping by morphology); N7/N124 (deliberate word switch from katapausis); E17/E088 (creation grounding).
- FOR spiritual rest: The broader Heb 3-4 context discusses entering God's rest through faith; Heb 4:10 uses "rest" language that could be spiritual.

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E16/E337 (sabbatismos) | Contextually Clear | The -ismos suffix in Greek denotes practice. The word means "Sabbath-keeping." Requires Greek morphological awareness. |
| N7/N124 (word switch) | Plain | The switch from katapausis to sabbatismos is an observable fact. |
| E17/E088 (Heb 4:4 = Gen 2:2) | Plain | Explicit quotation of the creation Sabbath passage. |
| Heb 4:10 (spiritual rest language) | Ambiguous | Could refer to either spiritual rest or Sabbath cessation from work. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR literal: One Plain and two Contextually Clear items. FOR spiritual: One Ambiguous item.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The deliberate word switch (Plain) and the -ismos morphology (Contextually Clear) together indicate that the author intended something specific by sabbatismos that katapausis did not convey. The creation grounding (Heb 4:4 = Gen 2:2) connects sabbatismos to the creation Sabbath institution.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate toward literal Sabbath-keeping (I8).**
The text uses a specific word (sabbatismos) with a morphological meaning (practice of Sabbath-keeping), makes a deliberate switch from another available word (katapausis), and grounds the argument in the creation Sabbath. The spiritual-rest reading requires sabbatismos to mean the same as katapausis, which would make the word switch inexplicable.

## What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

### What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):

1. The Sabbath was instituted at creation: God rested, blessed, and sanctified the seventh day (Gen 2:2-3).
2. The Fourth Commandment explicitly grounds itself in creation (Exo 20:11).
3. The Sabbath is part of the Decalogue, sharing all seven unique markers (God's voice, finger, stone, inside Ark, "he added no more," "the covenant," "the testimony").
4. The delivery mode for the Decalogue (God's direct speech) differs from the delivery mode for the ceremonial laws (Moses as mediator).
5. Leviticus 23:37-38 explicitly separates the annual feasts from "the sabbaths of the LORD" using millibad ("beside/apart from").
6. The weekly Sabbath is never called moed or chag in the Pentateuch.
7. Numbers 28-29 gives the Sabbath its own offering category, distinct from the annual feast offerings.
8. The Sabbath uses memorial vocabulary (zakar, "remember") pointing backward to creation.
9. The ceremonial system uses shadow vocabulary (skia) pointing forward to Christ.
10. Hebrews 4:9 uses sabbatismos (Sabbath-keeping practice) with a present-tense verb ("is currently remaining"). The author switches from katapausis to sabbatismos at v.9.
11. Jesus states the Sabbath was "made for man" (anthropos, generic humanity; egeneto, Aorist = creation event).
12. Isaiah 56:1-8 extends Sabbath blessings to non-Israelites who join themselves to the LORD.
13. Isaiah 66:23 states "all flesh" will worship on the Sabbath in the new earth.
14. Post-crucifixion: the women rested "according to the commandment" (Luk 23:56); Jesus instructed prayer about Sabbath flight for AD 70 (Mat 24:20).
15. The accountability principle: ignorance receives forbearance (Acts 17:30); knowledge creates obligation (Jas 4:17; Jhn 9:41); willful rejection after knowledge carries severe accountability (Heb 10:26; 2 Pet 2:20-21).

### What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):

1. No verse explicitly says "the Sabbath is moral law" or "the Sabbath is ceremonial law" using those categories.
2. No verse explicitly states that Col 2:16's "sabbath days" refers to the weekly Sabbath.
3. No verse explicitly states that Col 2:16's "sabbath days" refers to the ceremonial sabbaths.
4. No verse explicitly states that the "days" in Gal 4:10 include the weekly Sabbath.
5. No verse explicitly states that the "day" in Rom 14:5 is the Sabbath.
6. No verse explicitly says "all law is one indivisible unit" or "there is no moral/ceremonial distinction."
7. No verse explicitly says "the accountability principle applies specifically to the Sabbath" (the principle is general; its Sabbath application is inferred).
8. No verse explicitly says "sabbatismos in Heb 4:9 means literal weekly Sabbath-keeping" -- the lexical meaning supports it, but the verse does not state "observe the seventh day."

## Positional Summary

Across all seven criteria tested in this study:

17 explicit statements support the Continues position (the Sabbath is moral law and remains binding). 0 explicit statements support the Abolished position (the Sabbath is ceremonial and was abolished). 24 explicit statements are Neutral.

4 necessary implications support Continues. 0 necessary implications support Abolished. 4 necessary implications are Neutral.

3 I-A inferences (evidence-extending) support Continues. 0 I-A inferences support Abolished.

5 I-B inferences (competing-evidence) were resolved: all 5 resolved toward the Continues direction (3 Strong, 2 Moderate). 0 resolved toward Abolished.

1 I-D inference (counter-evidence external) supports the Abolished position -- the claim that all sabbaths are one unified system abolished at the cross. This I-D inference requires overriding multiple E and N items (creation grounding, Decalogue markers, millibad separation, sabbatismos, universal scope).

The Abolished-position arguments in this study (Col 2:16, Gal 4:10, Rom 14:5) each cite passages where the referent is unspecified by the text itself. The identification of the weekly Sabbath as the referent is an inference (I-B or I-D) that requires adding a concept the passage does not contain. The Continues-position arguments cite passages where the referent is specified (the Fourth Commandment, the Lev 23 Sabbath, Isaiah's Sabbath for foreigners, Heb 4:9 sabbatismos) and where the textual markers (creation origin, Decalogue membership, millibad separation, memorial function, universal scope) are observable in the text.
