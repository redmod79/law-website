# What Is the Old Covenant and What Is the New Covenant?

## A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence

This study examines one of the most important questions in Bible study: What exactly changed between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant? Was it the law itself that became "old," or was it the arrangement surrounding the law? The Bible speaks directly and repeatedly to this question, and the answer emerges clearly from the texts themselves.

## The Old Covenant: What Was It?

The Old Covenant was the agreement God made with Israel at Mount Sinai. It had a clear structure: God proposed the relationship, the people accepted it, and it was sealed with blood. Moses tells us exactly what the covenant terms were:

> "And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone." (Deuteronomy 4:13)

> "And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments." (Exodus 34:28)

The covenant terms were the Ten Commandments, written by God's own finger on stone tablets. These tablets are called "the tables of the covenant" (Deuteronomy 9:9, 11). Notably, the very next verse after identifying the covenant as the Ten Commandments distinguishes them from other legislation:

> "And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land." (Deuteronomy 4:14)

So the covenant terms (the Ten Commandments) and the additional statutes and judgments were treated as related but distinct categories, identified in consecutive verses.

The people accepted this covenant based on their own promise:

> "All the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do." (Exodus 19:8)

And it was ratified with animal blood:

> "And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words." (Exodus 24:8)

## Where the Old Covenant Failed

The problem with the Old Covenant was never the law itself. The problem was with the people. God Himself said so:

> "O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!" (Deuteronomy 5:29)

> "Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day." (Deuteronomy 29:4)

The people lacked the internal capacity to keep the covenant they had agreed to. The book of Hebrews confirms exactly where the fault lay:

> "For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant..." (Hebrews 8:8)

The word "them" in the Greek text (autous) refers unmistakably to the people, not to the law. The fault was with them. The law was not deficient; the people were. Paul makes the same point:

> "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son..." (Romans 8:3)

The law's limitation was "through the flesh" -- through human weakness -- not through any defect in the law itself.

## The New Covenant Promise: Same Law, New Location

When God promised a new covenant through the prophet Jeremiah, He was remarkably specific about what would change and what would stay the same:

> "Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake..." (Jeremiah 31:31-32)

The new covenant would be "not according to" the old covenant arrangement -- the one the people broke. Then God specifies exactly what the new covenant involves:

> "But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people." (Jeremiah 31:33)

Notice the phrase "my law." In Hebrew this is "torati" -- God's own Torah, identified by the possessive pronoun "my." God does not say "a new law" or "a different law." He says "my law" -- the same law that was on stone, now written on hearts. The very same Hebrew verb for "write" (katab) is used for writing the commandments on stone and for writing them on hearts. The writing action is the same; the surface changes from stone to the human heart.

Ezekiel reveals the power behind this change:

> "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them." (Ezekiel 36:26-27)

The Spirit of God causes obedience to the same "statutes" and "judgments." No new set of commands is introduced. The Spirit enables what the flesh could not accomplish: faithful obedience to God's existing law.

## The New Testament Confirms This Pattern

The book of Hebrews quotes Jeremiah's new covenant promise twice, and both times preserves the possessive pronoun:

> "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people." (Hebrews 8:10)

> "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more." (Hebrews 10:16-17)

"My laws" -- God's own existing laws -- placed on hearts and minds. Paul states the same contrast:

> "Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart." (2 Corinthians 3:3)

The content of the writing is the same. What changes is the surface (stone becomes heart) and the agent (ink becomes the Spirit of the living God).

Paul also describes the result of this Spirit-empowered relationship with the law:

> "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." (Romans 8:4)

The Spirit does not cancel the law's righteousness; the Spirit fulfills it in believers. And Paul is direct when asked whether faith voids the law:

> "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." (Romans 3:31)

## Five Things That Changed Between Covenants

The biblical texts identify five specific differences between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant. None of them is a change in the law's content:

**1. The location of the law changed.** It moved from stone tablets to hearts and minds (Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:10; 2 Corinthians 3:3).

**2. The power behind obedience changed.** Instead of relying on human promise ("we will do"), the New Covenant rests on God's action ("I will put") and the Holy Spirit's enabling power (Ezekiel 36:27; Romans 8:4).

**3. The mediator changed.** Moses mediated the Old Covenant (Deuteronomy 5:5). Jesus Christ mediates the New Covenant:

> "But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises." (Hebrews 8:6)

**4. The ratifying blood changed.** Animal blood sealed the Old Covenant (Exodus 24:8). Christ's own blood seals the New:

> "For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins." (Matthew 26:28)

**5. Complete forgiveness was secured.** The New Covenant includes a promise the Old did not:

> "For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more." (Hebrews 8:12)

Every one of these five differences is a change in the covenant arrangement -- the administration surrounding the law. Not one of them is a change in the moral content of the law itself.

## What Hebrews Says Was "Vanishing"

Some readers point to Hebrews 8:13 -- "In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away" -- and conclude that the entire old covenant, including the Ten Commandments, was vanishing. But the same author, in the very next chapter, specifies what the first covenant practically consisted of:

> "Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary." (Hebrews 9:1)

> "Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation." (Hebrews 9:10)

The first covenant's practical elements were the sanctuary service, the sacrificial system, and the ceremonial washings -- described as "carnal ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation." These were temporary by design. And just two chapters later, Hebrews performs both operations in a single argument: it removes the sacrificial system and affirms the moral law written on hearts within the same passage (Hebrews 10:1-17). The sacrifices are "taken away" (verse 9), and then the author immediately quotes Jeremiah: "I will put my laws into their hearts" (verses 16-17). The removal of the ceremonial system and the continuation of the moral law are presented side by side, without any tension, by the same biblical writer.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

It is just as important to note what the Bible does not say about the covenant transition:

- **The Bible never says "the Ten Commandments are abolished in the new covenant."** No new covenant text makes this statement.

- **The Bible never says "the new covenant has a different set of moral commands."** Every new covenant passage says God will write "my law" or "my laws" -- His own pre-existing law -- on hearts.

- **The Bible never says the law itself was the problem.** Every passage that identifies the source of failure points to the people or the flesh, never to the law. Paul calls the law "holy, and just, and good" (Romans 7:12) and "spiritual" (Romans 7:14).

- **The Bible never says "the law of the new covenant is different from the law of the old covenant."** The possessive pronoun "my" in both Hebrew (torati) and Greek (nomous mou) identifies the new covenant law as God's own existing law.

- **The Bible never introduces a replacement moral code in any new covenant passage.** The law is consistently treated as the constant element; the covenant arrangement is the variable.

## Conclusion

The biblical evidence on this question is consistent and clear. The Old Covenant was the arrangement at Sinai: God proposed terms (the Ten Commandments), Israel accepted by human promise, and it was sealed with animal blood. The people broke that covenant because they lacked the heart to keep it. The New Covenant, promised through Jeremiah and fulfilled in Christ, writes the same law on hearts rather than stone. Christ replaces Moses as mediator, His blood replaces animal blood, the Holy Spirit replaces human effort, and complete forgiveness replaces the cycle of repeated sacrifice.

What is "old" is the covenant arrangement -- the priesthood, the sanctuary, the sacrificial blood, and the reliance on human promise. What endures is the moral law itself, now internalized by the Spirit. The Psalmist expressed this experience centuries before Jeremiah's prophecy:

> "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart." (Psalm 40:8)

And the New Testament saints carry it forward:

> "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous." (1 John 5:3)

> "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." (Revelation 14:12)

The difference between the covenants is not what God requires, but how He enables it. The law is the constant. The covenant is the variable. And in the New Covenant, what was once carved on stone is now written on the heart by the Spirit of the living God.
