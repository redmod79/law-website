# Verse Analysis

## Study Question
What is the Old Covenant and what is the New Covenant? What exactly is "old" -- the law itself, or the arrangement/administration? Is the difference the CONTENT of the law or the LOCATION/POWER/MEDIATOR/BASIS?

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### A. OLD COVENANT FORMATION

#### Exodus 19:3-8 (God's Proposal, Israel's Acceptance)
**Context:** God proposes a covenant relationship with Israel at Sinai after delivering them from Egypt. The bilateral structure: God offers terms, Israel must accept.
**Direct statement:** God says "if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me" (v.5). Israel responds: "All that the LORD hath spoken we will do" (v.8).
**Key observations:**
- The covenant is conditional on Israel's obedience ("if ye will obey")
- Israel's acceptance is unanimous and verbal ("all the people answered together")
- The covenant terms have not yet been stated at this point -- they come in Exodus 20
- The structure is bilateral: God proposes, the people consent
- The weakness of this arrangement becomes apparent: it rests on the people's promise ("we will do")
**Cross-references:** Heb 8:9 identifies this as the covenant "they continued not in" -- the people failed to keep their part. Deu 5:29 records God's lament: "O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always."

#### Exodus 20:1-17 (The Ten Commandments -- Covenant Terms)
**Context:** God speaks the Decalogue directly to the assembled people. "God spake all these words" (v.1). This is the content of the covenant proposed in Exodus 19.
**Direct statement:** The Ten Commandments are delivered by God's own voice. The people hear God speak.
**Key observations:**
- God speaks directly -- no mediator (v.1; confirmed by Deu 5:4, 22)
- The content is the Decalogue: ten moral commands concerning relationship with God and neighbor
- Deu 4:13 later identifies these as "his covenant, even ten commandments"
- Exo 34:28 calls them "the words of the covenant, the ten commandments"
- This establishes the covenant terms as specifically the Decalogue
**Cross-references:** When Jer 31:33 promises to write "my law" (torati) on hearts, and the covenant terms were the Ten Commandments, the object of the new covenant writing is identifiable.

#### Exodus 24:1-12 (Covenant Ratification by Blood)
**Context:** After the Decalogue and judgments are given, the covenant is formally ratified.
**Direct statement:** Moses tells the people "all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments" (v.3). The people respond: "All the words which the LORD hath said will we do" (v.3). Moses writes, builds an altar, offers sacrifices, sprinkles blood on altar and people, and says: "Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words" (v.8).
**Key observations:**
- The ratification involves blood -- ox blood sprinkled on people (v.8)
- The people's second affirmation: "All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient" (v.7)
- The "book of the covenant" is read (v.7) and blood is sprinkled (v.8)
- v.12: God promises "tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written"
- The old covenant's basis: animal blood and human promises
**Cross-references:** Heb 9:18-20 quotes this passage directly: "the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you." Mat 26:28: Jesus says "this is my blood of the new testament" -- paralleling the old ratification with a new one. The contrast: ox blood vs. Christ's blood.

#### Exodus 31:18 (Tables Written with Finger of God)
**Context:** After the tabernacle instructions, God gives Moses the physical covenant document.
**Direct statement:** "He gave unto Moses...two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God."
**Key observations:**
- The tablets are called "tables of testimony" (eduth) -- identified with the covenant
- Written by God's own finger -- divine authorship
- Stone medium -- permanence
- This is the physical embodiment of the covenant terms (the Decalogue)

#### Exodus 34:27-28 (Words of the Covenant = Ten Commandments)
**Context:** After the golden calf incident, God renews the covenant and rewrites the tablets.
**Direct statement:** "He wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments" (v.28).
**Key observations:**
- Explicit equation: "words of the covenant" = "the ten commandments"
- This is an unambiguous identification: the covenant's terms ARE the Decalogue
- The covenant was made "with thee and with Israel" (v.27)

#### Deuteronomy 4:13-14 (His Covenant = Ten Commandments)
**Context:** Moses' recapitulation of the Sinai events to the new generation.
**Direct statement:** "He declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments" (vv.13-14).
**Key observations:**
- "His covenant" = "ten commandments" -- explicit identification
- God wrote the Ten Commandments on stone (v.13)
- Separate: "the LORD commanded me [Moses]" to teach statutes and judgments (v.14)
- This verse itself distinguishes two categories: (1) God's covenant = Decalogue on stone, and (2) statutes/judgments taught by Moses
- The distinction is made in two consecutive verses

#### Deuteronomy 5:1-22, 29 (The Covenant at Horeb)
**Context:** Moses recounts the Sinai experience.
**Direct statement:** "The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb" (v.2). "The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount" (v.4). Moses then recites the Ten Commandments (vv.6-21). "These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly...with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone" (v.22).
**Key observations:**
- The covenant at Horeb = the Decalogue (vv.6-21)
- God spoke "face to face" -- direct communication
- "He added no more" -- the Decalogue was complete as spoken; subsequent legislation came through Moses
- v.29: God's own desire: "O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always." This lament anticipates the new covenant solution -- God Himself will provide the heart they lack.
**Cross-references:** Jer 31:33 answers Deu 5:29: what God wished for (a heart to keep His commandments), He promises to provide in the new covenant (writing the law on hearts).

#### Deuteronomy 9:9-11 (Tables of the Covenant)
**Context:** Moses recalls receiving the tablets.
**Direct statement:** "The tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you" (v.9). "The LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant" (v.11).
**Key observations:**
- "Tables of the covenant" = the stone tablets containing the Decalogue
- Confirms the covenant's physical terms were the Ten Commandments on stone

#### Deuteronomy 29:1, 4 (Words of the Covenant; Heart Lacking)
**Context:** A supplementary covenant in Moab, "beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb" (v.1).
**Direct statement:** "Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day" (v.4).
**Key observations:**
- The Moab covenant is distinct from and supplementary to the Horeb covenant
- v.4 identifies a fundamental deficiency: the people lack the heart to perceive
- This deficiency is what the new covenant addresses (Jer 31:33; Eze 36:26-27)

---

### B. NEW COVENANT PROPHECY AND PROMISE

#### Jeremiah 31:31-34 (The New Covenant Promise -- Central Text)
**Context:** Jeremiah prophesies during Judah's decline, promising a future restoration. This is the central OT passage on the new covenant.
**Direct statement:**
- v.31: "I will make (karath) a new covenant (berith chadashah) with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah"
- v.32: "Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers...which my covenant they brake"
- v.33: "I will put my law (torati) in their inward parts (b'qirbam), and write it in their hearts (libbam)"
- v.34: "They shall all know me...for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more"

**Key observations:**
1. **Hebrew parsing confirms "my law" (torati):** The word is torah (H8451) with first-person possessive suffix. Torah is the standard term for God's law throughout the OT. God says He will put "MY torah" -- His own law -- in their inward parts. The possessive suffix makes this God's existing law, not a new or different law.

2. **The verb "write" (ekhtabenah) from katab (H3789):** Qal Imperfect 1st singular with 3rd feminine singular suffix. The feminine suffix refers back to torah (feminine). God will "write IT" (the torah) on their hearts. The same verb katab is used for writing the Decalogue on stone (Exo 34:1; Deu 10:2,4). The writing action is the same; the surface changes from stone to heart.

3. **What is "not according to":** The new covenant is "not according to (lo ka-) the covenant that I made with their fathers." The difference is from the old COVENANT (berith), not from the old LAW (torah). The law content remains ("my torah"); the covenant arrangement changes.

4. **The fault identified:** "Which my covenant they brake (hepheru)" -- Hiphil of parar (H6565), "they broke." The problem was the people's breaking of the covenant, not any deficiency in the law content.

5. **Four elements of the new covenant:**
   - (a) Law internalized: "I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts"
   - (b) Covenant relationship: "I will be their God, and they shall be my people"
   - (c) Universal knowledge: "They shall all know me"
   - (d) Forgiveness: "I will forgive their iniquity and remember their sin no more"

6. **What changes between covenants:** The LOCATION of the law (stone -> heart), the POWER behind obedience (human promise -> God's action: "I will put"), and the BASIS for relationship (unforgiven sin -> forgiveness). The law itself (torati) is the constant.

**Cross-references:** Heb 8:8-12 and 10:16-17 quote this passage. Eze 36:26-27 provides the mechanism (the Spirit). Deu 5:29 supplies the precondition God wished for.

#### Ezekiel 11:19-20 (New Heart, Walk in Statutes)
**Context:** God promises restoration to the exiles.
**Direct statement:** "I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh: That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them" (vv.19-20).
**Key observations:**
- The PURPOSE of the new heart/spirit: "that they may walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances"
- The statutes (chuqqot) and ordinances (mishpatim) are PRE-EXISTING -- not new laws
- The change is in the HEART (stony -> flesh), not in the statutes
- "I will give" / "I will put" / "I will take" -- God performs the transformation

#### Ezekiel 36:24-28 (New Heart, Spirit Causes Obedience)
**Context:** God promises future restoration of Israel. Parallel to Eze 11:19-20 but with additional detail.
**Direct statement:** "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them" (vv.26-27).
**Key observations:**
- The Spirit is the agent: "I will put MY SPIRIT within you, and CAUSE you to walk in my statutes"
- The statutes (chuqqot) and judgments (mishpatim) are the SAME ones from the old covenant
- The difference: external command -> internal Spirit causing obedience
- No new law is given; the Spirit enables obedience to the existing law
- "Cause you to walk" -- the Spirit provides the power the old covenant lacked (human promise alone)
**Cross-references:** Rom 8:3-4: "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Same concept: the Spirit enables what the law required but the flesh could not do.

#### Ezekiel 18:31 (Make You a New Heart)
**Context:** God calls Israel to repentance.
**Direct statement:** "Cast away from you all your transgressions...and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?"
**Key observations:**
- The imperative "make you a new heart" suggests human responsibility in response to God's offer
- Paired with casting away "transgressions" -- sin is still defined by the existing law
- Complements Eze 36:26-27 where God says "I will give you" a new heart

#### Deuteronomy 30:6 (Circumcise Thine Heart)
**Context:** Moses describes future restoration after exile.
**Direct statement:** "The LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live."
**Key observations:**
- GOD performs the heart circumcision -- "the LORD thy God will circumcise"
- The purpose: "to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart" -- the first great commandment (Deu 6:5)
- Anticipates the new covenant: God will transform the heart to enable obedience
- The content of obedience (love God) does not change; the heart's capacity changes
**Cross-references:** Rom 2:29: "circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit."

### C. NEW COVENANT NT EXPOSITION

#### Hebrews 8:1-13 (Better Covenant, Better Promises, First Made Old)
**Context:** The central NT exposition of the old/new covenant relationship. The author of Hebrews has been arguing that Christ's priesthood supersedes the Levitical priesthood (chapters 7-10). This chapter presents Christ as mediator of a better covenant.

**Verse-by-verse:**

**8:1-5 (The Sum: Christ's Heavenly Ministry)**
- "We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens" (v.1)
- The earthly priests "serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things" (v.5)
- Context: the discussion is about MINISTRY (leitourgia), SANCTUARY, and PRIESTHOOD -- not about the moral law

**8:6 (Mediator of a Better Covenant)**
- "He is the mediator (mesites, G3316) of a better (kreittonos) covenant (diathekes), which was established upon better promises (epangeliais)"
- Greek parsing: nenomothetētai (G3549, Perfect Passive Indicative) = "has been enacted/legislated upon"
- The covenant is "better" -- not the law content, but the covenant arrangement
- "Better promises" -- the basis is God's promise, not human promise (Israel's "we will do")

**8:7 (If the First Had Been Faultless)**
- "For if that first [covenant] had been faultless (amemptos, G273), then should no place have been sought for the second"
- The first covenant was not amemptos (blameless/faultless)
- The fault is identified in the next verse

**8:8 (Finding Fault WITH THEM)**
- Greek: memphomenos (G3201, Present Middle Participle) gar autous (G846, Accusative Plural Masculine) -- "finding fault with THEM"
- The grammatical object of "finding fault" is autous -- THEM (masculine accusative plural), referring to the people
- The text does NOT say "finding fault with IT" (the covenant or the law). The Greek is unambiguous: the fault is with the people.
- This is confirmed by Jer 31:32 / Heb 8:9: "they continued not in my covenant"

**8:9 (They Continued Not in My Covenant)**
- enemeinen (G1696, Aorist Active Indicative 3P) = "they continued not" / "they remained not"
- amelesa (G272, Aorist Active Indicative 1S) = "I regarded them not" / "I neglected them"
- The people failed to continue in the covenant; God's response was to disregard them
- Confirms the fault was with the people's faithlessness, not the covenant's content

**8:10 (I Will Put My Laws Into Their Mind and Write Them in Their Hearts)**
- Greek: didous nomous mou eis ten dianoian auton, kai epi kardias auton epigrapsō autous
- nomous mou = "MY LAWS" (G3551, Accusative Plural) -- God claims ownership with the possessive pronoun
- dianoia = "mind/understanding" (G1271) -- the cognitive faculty
- kardias = "hearts" (G2588, Accusative Plural) -- the affective/volitional center
- epigrapsō = "I will inscribe/write upon" (G1924, Future Active Indicative 1st Singular)
- The new covenant promise: God's laws (nomous mou) -- the same laws -- written on minds and hearts
- The Hebrew source (Jer 31:33) uses "torati" (my torah); the Greek uses "nomous mou" (my laws)
- What changes: LOCATION (stone -> mind/heart). What remains: the laws themselves ("my laws")

**8:11-12 (Knowledge and Forgiveness)**
- Universal knowledge of God: "all shall know me, from the least to the greatest"
- Forgiveness: "I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more"
- These are the "better promises" -- not better law content, but better provision (knowledge, forgiveness)

**8:13 (He Hath Made the First Old)**
- Greek: pepalaiōken (G3822, Perfect Active Indicative 3S) = "has made old" -- completed action
- palaioumenon (G3822, Present Passive Participle, Nominative NEUTER) = "being made old"
- gēraskon (G1095, Present Active Participle, Nominative NEUTER) = "growing old"
- aphanismou (G854, Genitive Singular) = "of vanishing"
- The NEUTER participles (palaioumenon, gēraskon) do NOT agree with diathēkē (FEMININE). They agree with the neuter article to -- "THAT WHICH is being made old."
- What is "vanishing"? The context identifies it: the old covenant ARRANGEMENT (not the law content), specifically the priesthood, sanctuary service, and blood ratification that characterized the first covenant.
- The text says "in that he saith A NEW, he hath made the first old" -- calling it "new" implies the first is now "old." This is about the covenant framework.

#### Hebrews 9:1-10 (First Covenant Had Ordinances of Divine Service)
**Context:** The author specifies what the "first covenant" consisted of in practical terms.
**Direct statement:** "The first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary" (v.1). The passage describes the tabernacle, its furnishings, and the priestly rituals (vv.2-7). It identifies these as "a figure for the time then present" (v.9), consisting of "meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation" (v.10).
**Key observations:**
- The "first covenant" elements that Hebrews discusses are: sanctuary, priesthood, sacrifices, washings, carnal ordinances
- These are ceremonial/ritual elements, not the Decalogue
- "Imposed until the time of reformation" -- temporary by design
- These are the elements being superseded, not the moral law
- The moral law (Decalogue) is not listed among these "ordinances of divine service"

#### Hebrews 9:11-22 (Blood of the New Covenant; Christ as Mediator)
**Context:** Christ's superior sacrifice and mediation.
**Direct statement:** Christ entered "by his own blood...having obtained eternal redemption" (v.12). He is "the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament" (v.15). The first testament was "dedicated with blood" (v.18) -- Moses sprinkled blood on the book and the people (vv.19-20).
**Key observations:**
- The change of mediator: Moses -> Christ
- The change of blood: animal blood -> Christ's own blood
- The change of redemption: temporary covering -> eternal redemption
- The concept of testament/will (diathēkē can mean both covenant and testament) -- "where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator" (v.16)
- v.15: Christ's death provides "redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament" -- the transgressions existed because the law defined them; the law is presupposed as continuing (transgressions need a standard)

#### Hebrews 10:1-18 (Sacrifices Removed; Law on Hearts)
**Context:** The author concludes his argument about the superiority of Christ's sacrifice.
**Direct statement:**
- v.1: "The law having a shadow of good things to come...can never with those sacrifices...make the comers thereunto perfect"
- v.9: "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second"
- vv.15-17: The Holy Spirit witnesses: "This is the covenant that I will make with them...I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more"
- v.18: "Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin"

**Key observations:**
- "The law having a shadow" -- in context, "the law" here refers to the sacrificial system ("those sacrifices which they offered year by year," v.1)
- v.9: "He taketh away THE FIRST, that he may establish THE SECOND" -- the first = sacrificial system; the second = Christ's will/sacrifice (vv.5-10 are about sacrifice/offering vs. doing God's will)
- vv.15-17: WITHIN the passage that terminates the sacrificial system, the author quotes Jer 31:33-34 about writing laws on hearts. The same passage does BOTH: removes ceremonial sacrifices AND affirms the moral law written on hearts.
- This is a key structural observation: Heb 10:1-9 abolishes the ceremonial system; Heb 10:15-17 affirms the moral law continues via the new covenant. Both happen in the same argument.
- Greek in v.16: nomous mou epi kardias auton = "my laws upon their hearts" -- same construction as Heb 8:10

#### Hebrews 12:18-24 (Sinai vs. Sion Contrast)
**Context:** The author contrasts the old covenant experience at Sinai with the new covenant reality.
**Direct statement:** "Ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest" (v.18) -- describing Sinai. "But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem...And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel" (vv.22, 24).
**Key observations:**
- The contrast is between two EXPERIENCES/ADMINISTRATIONS, not two law codes
- Sinai: fire, darkness, trembling, terror, earthly mountain
- Sion: heavenly Jerusalem, angels, church, Jesus as mediator, better blood
- The elements contrasted: mountain (earthly vs. heavenly), atmosphere (terror vs. joy), mediator (Moses implied vs. Jesus stated), blood (Abel's vs. Christ's sprinkled blood)
- No contrast is drawn between two different sets of laws
- The text says "Jesus the mediator of the NEW COVENANT" -- the change is in mediator and covenant administration

#### Hebrews 13:20 (Blood of the Everlasting Covenant)
**Context:** Benediction of Hebrews.
**Direct statement:** "The God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant."
**Key observations:**
- The new covenant is called "the everlasting covenant" (diathēkēs aiōniou)
- It is established "through the blood" of Christ
- "Everlasting" points to permanence -- this covenant does not decay or pass away
- The law written on hearts in this everlasting covenant is, by implication, everlasting too

#### Hebrews 7:22 (Jesus Surety of a Better Testament)
**Context:** Within the argument that Christ's Melchizedek priesthood supersedes the Levitical.
**Direct statement:** "By so much was Jesus made a surety (engyos, G1450) of a better testament (diathēkēs)."
**Key observations:**
- Jesus is the GUARANTEE (engyos, hapax legomenon) of a better covenant
- The covenant is "better" -- not the law, but the covenant arrangement
- The context (entire chapter 7) is about priesthood change, not moral law change

#### 2 Corinthians 3:1-18 (Letter vs. Spirit; Glory of Old vs. New)
**Context:** Paul defends his apostolic ministry by contrasting the old and new covenant ministrations.
**Direct statement:**
- v.3: "The epistle of Christ...written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart"
- v.6: "Ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life"
- v.7: "The ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious"
- v.11: "If that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious"

**Key observations:**
1. **Grammar of v.7:** katargoumenēn (G2673, Present Passive Participle) is ACCUSATIVE SINGULAR FEMININE. It agrees with tēn doxan (the glory, feminine), NOT with diakonia (ministration, nominative feminine) or gramma (letter, neuter). What is "being done away" is the GLORY of Moses' face (cf. Exo 34:33-35), not the law written on stones.

2. **The contrast is between MINISTRATIONS (diakonia), not between laws:**
   - "Ministration of death" (v.7) vs. "ministration of the spirit" (v.8)
   - "Ministration of condemnation" (v.9) vs. "ministration of righteousness" (v.9)
   - The law on stone CONDEMNED because it met a hard heart (external law + sinful heart = condemnation)
   - The same law on hearts GIVES LIFE because the Spirit writes it internally (law + Spirit = righteousness)

3. **v.11 neuter participles:** katargoumenon (Present Passive Participle, Nominative NEUTER) and menon (Present Active Participle, Nominative NEUTER). "That which is done away" and "that which remaineth" are both neuter, not feminine (diathēkē) or masculine (nomos). The neuter refers to the general state of affairs / administration, not specifically to the law.

4. **Tables of stone -> fleshy tables of the heart (v.3):** The SAME content (the writing) moves from one surface to another. The contrast is the surface (stone vs. heart) and the agent (ink/engraving vs. Spirit), not the content.

5. **Letter vs. Spirit (v.6):** The "letter" (gramma) refers to the law as external written code without the Spirit's power; the "spirit" (pneuma) refers to the law internalized and empowered by the Spirit. The same law functions differently depending on the covenant administration: externally it condemns; internally through the Spirit it gives life.

*(2 Cor 3 is examined in depth in law-08-abolished-at-cross.)*

#### Galatians 3:15-22 (Covenant Cannot Be Disannulled; Promise to Abraham)
**Context:** Paul argues that the Abrahamic promise (covenant of grace) was not annulled by the later Sinai law.
**Direct statement:**
- v.15: "Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto"
- v.17: "The covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul"
- v.19: "Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come"
- v.21: "Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid"

**Key observations:**
- The Abrahamic covenant (promise) is prior to and not annulled by the Sinai law
- "The law...was added because of transgressions" -- to expose and define sin, not to provide salvation
- "Till the seed should come" -- a temporal function of the law's custodial/pedagogical role (expanded in 3:24-25)
- v.21: The law is NOT against the promises -- Paul denies any fundamental contradiction
- The question of WHICH aspect of "the law" Paul refers to ("added because of transgressions, till the seed should come") involves the pedagogical/custodial function -- the law as condemning force (the "ministration of condemnation" from 2 Cor 3:9) that drives people to Christ

#### Galatians 4:21-31 (Two Covenants Allegory)
**Context:** Paul uses Sarah/Hagar as an allegory of two covenants.
**Direct statement:** "These are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar" (v.24). "Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all" (v.26). "We are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free" (v.31).
**Key observations:**
- Paul calls this "an allegory" (allegeroumena, v.24) -- he explicitly identifies the genre
- The Sinai covenant "gendereth to bondage" -- the old covenant arrangement produces bondage because it is based on human effort ("we will do") meeting divine standards without Spirit empowerment
- The "Jerusalem above" covenant produces freedom -- the new covenant based on God's promise
- The allegory is about the PRINCIPLE of each covenant (law-keeping by human effort vs. promise received by faith), not about the abolition of the law's content
- Paul does not say the law is bad; he says depending on the law-keeping arrangement without grace/Spirit is bondage

#### Lord's Supper Texts (Mat 26:28; Mrk 14:24; Luk 22:20; 1 Cor 11:25)
**Context:** Jesus institutes the Lord's Supper at the Last Supper.
**Direct statement:**
- Mat 26:28: "This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins"
- Luk 22:20: "This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you"
- 1 Cor 11:25: "This cup is the new testament in my blood"

**Key observations:**
- Jesus explicitly identifies His blood as the ratification blood of the "new testament" (kainē diathēkē)
- Parallel to Exo 24:8: Moses said "Behold the blood of the covenant"; Jesus says "This is my blood of the new testament"
- The change: animal blood -> Christ's blood
- "For the remission of sins" (Mat 26:28) -- this is the "better promise" (forgiveness) of Jer 31:34 / Heb 8:12
- Jesus does not say "this new covenant has new laws" -- He establishes the new covenant by His blood for forgiveness

### D. HEART RENEWAL AND TRANSFORMATION

#### Psalm 51:10 (Create in Me a Clean Heart)
**Context:** David's penitential psalm after his sin with Bathsheba.
**Direct statement:** "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me."
**Key observations:**
- David recognizes his need for God to create (bara) a clean heart -- the same verb used in Genesis 1
- This is an OT anticipation of the new covenant promise (Eze 36:26)
- David does not ask for new laws; he asks for a new heart

#### Psalm 40:8 (Thy Law Within My Heart)
**Context:** A Messianic psalm (quoted in Heb 10:7-9).
**Direct statement:** "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart."
**Key observations:**
- The experience of having God's law "within my heart" is presented as the ideal
- This is the new covenant experience described in Jer 31:33
- The law is the SAME law ("thy law"); its location is "within my heart"
- The attitude is delight, not grudging compliance

#### Romans 2:14-15, 29 (Law Written in Hearts; Circumcision of Heart)
**Context:** Paul discusses God's impartial judgment of Jew and Gentile.
**Direct statement:**
- vv.14-15: "The Gentiles...do by nature the things contained in the law...the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness"
- v.29: "Circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter"

**Key observations:**
- Even Gentiles without the written law have "the work of the law written in their hearts"
- This is a universal testimony to moral law (not ceremonial -- Gentiles have no natural knowledge of sacrifices or feast days)
- v.29: True circumcision is of the heart, "in the spirit" -- new covenant language
- The moral law content is constant; its mode of access varies (conscience, stone, heart-writing)

### E. COVENANT TERMS / COMMANDMENTS CONTINUITY

#### Romans 3:31 (Faith Establishes the Law)
**Context:** Paul has just argued that justification is by faith apart from works of law.
**Direct statement:** "Do we then make void (katargoumen) the law through faith? God forbid (mē genoito): yea, we establish (histanomen) the law."
**Key observations:**
- Paul uses the strongest possible denial: mē genoito ("may it never be!")
- histanomen (G2476, Present Active Indicative) = "we establish/make to stand"
- Faith does not void the law; it ESTABLISHES it
- The new covenant (faith-based) does not abolish the law; it upholds it

#### Romans 8:3-4, 7 (Law's Righteous Requirement Fulfilled in Us)
**Context:** Paul describes the Spirit's work in the new covenant believer.
**Direct statement:**
- v.3: "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh" -- the law's limitation was not in itself but in the flesh
- v.4: "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit"
- v.7: "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be"

**Key observations:**
- The law was "weak through the flesh" -- the deficiency was in human nature, not in the law
- The Spirit enables fulfillment of the law's "righteousness" (dikaiōma, G1345) in believers
- v.7 assumes the law of God remains the standard: the carnal mind's failure is its inability to submit to God's law
- This is the new covenant mechanism: the Spirit enables obedience to the same law that the flesh could not keep

#### Matthew 5:17-19 (Not Come to Destroy the Law)
**Context:** Jesus' Sermon on the Mount -- foundational teaching of the new covenant era.
**Direct statement:** "Think not that I am come to destroy (katalusai) the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil (plērōsai)."
**Key observations:**
- Jesus explicitly denies He came to destroy/abolish (kataluo) the law
- "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law" (v.18) -- the law's permanence
- v.19: Breaking commandments and teaching others to do so results in being "least in the kingdom"
- This is Jesus inaugurating the new covenant era while affirming the moral law's permanence

*(Examined in depth in law-10 study on Mat 5:17-19.)*

#### John 14:15 (If Ye Love Me Keep My Commandments)
**Context:** Jesus' upper room discourse, the night of the Last Supper (when He instituted the new covenant in His blood).
**Direct statement:** "If ye love me, keep my commandments."
**Key observations:**
- On the same night Jesus establishes the new covenant (Luk 22:20), He commands keeping His commandments
- The new covenant does not eliminate commandment-keeping; it motivates it through love

#### 1 Corinthians 7:19 (Keeping the Commandments of God)
**Context:** Paul addresses questions about circumcision and calling.
**Direct statement:** "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."
**Key observations:**
- Paul dismisses circumcision (ceremonial) as "nothing"
- Paul affirms "the commandments of God" (entolai theou) as what matters
- This verse itself distinguishes between a ceremonial requirement (circumcision = nothing) and moral commandments (keeping = everything)
- The distinction between ceremonial (abolished) and moral (continues) is present in a single verse

#### 1 John 5:3 (Love of God = Keep His Commandments)
**Context:** John defines love for God.
**Direct statement:** "This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous."
**Key observations:**
- Love is defined as commandment-keeping (the new covenant principle: love fulfills the law)
- "His commandments are not grievous" -- under the new covenant, with the Spirit and a new heart, the commandments are not burdensome
- This is the new covenant experience: law on the heart produces willing obedience

#### Revelation 14:12 (Commandments of God and Faith of Jesus)
**Context:** End-time description of God's people.
**Direct statement:** "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
**Key observations:**
- God's end-time people are characterized by TWO things: (1) keeping the commandments of God, and (2) the faith of Jesus
- Commandment-keeping is not opposed to faith; they coexist
- The phrase "commandments of God" (entolas tou theou) distinguishes from commandments of men or ceremonial requirements

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Consistent Identification of Covenant Terms as the Decalogue
- Exo 34:28: "the words of the covenant, the ten commandments"
- Deu 4:13: "his covenant, even ten commandments"
- Deu 9:9, 11: "the tables of the covenant"
- Deu 5:2-22: Covenant at Horeb = the Ten Commandments as recited
- The covenant terms are explicitly and repeatedly identified as the Decalogue

### Pattern 2: The Law Content Remains Constant Across Covenants
- Jer 31:33: "my law (torati)" -- God's existing torah
- Heb 8:10: "my laws (nomous mou)" -- God's existing laws
- Heb 10:16: "my laws (nomous mou)" -- same phrase repeated
- Eze 36:27: "my statutes...my judgments" -- pre-existing statutes
- Eze 11:20: "my statutes...mine ordinances" -- same pre-existing laws
- In every new covenant text, God writes HIS (already existing) law, not a new one

### Pattern 3: What Changes Between Covenants (LOCATION/POWER/MEDIATOR/BASIS)
- **Location:** Stone -> heart (Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10; 2 Cor 3:3)
- **Power:** Human promise ("we will do") -> God's action ("I will put") + Spirit (Eze 36:27; Rom 8:4)
- **Mediator:** Moses (Deu 5:5; Gal 3:19) -> Christ (Heb 8:6; 9:15; 12:24)
- **Basis/Blood:** Animal blood (Exo 24:8) -> Christ's blood (Mat 26:28; Heb 9:12; 13:20)
- **Forgiveness:** Temporary covering -> "I will remember their sin no more" (Jer 31:34; Heb 8:12)

### Pattern 4: The Fault Was With the People, Not the Law
- Heb 8:8: "finding fault with THEM" (autous, masculine accusative)
- Jer 31:32: "which my covenant THEY brake" (hepheru)
- Heb 8:9: "they continued not in my covenant"
- Deu 5:29: "O that there were such an heart in THEM"
- Deu 29:4: "the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive"
- Rom 8:3: "what the law could not do, in that it was weak through THE FLESH"
- In every text, the problem is human inability, not law inadequacy

### Pattern 5: Hebrews Specifies Ceremonial Elements as What Changes
- Heb 9:1: "ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary"
- Heb 9:9-10: "gifts and sacrifices...meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation"
- Heb 10:1-4: "those sacrifices which they offered year by year"
- Heb 10:5-9: "sacrifice and offering" taken away; God's will established
- The elements being superseded are consistently identified as ceremonial/sacrificial

### Pattern 6: New Covenant Affirms Law on Hearts in Same Passages That Remove Ceremonies
- Heb 10:1-9 removes sacrifices; Heb 10:15-17 affirms "my laws into their hearts"
- The author of Hebrews does BOTH in the same argument without contradiction
- 2 Cor 3: contrasts old and new ministrations while the content (what is written) moves from stone to heart

## Connections Between Passages

### Jeremiah 31:33 -> Hebrews 8:10 -> Hebrews 10:16
The same new covenant promise is quoted three times in the NT (Heb 8:10; 10:16; cf. 2 Cor 3:3). Each time, the content is "MY laws" (nomous mou) written on hearts. The Hebrew source uses "torati" (my torah). The consistent possessive pronoun across both testaments identifies the law as God's pre-existing law, not a novel set of commands.

### Deuteronomy 5:29 -> Jeremiah 31:33 -> Ezekiel 36:26-27 -> Romans 8:3-4
This is a progressive development:
1. God wishes Israel had a heart to keep His commands (Deu 5:29)
2. God promises to write His law on hearts (Jer 31:33)
3. God promises the Spirit will cause obedience to His statutes (Eze 36:26-27)
4. Paul identifies the Spirit as enabling the law's fulfillment in believers (Rom 8:3-4)

The thread runs from God's lament -> God's promise -> God's mechanism -> Paul's confirmation. The law content is constant throughout.

### Exodus 24:8 -> Matthew 26:28 -> Hebrews 9:18-20 -> Hebrews 12:24
Blood ratification thread:
1. Moses sprinkles ox blood: "Behold the blood of the covenant" (Exo 24:8)
2. Jesus says: "This is my blood of the new testament" (Mat 26:28)
3. Hebrews recalls: "the first testament was dedicated without blood" (Heb 9:18)
4. Believers come to "Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling" (Heb 12:24)

The ratification mechanism changes (animal blood -> Christ's blood) while the covenant concept continues.

### Deuteronomy 4:13-14 -> 1 Corinthians 7:19 -> Hebrews 10:1-17
The distinction between covenant terms (Decalogue) and other legislation:
1. Deu 4:13-14 separates "his covenant, even ten commandments" from "statutes and judgments" taught by Moses
2. 1 Cor 7:19 separates circumcision (nothing) from "the commandments of God" (everything)
3. Heb 10:1-17 removes the sacrificial system while affirming "my laws" on hearts

## Word Study Insights

### berith (H1285) / diatheke (G1242)
The covenant concept (berith/diathēkē) is the constant structural term. The same word is used for both old and new covenants. What is "new" (chadashah/kainos) is the COVENANT (berith), not the law (torah/nomos). The new covenant does not create a new torah; it establishes a new berith with the same torah written in a new location.

### torah (H8451) / nomos (G3551)
In Jer 31:33, God says "torati" (my torah). In Heb 8:10 and 10:16, this becomes "nomous mou" (my laws). The possessive pronoun in both languages ("my") identifies the law as God's own, pre-existing law. If the new covenant had a different law, one would expect "a new law" or "another torah" -- but the text says "MY torah/laws."

### palaioo (G3822) and aphanismos (G854)
In Heb 8:13, "making old" (palaioo) and "vanishing" (aphanismos) are applied to the first COVENANT (diathēkē), not to the law (nomos). The neuter participles (palaioumenon, gēraskon) do not agree with the feminine diathēkē either -- they point to the general old-covenant state of affairs (the ceremonial system, priesthood, and earthly sanctuary) as what is passing away.

### memphomenos autous (G3201 + G846) in Heb 8:8
"Finding fault with THEM" -- the masculine accusative plural autous is grammatically unambiguous. The subject of fault-finding is the people, not the covenant terms. This is the hinge of the entire old/new covenant argument: the people failed, so God provides a new arrangement with the same law but better provision.

## Difficult Passages

### Hebrews 8:13 -- "Ready to Vanish Away"
The language of "decaying," "waxing old," and "ready to vanish away" could be read as applying to the entire old covenant including its moral content. However: (1) the context of Hebrews 7-10 consistently identifies what is changing as the priesthood, sacrifices, and sanctuary service; (2) the grammar (neuter participles, not feminine to agree with diathēkē) points to the general state of affairs rather than the covenant as such; (3) the same passage (Heb 8:10) affirms "my laws" written on hearts as the new covenant content. The vanishing concerns the old covenant ADMINISTRATION (priesthood, sanctuary, blood sacrifices), not the moral law content that is being RELOCATED from stone to heart.

### 2 Corinthians 3:7 -- "Ministration of Death, Written and Engraven in Stones"
The Decalogue is referenced ("written and engraven in stones"), and it is called "the ministration of death." This could suggest the Decalogue itself is being abolished. However: (1) Paul speaks of the MINISTRATION (diakonia), not the law itself; (2) the thing "done away" (katargoumenēn, feminine) grammatically agrees with the GLORY (doxan, feminine), not the law or ministration; (3) Paul elsewhere calls this same law "holy, just, good, spiritual" (Rom 7:12,14); (4) the law kills because it meets sinful flesh externally -- this is the old covenant condition (external law + hard heart = condemnation). The new covenant solves this by internalizing the same law through the Spirit (2 Cor 3:3, 8).

*(Examined in depth in law-08-abolished-at-cross.)*

### Galatians 4:24-25 -- Sinai Covenant "Gendereth to Bondage"
Paul calls the Sinai covenant a source of "bondage" (douleia). This could imply the entire Sinai arrangement, including the moral law, is to be rejected. However: (1) Paul explicitly identifies this as "an allegory" (v.24); (2) the bondage of Sinai is the condition of trying to earn righteousness by human effort under the law without the Spirit's enabling; (3) Paul himself says "the law is holy" (Rom 7:12) and "we establish the law" (Rom 3:31); (4) the contrast is between two covenantal PRINCIPLES (human works vs. divine promise), not between the moral law and its absence.

### Galatians 3:19 -- "The Law Was Added Because of Transgressions"
"Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come." This could suggest the law was temporary. However: (1) "added" (prosetethē) may refer to the law's formal codification at Sinai, not its first existence (Gen 26:5 shows commandments before Sinai); (2) "till the seed should come" may refer to the law's custodial/condemning function, not the law itself (Gal 3:24: the law as schoolmaster/guardian until Christ); (3) Paul immediately denies the law contradicts the promise (v.21).
