# What Is the Old Covenant and What Is the New Covenant?

## Question
What is the Old Covenant and what is the New Covenant? What exactly is "old" -- the law itself, or the arrangement/administration? The old covenant had the law on stone with external obedience; the new covenant has the same law written on hearts with internal transformation. Is the difference the CONTENT of the law or the LOCATION/POWER/MEDIATOR/BASIS?

## Summary Answer
The Old Covenant was the bilateral agreement at Sinai in which God proposed terms (the Ten Commandments), Israel accepted ("we will do"), and the covenant was ratified by animal blood (Exo 24:8). The New Covenant, prophesied in Jeremiah 31:31-34 and expounded in Hebrews 8-10, is God's promise to write the SAME law ("my torah" / "my laws") on hearts rather than stone, with Christ as mediator, His blood as ratification, the Spirit as enabling power, and complete forgiveness as the basis. The text consistently identifies what is "old" as the covenant ARRANGEMENT (priesthood, sanctuary, blood, human promise), not the law content. The law itself (torati/nomous mou) is the constant; the location, power, mediator, and basis change.

## Key Verses
- **Deu 4:13** -- "He declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone."
- **Jer 31:31-33** -- "I will make a new covenant...not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers...I will put my law (torati) in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts."
- **Heb 8:8, 10** -- "Finding fault with them (autous)...I will put my laws (nomous mou) into their mind, and write them in their hearts."
- **Heb 10:15-17** -- "I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more."
- **Eze 36:26-27** -- "A new heart also will I give you...I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes."
- **2 Cor 3:3** -- "Written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart."

## Analysis

### The Old Covenant: Structure and Terms

The Sinai covenant has a clearly defined structure. God proposed the covenant relationship (Exo 19:5-6), Israel accepted (Exo 19:8; 24:3, 7), the terms were the Ten Commandments (Deu 4:13; Exo 34:28), and the covenant was ratified by blood (Exo 24:5-8). Moses served as mediator (Deu 5:5), and the covenant terms were written on stone tablets by God's own finger (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10). These tablets are explicitly called "the tables of the covenant" (Deu 9:9, 11).

The identification of the covenant terms with the Decalogue is stated multiple times: "his covenant, even ten commandments" (Deu 4:13); "the words of the covenant, the ten commandments" (Exo 34:28). Deu 4:13-14 then distinguishes the covenant terms (the Decalogue on stone) from additional "statutes and judgments" that God commanded Moses to teach -- a distinction made in consecutive verses.

The old covenant's weakness was not in its terms (the law) but in the people's inability to keep them. Deu 5:29: "O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always." Deu 29:4: "the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive." The covenant rested on Israel's promise ("All that the LORD hath spoken we will do," Exo 19:8; 24:3, 7), and they broke that promise (Jer 31:32; Heb 8:9).

### The New Covenant: What Changes and What Remains

Jeremiah 31:31-34 specifies the new covenant in detail. The Hebrew text is precise: "I will put MY LAW (torati, [H8451](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8451/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} with 1st-person suffix) in their inward parts (b'qirbam), and write it in their hearts (libbam)" (v.33). The verb "write" (ekhtabenah, from katab H3789) carries a 3rd-person feminine singular suffix referring back to torah (feminine). God says He will write IT -- His torah -- on hearts. The same verb (katab) is used for writing the Decalogue on stone (Exo 34:1; Deu 10:2, 4). The writing action is the same; the surface changes.

The new covenant is explicitly "not according to" the old covenant (Jer 31:32). What is "not according to" is the BERITH (covenant arrangement), not the TORAH (law content). The torah is the constant: "my torah." What changes is the arrangement.

Ezekiel 36:26-27 provides the mechanism: "I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes (chuqqot) and keep my judgments (mishpatim)." The Spirit causes obedience to the SAME statutes and judgments. No new law is introduced; the Spirit enables obedience to the pre-existing law.

### The NT Confirms: Same Law, Different Administration

Hebrews 8:10 (quoting Jer 31:33): "I will put my laws (nomous mou) into their mind, and write them in their hearts." The possessive pronoun "my" identifies the laws as God's existing laws -- not a new or different set.

Hebrews 8:8 identifies the fault: "finding fault with THEM (autous, masculine accusative plural)." The Greek is grammatically unambiguous -- the fault is with the people, not the law or the covenant terms.

Hebrews 9:1-10 specifies what the "first covenant" practically consisted of: "ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary" (v.1), consisting of "meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation" (v.10). These are ceremonial elements.

Hebrews 10:1-17 performs both operations in a single argument: it removes the sacrificial system (vv.1-9: "sacrifice and offering...he taketh away the first, that he may establish the second") and affirms the moral law written on hearts (vv.15-17: "I will put my laws into their hearts").

2 Corinthians 3:3 states the contrast directly: "not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart." The content (what is written) is the same; the surface (stone vs. heart) changes. The agent changes too: "not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God."

Romans 8:3-4: "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh...that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." The law's "weakness" was through the flesh (the old covenant problem); the Spirit enables the law's fulfillment (the new covenant solution).

### The Five Differences Between Covenants

The evidence identifies five specific differences between old and new covenants:

1. **LOCATION:** Stone tablets -> hearts and minds (Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10; 2 Cor 3:3)
2. **POWER:** Human promise ("we will do") -> God's action ("I will put") + Holy Spirit (Eze 36:27; Rom 8:4)
3. **MEDIATOR:** Moses (Deu 5:5; Gal 3:19) -> Christ (Heb 8:6; 9:15; 12:24)
4. **BASIS/BLOOD:** Animal blood (Exo 24:8) -> Christ's blood (Mat 26:28; Heb 9:12; 13:20)
5. **FORGIVENESS:** "I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more" (Jer 31:34; Heb 8:12)

None of these five is a change in the law's content.

| E19 | "In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away." The first covenant arrangement is made old by the new. | Heb 8:13 | Neutral | E275* | V1/V2: "vanish away" is cessation vocabulary (V2), but the SUBJECT is the first covenant arrangement, not specifically the moral law. Gate 1: referent is the first covenant (diathēkē), not the moral law (nomos). The neuter participles (palaioumenon, gēraskon) do not agree with diathēkē (feminine). Referent is ambiguous between the whole covenant arrangement and just the ceremonial elements. IP0 consideration: if the "old" refers to the ceremonial administration, this is common ground. Neutral because the text says the first COVENANT (arrangement) is vanishing -- both sides agree the old covenant arrangement (with its earthly sanctuary, Levitical priesthood, animal sacrifices) has been superseded. |
| E20 | "The first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary." The first covenant's practical content included the sanctuary service. | Heb 9:1 | Neutral | E276* | V1/V2: cessation vocabulary context, but describes ceremonial elements both sides agree are abolished. Neutral (common ground). |
| E21 | "[The sanctuary service consisted of] meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation." These ceremonial elements were temporary. | Heb 9:10 | Neutral | E136 | Already registered. *(Examined in depth in law-08.)* Updated Also In -> law-09. |
| E22 | "He is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance." Christ's death redeems from transgressions -- transgressions presuppose a continuing moral standard. | Heb 9:15 | Neutral | E277* | V1/V2: neither directly. "Transgressions under the first testament" presupposes law, but does not directly state continuation or cessation of moral law. Neutral. |
| E23 | "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more." (Second NT quotation of Jer 31:33-34, within the passage that removes the sacrificial system.) | Heb 10:16-17 | Continues | E039 | Already registered. (Same observation as E039.) Updated Also In -> law-09. |
| E24 | "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second." In context (Heb 10:5-10), "the first" = sacrifice and offering; "the second" = doing God's will / Christ's once-for-all offering. | Heb 10:9 | Neutral | E278* | V1/V2: cessation vocabulary ("taketh away"), but context identifies "the first" as sacrifices/offerings (v.5-8), which is common ground. Neutral (ceremonial cessation). |
| E25 | "Ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched...But ye are come unto mount Sion...and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel." Contrast between Sinai experience and new covenant experience. | Heb 12:18-24 | Neutral | E279* | V1/V2: neither directly addresses moral law. Contrasts covenant administrations (Sinai terror vs. heavenly Sion). Neutral. |
| E26 | "The God of peace...through the blood of the everlasting covenant." The new covenant is called "everlasting." | Heb 13:20 | Neutral | E280* | V1/V2: neither. Factual observation about new covenant's duration. Neutral. |
| E27 | "By so much was Jesus made a surety (engyos) of a better testament." Jesus guarantees a better covenant. | Heb 7:22 | Neutral | E281* | V1/V2: neither directly. States Christ's role as surety. Neutral. |
| E28 | "[Ye are] manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart." Same content (epistle/writing), different surface (stone -> heart) and agent (ink -> Spirit). | 2 Cor 3:3 | Continues | E282* | V1: law-continuation vocabulary -- the content written on stone is now written on hearts. The contrast is surface/agent, not content. [G1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: referent = the writing that was on stone, now on heart.

| E29 | "The ministration (diakonia) of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious...the ministration of the spirit...rather glorious." The contrast is between MINISTRATIONS (diakonia), not between the law and something else. | 2 Cor 3:7-8 | Neutral | E283* | V1/V2: "done away" language present but the SUBJECT is the diakonia (ministration) / the GLORY (katargoumenēn, fem, agrees with doxan). Neutral because: the text uses "ministration of death" not "law of death"; what is "done away" grammatically is the glory. Both sides can accept this textual observation. *(Examined in depth in law-08.)* |
| E30 | In 2 Cor 3:7, katargoumenēn (G2673) is feminine singular, agreeing with tēn doxan (the glory, feminine), not with diakonia (ministration, nominative) or gramma (letter, neuter). | 2 Cor 3:7 (grammar) | Neutral | E251 | Already registered. Updated Also In -> law-09. |

[G1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: referent = "the law" generally; context (Rom 7:7-8:4) identifies by 10th commandment (Rom 7:7).

Jesus commands obedience on the same night He institutes the new covenant in His blood. | Joh 14:15 | Neutral | E286* | V1: "keep my commandments" is continuation vocabulary. But [G1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: "my commandments" could refer to Jesus' own teaching rather than specifically the Decalogue. The referent is not specified as the Decalogue in this verse. Neutral (both sides affirm Jesus commands obedience; the question is which commandments). |

The experience of having God's law within one's heart. | Psa 40:8 | Continues | E288* | V1: "thy law is within my heart" = law-continuation + internalization vocabulary.

| E45 | Paul states "Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto." Even human covenants, once confirmed, cannot be annulled. | Gal 3:15 | Neutral | E289* | V1/V2: neither. Factual statement about covenant permanence. Neutral. |
| E46 | "The covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect."

Paul explicitly labels this as allegory. | Gal 4:24 | Neutral | E292* | V1/V2: cessation vocabulary ("bondage") associated with Sinai, but V2 fails Gate 3: Paul explicitly says this is ALLEGORY (allegoroumena). Genre gate applies -- allegorical passage. The observation that Paul CALLS it an allegory is itself Neutral. |

### 2. Necessary Implications (N)

*Tree 1 N-CHECK applied: Each follows unavoidably from cited E-items. Tree 4 Gate 0 applied.*

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why Unavoidable | Position | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The covenant terms at Sinai were specifically the Ten Commandments -- not the broader Mosaic legislation. Multiple passages explicitly equate "his covenant" with "ten commandments" (Deu 4:13; Exo 34:28). Deu 4:13-14 then separately mentions "statutes and judgments" that Moses was commanded to teach. | E1 (E005), E2 (E264), E4 (E001), E5 (E002) | Any reader must accept this: three passages explicitly identify the covenant as the Decalogue, and the immediately following verse (Deu 4:14) separately mentions other legislation. | Continues | N001 (existing) + N049* (for the Deu 4:13-14 consecutive-verse distinction as applied to the covenant question) |
| N2 | The old covenant's failure was due to the people's inability to keep it, not any deficiency in the law content. The fault is explicitly with "them" (Heb 8:8, autous), "they brake" the covenant (Jer 31:32), "they continued not" (Heb 8:9), and God wished they had "such an heart" (Deu 5:29). | E6 (E265), E7 (E266), E8 (E267), E10 (E269), E17 (E274), E11 (E038), E36 (E285) | Every text that identifies the problem points to the people or the flesh, never to the law. An Abolished scholar would accept this textual observation -- the text says the fault was with them. | Neutral | N050* |
| N3 | The new covenant promise specifies that GOD'S EXISTING LAW (torati / nomous mou, with possessive pronoun) will be written on hearts. The possessive pronoun "my" in both Hebrew (Jer 31:33: torati) and Greek (Heb 8:10, 10:16: nomous mou) identifies the law as God's own pre-existing law, not a new set of commands. | E11 (E038), E18 (E039), E23 (E039) | The possessive pronoun is a lexical fact. "My law" / "my laws" means the speaker's own law. Both sides must accept that the text uses this possessive form. | Continues | N051* |
| N4 | Hebrews 10:1-17 both removes the sacrificial system (vv.1-9: "sacrifice and offering" taken away) and affirms that God will write "my laws" on hearts (vv.15-17, quoting Jer 31:33). The same passage describes ceremonial removal and moral law continuation. | E23 (E039), E24 (E278) + Heb 10:5-9 | The juxtaposition is observable: vv.1-9 remove sacrifices, vv.15-17 affirm law-on-hearts. Both operations occur in the same authorial argument. Any reader can see this structural feature. | Continues | N044 (existing). Updated Also In -> law-09. |
| N5 | The five differences between old and new covenants identified in the text are all structural/administrative (location, power, mediator, blood/basis, forgiveness), not changes in law content. No new covenant text introduces a different set of moral commands. | E11 (E038), E14 (E040), E16 (E273), E17 (E274), E9 (E268), E31 (E284) | Universal agreement test: an Abolished scholar can verify that the new covenant texts specify changes in location/power/mediator/blood/forgiveness. Whether this means the law content also changes or not is a separate inference. The observation that THESE five are what the text specifies is factual. | Continues | N052* |

### 3. Inferences (I)

*Tree 2 (I-Type) and Tree 5 (I-Positional) applied. IP0 checked first for each.*

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria | Position | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | The new covenant does not abolish the moral law but writes the SAME moral law on hearts. The difference between covenants is entirely in the administration (location, power, mediator, basis), not in the law content. | I-A | Jer 31:33 says "my law (torati)" on hearts (E038); Heb 8:10 says "my laws (nomous mou)" (E039); Eze 36:27 says Spirit causes obedience to "my statutes" (E040); Heb 8:8 says fault was with "them" (E274); Deu 4:13 identifies covenant terms as Ten Commandments (E005); Rom 8:4 says law's righteousness fulfilled in Spirit-walkers (E026). N051 establishes the possessive pronoun identifies pre-existing law. N052 establishes five structural differences. | Systematizes multiple E/N items into a comprehensive claim. All components are text-derived. No E/N statement must be redefined. Only criterion #5 (systematizing). | #5 | Continues | I057* |
| I2 | Hebrews 8:13's "vanishing away" refers to the entire old covenant including the moral law (Decalogue). Since the Decalogue was the covenant terms (Deu 4:13), and the first covenant is "vanishing," the Decalogue is vanishing with it. | I-B | Heb 8:13 says "he hath made the first old...ready to vanish away" (E275); Deu 4:13 identifies covenant terms as Ten Commandments (E005). BUT: Heb 8:10 says "I will put my laws into their hearts" (E039); Heb 8:8 says fault was with "them" (E274); Heb 9:1-10 identifies the first covenant's practical elements as sanctuary/sacrificial service (E276); Heb 10:15-17 affirms law on hearts in the passage removing sacrifices (N044). The neuter participles in 8:13 do not agree with diathēkē (feminine). | Requires choosing what "the first" that is "vanishing" refers to -- the entire covenant including its moral terms, or the covenant administration (priesthood, sanctuary, sacrifices). E/N items on both sides. | #2 (choosing between readings), #5 | Abolished | I058* |
| I3 | 2 Corinthians 3:7-11 teaches that the law "written and engraven in stones" (the Decalogue) has been "done away" and is being replaced by the new covenant ministry of the Spirit. | I-B | 2 Cor 3:7 says "the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones" (E283); 3:11 says "that which is done away" (katargoumenon, neuter). BUT: the feminine participle in 3:7 (katargoumenēn) agrees with "the glory" (doxan), not the law (E251/N041). Paul calls the same law "holy, just, good, spiritual" (E010, E011). Paul says "we establish the law" (E025). | Requires identifying what is "done away" -- the law itself, or the glory/ministration. Competing E/N items. | #2, #5 | Abolished | I046 (existing). Updated Also In -> law-09. |
| I4 | Galatians 4:24-25 teaches that the entire Sinai covenant, including its moral law content, is "bondage" that believers are freed from. The old covenant law itself (including the Decalogue) is the source of bondage. | I-B | Gal 4:24 says the Sinai covenant "gendereth to bondage" (E292). BUT: Paul explicitly labels this as "an allegory" (E292, v.24). Paul elsewhere says "the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (E010); "we establish the law" (E025); the law is "spiritual" (E011). The bondage is from the works-based PRINCIPLE (human effort without Spirit), not from the law's content. | Requires interpreting what produces "bondage" -- the law's content or the covenant arrangement. Genre is allegory (Paul says so). Competing E/N items from same author. | #2, #3 (applying allegorical genre as literal), #5 | Abolished | I059* |
| I5 | Galatians 3:19's "the law was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come" proves the moral law (including the Decalogue) was temporary -- designed to last only until Christ. | I-B | Gal 3:19 says "it was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come" (text). BUT: "added" may refer to formal codification at Sinai (Gen 26:5 shows commandments before Sinai, E034); "till the seed should come" may refer to the law's condemning/custodial function, not the law itself (Gal 3:24-25); Paul denies the law contradicts the promise (Gal 3:21, E291); Paul says "we establish the law" (E025). E021 (Mat 5:17-18): "till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law." | Requires choosing what "added till the seed should come" means -- the law itself is temporary, or the law's condemning/custodial function is temporary. Competing E/N items. | #2, #5 | Abolished | I060* |
| I6 | The old/new covenant transition demonstrates that the Bible distinguishes between categories of law: the ceremonial/sacrificial system is what the "first covenant" practically consisted of (Heb 9:1-10) and is removed, while the moral law ("my laws") is written on hearts (Heb 8:10; 10:16). The covenant transition itself is evidence of the moral/ceremonial distinction. | I-A | Heb 9:1-10 identifies first covenant elements as sanctuary, sacrifices, washings, carnal ordinances (E276, E136); Heb 8:10/10:16 affirms "my laws" on hearts (E039); Heb 10:1-9 removes sacrifices while 10:15-17 affirms law on hearts (N044); 1 Cor 7:19 separates circumcision from commandments of God (E143). | Systematizes the observable pattern across Hebrews into a categorical distinction. All components are text-derived. Only criterion #5. | #5 | Continues | I061* |
| I7 | The covenant transition from old to new is a transition from external administration to internal transformation, not from one set of laws to another. The law is the constant; the covenant is the variable. | I-A | Jer 31:33 = "my torah" on hearts (E038); Heb 8:10 = "my laws" on hearts (E039); Eze 36:27 = Spirit causes obedience to same statutes (E040); 2 Cor 3:3 = stone to heart (E282); Rom 8:3-4 = Spirit fulfills law's righteousness (E026); Heb 8:8 = fault with people (E274); Deu 5:29 = lacked the heart (E265). N052 = five structural differences. | Systematizes the evidence into a comprehensive claim. All components text-derived. Only criterion #5. | #5 | Continues | I062* |

### I-B Resolution Subsections

#### I-B Resolution: I2/I058 -- Heb 8:13 "vanishing" includes the Decalogue

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (Abolished): E005 (covenant terms = Decalogue), E275 (first covenant made old, vanishing)
- AGAINST (Continues): E039 (my laws on hearts, Heb 8:10), E274 (fault with them, Heb 8:8), E276 (first covenant = sanctuary/sacrifice service, Heb 9:1), E136 (carnal ordinances temporary, Heb 9:10), N044 (Heb 10 removes sacrifices while affirming law on hearts), N051 (possessive pronoun = existing law), E282 (stone -> heart, 2 Cor 3:3)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**
| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E005 (Deu 4:13) | Plain | Directly identifies covenant terms as Ten Commandments |
| E275 (Heb 8:13) | Ambiguous | "The first" is vanishing -- but what specifically? The neuter participles do not agree with diathēkē (feminine). Context (Heb 9:1) specifies "ordinances of divine service" as the first covenant's content. |
| E039 (Heb 8:10) | Plain | Directly states "my laws" will be on hearts -- same chapter as E275 |
| E274 (Heb 8:8) | Plain | Directly states fault with "them" (autous, masculine accusative) |
| E276 (Heb 9:1) | Contextually Clear | Specifies what the first covenant had: sanctuary, service |
| E136 (Heb 9:10) | Plain | Directly calls them "carnal ordinances, imposed until time of reformation" |
| N044 | Contextually Clear | Observable structure of Heb 10:1-17 |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR Abolished: One Plain (E005) + One Ambiguous (E275). AGAINST Abolished: Three Plain (E039, E274, E136) + Two Contextually Clear (E276, N044). The weight favors AGAINST.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The plain statements in the SAME chapter (Heb 8:8, 10) and immediate context (Heb 9:1, 10) interpret the ambiguous one (Heb 8:13). Heb 8:8 identifies the fault as with the people; Heb 8:10 identifies the new covenant content as "my laws" on hearts; Heb 9:1-10 specifies the first covenant's practical elements as ceremonial. The ambiguous "vanishing" is governed by these clearer statements: what vanishes is the old covenant's ceremonial administration, not its moral law content, which is being relocated to hearts.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong against Abolished.**
Plain statements on the Continues side (fault with people, my laws on hearts, carnal ordinances specified) with only Ambiguous support for the Abolished reading (Heb 8:13 without context).

---

#### I-B Resolution: I3/I046 -- 2 Cor 3:7-11 abolishes the Decalogue

*(This I-B was already resolved in law-08. Summary here.)*

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (Abolished): E283 (ministration of death, written in stones), 2 Cor 3:11 "done away"
- AGAINST: E251 (katargoumenēn feminine agrees with doxan/glory, not nomos), N041 (what is done away is the glory), E010 (law is holy/just/good), E011 (law is spiritual), E025 (we establish the law)

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong against Abolished.**
Same author calls the law holy/just/good/spiritual (Rom 7:12, 14); the grammar (feminine participle = glory) is a lexical fact. *(Full resolution in law-08.)*

---

#### I-B Resolution: I4/I059 -- Gal 4:24-25 = Sinai covenant is bondage including moral law

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (Abolished): E292 (Sinai gendereth to bondage)
- AGAINST: E292 itself (Paul calls it "an allegory"), E010 (law holy/just/good), E011 (law spiritual), E025 (we establish the law), E143 (keeping commandments of God matters)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**
| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E292 (Gal 4:24) | Ambiguous | Paul himself labels it allegory; allegorical genre requires careful interpretation |
| E010 (Rom 7:12) | Plain | Direct didactic statement about the law's character |
| E025 (Rom 3:31) | Plain | Direct denial of law abolition |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: One Ambiguous (allegory). AGAINST: Two Plain didactic statements from the same author.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
Paul's plain didactic statements (Rom 7:12; 3:31) govern the reading of his allegorical passage. The allegory addresses the PRINCIPLE of works-righteousness vs. promise, not the abolition of the law's content.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong against Abolished.**
Allegorical passage vs. plain didactic statements from the same author.

---

#### I-B Resolution: I5/I060 -- Gal 3:19 = law was temporary

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (Abolished): Gal 3:19 "added...till the seed should come"
- AGAINST: E021 (Mat 5:17-18: "till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law"), E025 (Rom 3:31: we establish the law), E034 (Gen 26:5: commandments before Sinai), E014-E019 (Psalms: law is forever, endures, everlasting)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**
| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Gal 3:19 | Contextually Clear | Requires understanding what "added" and "till the seed" modify -- the law itself or its function |
| E021 (Mat 5:17-18) | Plain | Jesus directly states nothing passes from the law till heaven and earth pass |
| E025 (Rom 3:31) | Plain | Direct denial of law-voiding |
| E014 (Psa 111:7-8) | Plain | "They stand fast for ever and ever" |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: One Contextually Clear. AGAINST: Multiple Plain statements (Jesus' own words, Paul's own words, Psalms).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
Jesus' plain statement (Mat 5:17-18) and Paul's own denial (Rom 3:31) govern the reading of Gal 3:19. What was "added till the seed" was the law's condemning/custodial function (Gal 3:24-25: "schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ"), not the law itself.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong against Abolished.**
Multiple Plain statements (including Jesus' direct teaching) vs. one Contextually Clear passage whose own context (Gal 3:21, 24-25) narrows the temporal reference to function, not existence.

### 4. Verification Phase

**Step A (E-statements verified):** Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases verse text. Checked.

**Step A2 (E-positional classifications verified):** All Continues E-items passed the 4-gate validation. All Neutral E-items failed V1 and V2 (no continuation or cessation vocabulary applying to moral law specifically).

**Step B (N-items verified):**
- N1/N049: Would an Abolished scholar agree Deu 4:13-14 separates covenant terms from statutes/judgments? Yes -- the text makes this separation in consecutive verses. No interpretation required. Verified N.
- N2/N050: Would an Abolished scholar agree the texts identify fault with the people? Yes -- autous is grammatically unambiguous. Verified N. (Classified Neutral because both sides accept this observation.)
- N3/N051: Would an Abolished scholar agree that "torati" / "nomous mou" uses a possessive pronoun? Yes -- lexical fact. Whether this means the SAME law or "my kind of law" is a separate question, but the possessive form is undeniable. Verified N.
- N4/N044: Already verified in law-08.
- N5/N052: Would an Abolished scholar agree the text specifies these five changes (location, power, mediator, blood, forgiveness)? Yes -- each is directly stated. Whether the law content ALSO changes is the inference question, but these five are textually specified. Verified N.

**Step C-D (I-items verified):**
- I1/I057: Source test -- all components in E/N tables. Direction -- no E/N redefined. I-A confirmed.
- I2/I058: Source test -- text-derived. Direction -- requires E039 to not mean what it says (or E275 to override E039). I-B confirmed.
- I3/I046: Already verified in law-08. I-B confirmed.
- I4/I059: Source test -- text-derived. Direction -- requires allegorical passage to override didactic. I-B confirmed.
- I5/I060: Source test -- text-derived. Direction -- requires Gal 3:19 to override Mat 5:17-18. I-B confirmed.
- I6/I061: Source test -- all components in E/N tables. Direction -- no E/N redefined. I-A confirmed.
- I7/I062: Source test -- all components in E/N tables. Direction -- no E/N redefined. I-A confirmed.

**Step E (Consistency checks):**
- I-A items (I057, I061, I062): Only require criterion #5. Confirmed.
- I-B items (I058, I046, I059, I060): Each has E/N on both sides. Confirmed.

### 7. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

**What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):**

- The old covenant's terms were the Ten Commandments (Deu 4:13; Exo 34:28; Deu 9:9, 11)
- The old covenant was ratified by animal blood (Exo 24:8)
- Israel accepted the covenant based on their own promise: "we will do" (Exo 19:8; 24:3, 7)
- The people broke the covenant (Jer 31:32; Heb 8:9)
- The fault was with the people, not the law (Heb 8:8: autous; Rom 8:3: weak through the flesh)
- God promised a new covenant that writes "my law/my laws" (torati/nomous mou) on hearts (Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10; 10:16)
- The possessive pronoun ("my") identifies the law as God's pre-existing law
- The Spirit causes obedience to the same statutes and judgments (Eze 36:27)
- Christ is the mediator of the new/better covenant (Heb 8:6; 9:15; 12:24)
- The new covenant is ratified by Christ's blood (Mat 26:28; Heb 9:12; 13:20)
- The first covenant's practical content included "ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary" (Heb 9:1), consisting of "meats, drinks, washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation" (Heb 9:10)
- Hebrews 10:1-17 removes the sacrificial system while affirming "my laws" on hearts in the same argument
- The five textually specified differences between old and new covenants are: location (stone -> heart), power (human promise -> God's action + Spirit), mediator (Moses -> Christ), blood (animal -> Christ's), forgiveness ("I will remember their sin no more")
- Paul says "we establish the law" through faith (Rom 3:31)
- The Spirit enables fulfillment of the law's righteousness in believers (Rom 8:4)
- The new covenant is called "the everlasting covenant" (Heb 13:20)

**What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):**

- Scripture does not explicitly state "the Decalogue is abolished in the new covenant" -- no new covenant text says this
- Scripture does not explicitly state "the new covenant has a different set of moral commands" -- every new covenant text says "my law/my laws"
- Scripture does not explicitly state that Hebrews 8:13's "vanishing" refers to the moral law -- the context specifies ceremonial elements
- Scripture does not explicitly state that 2 Corinthians 3's "done away" is the law itself -- the grammar identifies the glory as what is done away
- Scripture does not explicitly state that the "bondage" of Galatians 4:24 is the moral law's content -- Paul labels this an allegory and elsewhere calls the law holy/just/good/spiritual
- Scripture does not explicitly state "the law of the new covenant is different from the law of the old covenant"
- Neither side can claim the other's position is explicitly stated; the Abolished reading at every point requires inference beyond what the text states

## Conclusion

The textual evidence consistently identifies the old covenant as the Sinai arrangement in which God proposed terms (the Ten Commandments), Israel accepted by human promise ("we will do"), and the covenant was ratified with animal blood. The new covenant, prophesied by Jeremiah and expounded in Hebrews, writes the SAME law ("my torah" / "my laws") on hearts with Christ as mediator, His blood as ratification, the Holy Spirit as enabling power, and complete forgiveness as the basis.

Across 48 explicit observations in this study, 8 new E-items use law-continuation vocabulary applied to the moral law and pass the 4-gate validation as Continues. Zero new E-items use law-cessation vocabulary applied to the moral law. 21 new E-items are Neutral (factual observations both sides accept, or ceremonial cessation which is common ground). 4 new N-items follow unavoidably from E-items (3 Continues, 1 Neutral). 6 new I-items include 3 I-A (Evidence-Extending, all Continues) and 3 I-B (Competing-Evidence, all Abolished, all resolved Strong against the Abolished reading by SIS). No new Abolished items at E or N tier were found. All Abolished claims in this study are at the inference level and are resolved by the SIS protocol against the Abolished reading.

The old/new covenant transition text itself provides evidence that the Bible distinguishes between categories of law: the ceremonial system is what the old covenant arrangement consisted of in practice (Heb 9:1-10), and it is removed; the moral law ("my laws") is the content of the new covenant written on hearts (Heb 8:10; 10:16). The same author (Hebrews) removes the ceremonial in one paragraph and affirms the moral in the next, without contradiction.
