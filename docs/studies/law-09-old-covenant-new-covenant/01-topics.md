## Question
What is the Old Covenant and what is the New Covenant? Investigate the Sinai covenant formation (Exo 19-24): God proposes, Israel accepts, the terms are the Ten Commandments (Deu 4:13), and the covenant is ratified by blood (Exo 24:3-8). Examine Jeremiah 31:31-34 and Hebrews 8:6-13. What exactly is "old" -- the law itself or the arrangement/administration? Is the difference between the old and new covenants the CONTENT of the law, or the LOCATION/POWER/MEDIATOR/BASIS? Does the new covenant abolish God's moral law, or does it write the same law on hearts?
