# Bible Study: What Is the Old Covenant and What Is the New Covenant?

## Question

What is the Old Covenant and what is the New Covenant? Investigate the Sinai covenant formation (Exo 19-24): God proposes, Israel accepts, the terms are the Ten Commandments (Deu 4:13), and the covenant is ratified by blood (Exo 24:3-8). Examine Jeremiah 31:31-34 and Hebrews 8:6-13. What exactly is "old" -- the law itself or the arrangement/administration? Is the difference between the old and new covenants the CONTENT of the law, or the LOCATION/POWER/MEDIATOR/BASIS? Does the new covenant abolish God's moral law, or does it write the same law on hearts?

## Methodology

This study is part of the Law of God series. Apply the following methodology:

```
INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by those who say the law continues, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by those who say the law is abolished, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says. Do not use editorial characterizations like "genuine tension," "strongest argument," "most significant challenge," "honestly acknowledge," or "non-intuitive reading." Simply state what each passage says and what each side infers from it.
- When presenting findings, state: "The text says X" (explicit). Then state: "From this, Y interpretation infers Z" and "W interpretation infers V" (inferred).
- Never use language like "irrefutable," "obviously," or "clearly proves." Use "the text states," "this is consistent with."
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.

## Prior Study Conclusions

Read ALL of the following before beginning research. These establish the cumulative evidence base:

1. `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-01-gods-moral-law/CONCLUSION.md` -- God's moral law (Decalogue): 7 unique markers, attributes mirror God's character, law on hearts in new covenant
2. `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-02-law-before-sinai/CONCLUSION.md` -- Law before Sinai: moral law operated from creation; Sabbath at creation; Abraham kept commandments
3. `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-03-exodus-20-vs-later-laws/CONCLUSION.md` -- Exodus 20 vs. later laws: five dimensions of distinction between Decalogue and subsequent legislation
4. `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-04-ceremonial-laws/CONCLUSION.md` -- Ceremonial laws: five categories; shadow/type vocabulary exclusively ceremonial
5. `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-05-civil-judicial-laws/CONCLUSION.md` -- Civil/judicial laws: mishpatim as case-law applications of Decalogue moral principles; NT transfers judicial function to government/church
6. `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-06-hebrew-law-vocabulary/CONCLUSION.md` -- Hebrew law vocabulary: terms describe formal character, not moral category; eduth has unique Decalogue association
7. `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-07-law-of-moses/CONCLUSION.md` -- "Law of Moses": comprehensive Pentateuchal legislation; "law of God"/"law of the LORD" interchangeable as labels; Paul's "law of God" in Rom 7-8 = Decalogue specifically
8. `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-08-abolished-at-cross/CONCLUSION.md` -- Abolished at the cross: seven NT abolition passages; none explicitly names the Decalogue as abolished; Greek vocabulary in each passage specifies ceremonial referent; dogma never used for Decalogue; cheirographon = hand-written (Decalogue was God-written); 2 Cor 3:7 grammar: feminine participle agrees with "glory," not "law"

### Related Existing Studies

| Study | Score | Relevance |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| old-covenant-new-covenant | 0.680 | Directly related prior study -- investigated the old/new covenant definitions; found the law does not change between covenants; the LOCATION, POWER, MEDIATOR, and BASIS change |
| covenant-relationship-to-law | 0.563 | Investigated whether the new covenant abolishes God's moral law; found the new covenant ESTABLISHES the moral law by writing it on hearts through the Holy Spirit |

**Key findings from related studies:**

The existing `old-covenant-new-covenant` study (non-series, pre-methodology) concluded:
- Old covenant = bilateral agreement at Sinai, founded on Israel's promise ("we will do")
- Covenant terms = Ten Commandments (Deu 4:13; Exo 34:28)
- Ratified by ox blood (Exo 24:8)
- "Fault" was with the PEOPLE, not the law (Heb 8:8, Greek memphomenos autous)
- New covenant = God's promise to write the SAME law on hearts (Jer 31:33)
- The law does not change between covenants; the LOCATION, POWER, MEDIATOR, and BASIS change

The existing `covenant-relationship-to-law` study (non-series, pre-methodology) concluded:
- New covenant does NOT abolish God's moral law -- it writes the SAME law (torah/nomos) on hearts
- Jer 31:33 uses torah (H8451); Heb 8:10/10:16 uses nomos (G3551) -- the standard terms
- Eze 36:27 confirms the Spirit causes obedience to the SAME statutes (chuqqot) and judgments (mishpatim)
- Rom 3:31: faith establishes (histemi) the law
- Rom 8:4: the law's righteous requirement is fulfilled in us through the Spirit
- Heb 10:16 occurs WITHIN the passage that terminates the ceremonial system (vv.1-9), showing ceremonial ends while moral continues

**IMPORTANT:** These prior studies were conducted BEFORE the law-series methodology was developed. They do NOT use the Evidence Classification system (E/N/I tiers), the Decision Trees, or the SIS principle. This study (law-09) must re-examine all the same material using the full methodology, including positional classification of every evidence item through the Decision Trees. The prior studies provide useful reference but their conclusions must be independently verified through the methodology.

### Focus Areas

The following focus areas are derived from tool discoveries, not from training knowledge:

1. **Covenant formation and structure (Exo 19-24):** The Nave's COVENANT entry identifies the Sinai covenant with specific sub-categories (Sacred, Binding, Blood of, Book of). Investigate the bilateral structure: God proposes (Exo 19:5-6), Israel accepts (Exo 19:8; 24:3,7), terms defined (Deu 4:13 = Ten Commandments), blood ratification (Exo 24:5-8). Use [H1285](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1285/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (berith) and [H3772](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3772/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (karath, "cut a covenant") to trace covenant-making vocabulary.

2. **The "second covenant" / new covenant texts (Jer 31:31-34; Heb 8:4-13; 12:18-24; 13:20):** The Nave's COVENANT entry explicitly lists these under "THE SECOND COVENANT." Investigate what is promised in the new covenant: law on hearts (Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10; 10:16), knowledge of God (Jer 31:34), forgiveness of sins (Jer 31:34; Heb 8:12). Use [G1242](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1242/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (diatheke) to trace the NT covenant terminology.

3. **Mediator and surety vocabulary (G3316 mesites; [G1450](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1450/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} engyos):** Heb 8:6 calls Jesus "the mediator of a better covenant, established upon better promises." Heb 7:22 calls Jesus "surety" (engyos) of a better testament. Investigate the mediator contrast: Moses as mediator of old covenant vs. Christ as mediator of new covenant. How does the change of mediator relate to the change of covenant?

4. **Blood of covenant ratification (H5137 nazah; [G4473](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4473/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} rhantismos; [G129](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g129/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} haima):** Exo 24:5-8 (ox blood sprinkled on people); Heb 9:18-20 (the first testament dedicated with blood); Heb 12:24 ("blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel"); Heb 13:20 ("the blood of the everlasting covenant"). Investigate the blood continuity/contrast between old and new covenants.

5. **"Made old" / "vanish away" vocabulary (G3822 palaioo; [G854](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g854/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} aphanismos):** Heb 8:13 uses palaioo ("he hath made the first old") and aphanismos ("ready to vanish away"). What exactly is "old" and "vanishing"? Is it the law itself, or the covenant arrangement/administration? The prior studies found the "fault" was with the people (Heb 8:8), not the law.

6. **Law written on hearts vocabulary (G1449 engrapho; [H3824](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3824/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} lebab; [G2588](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2588/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} kardia):** Jer 31:33 promises law in "inward parts" (lebab/qereb); Heb 8:10/10:16 uses kardia (heart) and dianoia (mind); 2 Cor 3:3 uses engrapho (inscribe). Investigate what is written on hearts -- is it the same law that was on stone, or a different law? Eze 36:26-27 promises a "new heart" and the Spirit causes obedience to the same statutes/judgments.

7. **Heart renewal texts (from Nave's HEART-RENEWED):** Deu 30:6; Psa 51:10; Eze 11:19; 18:31; 36:26; Rom 2:29; Eph 4:23; Col 3:10. These passages describe the internal transformation that the new covenant accomplishes. Do they confirm that the law's content remains the same while the heart's condition changes?

8. **Heb 8:6 "better covenant" / "better promises" (G1860 epangelia):** What are the "better promises" of the new covenant? Are they better because the LAW is different, or because the BASIS is different (God's promise vs. human promise)?

9. **The contrast between Sinai and new covenant (Heb 12:18-24):** The Nave's entry lists this passage under THE SECOND COVENANT. The passage contrasts "the mount that might be touched" (Sinai) with "mount Sion, the heavenly Jerusalem." Investigate what the contrast is about -- different law or different administration?

10. **Relationship to abolition passages (from law-08):** Law-08 established that none of the seven NT abolition passages names the Decalogue as abolished. How does this finding relate to the old/new covenant transition? If the covenant terms are the Ten Commandments (Deu 4:13), and the new covenant writes the same law on hearts (Jer 31:33), then the covenant transition is not about abolishing the moral law.

   - `01-topics.md` -- Nave's topics and full entries
   - `02-verses.md` -- All verse texts retrieved with context
   - `04-word-studies.md` -- Strong's research for all covenant/heart/blood vocabulary
   - `raw-data/` -- Raw tool output organized by category
8. Do NOT write `03-analysis.md` or `CONCLUSION.md` -- those are for the analysis agent

**Platform notes:**
- Tools are at `D:/bible/tools/`; use subdirectories as needed (`D:/bible/tools/search/`, `D:/bible/tools/strongs/`, etc.)
- Use `python` directly (no venv activation needed)
- Windows paths with forward slashes
