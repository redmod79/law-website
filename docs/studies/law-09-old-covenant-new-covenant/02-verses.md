### C. NEW COVENANT NT EXPOSITION

#### Hebrews 8:1-13 (Better Covenant, Better Promises, First Made Old)
> **8:1** Now of the things which we have spoken [this is] the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
> **8:2** A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
> **8:3** For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore [it is] of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
> **8:4** For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
> **8:5** Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, [that] thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
> **8:6** But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
> **8:7** For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
> **8:8** For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
> **8:9** Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
> **8:10** For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
> **8:11** And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
> **8:12** For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
> **8:13** In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old [is] ready to vanish away.

#### Hebrews 9:1-28 (First Covenant Ordinances; Blood of New Covenant)
> **9:1** Then verily the first [covenant] had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
> **9:2-5** [Description of the tabernacle furnishings]
> **9:6** Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service [of God].
> **9:7** But into the second [went] the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and [for] the errors of the people:
> **9:8** The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:
> **9:9** Which [was] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
> **9:10** [Which stood] only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed [on them] until the time of reformation.
> **9:11** But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
> **9:12** Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption [for us].
> **9:13** For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:
> **9:14** How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
> **9:15** And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions [that were] under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
> **9:16** For where a testament [is], there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.
> **9:17** For a testament [is] of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.
> **9:18** Whereupon neither the first [testament] was dedicated without blood.
> **9:19** For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,
> **9:20** Saying, This [is] the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.
> **9:21-28** [Christ's superior sacrifice; entered heaven itself; offered once for all]

#### Hebrews 10:1-18 (Sacrifices Removed; Law on Hearts)
> **10:1** For the law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
> **10:2-4** [Sacrifices could not take away sins]
> **10:5** Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:
> **10:6-8** [Burnt offerings for sin had no pleasure; offered by the law]
> **10:9** Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
> **10:10** By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once [for all].
> **10:11-14** [One sacrifice for sins forever]
> **10:15** [Whereof] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
> **10:16** This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
> **10:17** And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
> **10:18** Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for sin.
> **10:29** ... who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?

#### Hebrews 12:18-24 (Sinai vs. Sion Contrast)
> **12:18** For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
> **12:19** And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which [voice] they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:
> **12:20** (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:
> **12:21** And so terrible was the sight, [that] Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)
> **12:22** But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
> **12:23** To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
> **12:24** And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than [that of] Abel.

#### Hebrews 13:20 (Blood of the Everlasting Covenant)
> **13:20** Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,

#### Hebrews 7:22 (Jesus Surety of a Better Testament)
> **7:22** By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.

#### 2 Corinthians 3:1-18 (Letter vs. Spirit; Glory of Old vs. New)
> **3:1** Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some [others], epistles of commendation to you, or [letters] of commendation from you?
> **3:2** Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:
> **3:3** [Forasmuch as ye are] manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
> **3:4** And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
> **3:5** Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency [is] of God;
> **3:6** Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
> **3:7** But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away:
> **3:8** How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
> **3:9** For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
> **3:10** For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
> **3:11** For if that which is done away [was] glorious, much more that which remaineth [is] glorious.
> **3:12** Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
> **3:13** And not as Moses, [which] put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:
> **3:14** But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which [vail] is done away in Christ.
> **3:15** But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.
> **3:16** Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
> **3:17** Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.
> **3:18** But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.

#### Galatians 3:15-22 (Covenant Cannot Be Disannulled; Promise to Abraham)
> **3:15** Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though [it be] but a man's covenant, yet [if it be] confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.
> **3:16** Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
> **3:17** And this I say, [that] the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.
> **3:18** For if the inheritance [be] of the law, [it is] no more of promise: but God gave [it] to Abraham by promise.
> **3:19** Wherefore then [serveth] the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
> **3:20** Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one.
> **3:21** [Is] the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.
> **3:22** But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.

#### Galatians 4:21-31 (Two Covenants Allegory)
> **4:21** Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
> **4:22** For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.
> **4:23** But he [who was] of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman [was] by promise.
> **4:24** Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
> **4:25** For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
> **4:26** But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
> **4:27** For it is written, Rejoice, [thou] barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.
> **4:28** Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
> **4:29** But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit, even so [it is] now.
> **4:30** Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
> **4:31** So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.

#### Lord's Supper / New Testament in Blood
> **Matthew 26:28** For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
> **Mark 14:24** And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.
> **Luke 22:20** Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup [is] the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
> **1 Corinthians 11:25** After the same manner also [he took] the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink [it], in remembrance of me.

### D. HEART RENEWAL AND TRANSFORMATION

#### Psalm 51:10 (Create in Me a Clean Heart)
> **51:10** Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.

#### Psalm 40:8 (Thy Law Within My Heart)
> **40:8** I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law [is] within my heart.

#### Romans 2:14-15, 29 (Law Written in Hearts; Circumcision of Heart)
> **2:14** For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
> **2:15** Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and [their] thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
> **2:29** But he [is] a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision [is that] of the heart, in the spirit, [and] not in the letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God.
