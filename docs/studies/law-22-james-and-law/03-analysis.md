# law-22 Analysis: James and the Law

## Methodology

This analysis examines all three James law-passage clusters (Jas 1:22-25, 2:1-13, 4:11-12) as a unified teaching, determining what James says about the law, what law he identifies by name and content, and what his distinctive vocabulary reveals. Prior studies cited individual James verses as supporting evidence; this study treats James' law theology comprehensively.

INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says.
- When presenting findings, state: "The text says X" (explicit). Then state: "From this, Y interpretation infers Z."
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.

## I. Passage Cluster 1: The Perfect Law of Liberty (Jas 1:22-27)

### A. The Text

> **1:22** But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
> **1:23** For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
> **1:24** For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
> **1:25** But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
> **1:26** If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.
> **1:27** Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.

### B. Structural Observations

James constructs a parallel between vv. 22-24 and v. 25:

| Element | vv. 22-24 (Negative Example) | v. 25 (Positive Example) |
|---------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Object looked at | "the word" (ton logon, v. 22) | "the perfect law of liberty" (nomon teleion ton tes eleutherias) |
| Type of looking | "beholding" (katanoounti, v. 23) | "looketh into" (parakupsas) |
| Response | goes away, forgets | "continueth therein" (parameinas) |
| Posture | "hearer only" (akroates monon) | "not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work" |
| Result | self-deception (v. 22) | "shall be blessed in his deed" |

**The text identifies "the word" (vv. 22-24) with "the perfect law of liberty" (v. 25).** The transition from logos to nomos within the same pericope, using parallel structure, establishes that James treats these as the same referent -- God's revealed instruction.

### C. Key Vocabulary Analysis

**1. parakupsas (G3879) -- "looketh into"**

The text says James uses parakupto, which means "to stoop down and peer intently into." This verb appears 5 times in the NT:
- Luk 24:12 -- Peter stooping to look into the empty tomb
- Jhn 20:5 -- The beloved disciple stooping to look into the tomb
- Jhn 20:11 -- Mary stooping to look into the tomb
- Jas 1:25 -- Looking into the perfect law of liberty
- 1 Pet 1:12 -- Angels desiring to look into salvation mysteries

The text uses a verb denoting intense, investigative examination -- not a casual glance. The aorist participle (parakupsas) indicates an act of careful looking that precedes and conditions the main verb estai ("shall be blessed").

**2. nomon teleion (G3551 + G5046) -- "perfect law"**

The text says the law is teleion ("perfect, complete, mature"). James uses teleios 4 times in his epistle:
- 1:4 -- "let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire"
- 1:17 -- "every perfect gift is from above"
- 1:25 -- "the perfect law of liberty"
- 3:2 -- "a perfect man"

For James, teleios consistently means "complete, lacking nothing." In 1:17, "every perfect gift" comes "from the Father of lights." In 1:25, "the perfect law" carries the same quality -- it is complete and from God.

The OT parallel is Psa 19:7: "The law of the LORD is perfect (H8549 tamim), converting the soul." The Hebrew tamim means "complete, whole, without blemish." The LXX uses amomos (blameless) rather than teleios, but the concept is identical: the law lacks nothing, is without deficiency.

**3. ton tes eleutherias (G1657) -- "of liberty"**

The text says the law is "of liberty" (tes eleutherias, genitive of quality -- the law characterized by liberty). James is the only NT writer to pair eleutheria with nomos. This construction appears twice in James (1:25; 2:12) and nowhere else.

The OT background includes Psa 119:45: "And I will walk at liberty (H7342 barchavah): for I seek thy precepts." The Psalmist experiences liberty BECAUSE he seeks God's precepts -- the law is the instrument of liberty, not its obstacle.

**4. parameinas (G3887) -- "continueth therein"**

The text says the person who is blessed is the one who "continueth" (parameinas, aorist participle of parameno, "to remain beside, to abide"). This verb indicates ongoing, sustained engagement with the law -- not a one-time encounter. The present ongoing relationship with the law is a condition of the blessing.

**5. poietes ergou (G4163 + G2041) -- "a doer of the work"**

The text sets up a binary: a person is either a "forgetful hearer" (akroates epilesmones) or a "doer of the work" (poietes ergou). This parallels Rom 2:13: "not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified." Both James and Paul use the same hearer/doer distinction with the same vocabulary (akroates/poietes).

### D. The Mirror Metaphor (vv. 23-25)

The text says a person who hears the word but does not do it is "like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass" (esoptron, [G2072](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2072/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, "mirror"). He sees himself, goes away, and "straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was."

The metaphor establishes the law's REVELATORY function: the law shows a person what they truly are ("his natural face" -- to prosopon tes geneseos, literally "the face of origin/birth"). This parallels Rom 7:7: "I had not known sin, but by the law." The law reveals sin. The person who merely glances and walks away gains nothing. The person who "looks intently into the perfect law of liberty and continues therein" is blessed.

### E. Context: vv. 26-27

The text transitions from the law to "pure religion": visiting the fatherless and widows and keeping oneself unspotted from the world. These are moral duties -- care for the vulnerable (Exo 22:22-24; Deu 14:29; 24:17-21) and separation from sin. The law's content, as James describes its practical outworking, is moral.

## II. Passage Cluster 2: The Royal Law and the Law of Liberty (Jas 2:1-13)

### A. The Text

> **2:1** My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.
> **2:2-4** [Example of partiality between rich and poor in the assembly]
> **2:5** Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
> **2:8** If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
> **2:9** But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
> **2:10** For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.
> **2:11** For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
> **2:12** So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
> **2:13** For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

### B. The Royal Law (v. 8)

**1. nomon basilikon (G937) -- "the royal law"**

The text says James calls this the "royal law" (nomon basilikon). Basilikos means "pertaining to a king" (from basileus, "king"). Its 5 NT occurrences are:
- Jhn 4:46,49 -- "nobleman" (one belonging to a king's court)
- Acts 12:20 -- "the king's country"
- Acts 12:21 -- "royal apparel"
- Jas 2:8 -- "the royal law"

The word means "belonging to the king." Applied to law, it designates the law as belonging to the King (God). The text connects this to "heirs of the kingdom" (Jas 2:5) -- the royal law governs the kingdom God has promised.

**2. kata ten graphen (G1124) -- "according to the scripture"**

The text says James identifies this royal law "according to the scripture" -- then quotes Lev 19:18: "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." James locates his "royal law" in the OT scriptures, specifically in the Leviticus passage that Jesus also identified as the second great commandment (Mat 22:39; Mar 12:31).

**3. The verb teleite (G5055) -- "ye fulfil"**

The text uses teleo (G5055), meaning "to complete, carry out to the end, fulfil." This is present active indicative, indicating ongoing action. The conditional structure (ei mentoi...teleite) is: "If indeed you are fulfilling the royal law...you do well." The law is something to be actively fulfilled.

### C. Partiality as Sin Against the Law (v. 9)

The text says: "But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin (hamartian ergazesthe), and are convinced of the law (tou nomou) as transgressors (parabatai)."

Three observations:
1. Partiality is identified as "sin" (hamartia).
2. The law convicts (elegchomenoi, "being convicted/exposed") the offender.
3. The offender is a "transgressor" (parabates) of the law.

The OT background is Lev 19:15: "Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour." This prohibition against partiality appears in the same chapter as the love command James quotes (Lev 19:18). James does not distinguish between the love command and the partiality prohibition -- both belong to the same law.

### D. The Wholeness and Indivisibility of the Law (vv. 10-11)

**Verse 10:** "For whosoever shall keep the whole law (holon ton nomon), and yet offend (ptaise) in one point (en heni), he is guilty of all (panton enochos)."

The text says:
- The law is a "whole" (holon, "entire, complete")
- Stumbling in "one" (heni) makes one "guilty of all" (panton enochos)
- The perfect tense gegonen ("has become and remains") indicates a present state of guilt

**Verse 11:** "For he that said (ho eipon), Do not commit adultery (me moicheuses), said also (eipen kai), Do not kill (me phoneuses). Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law (parabates nomou)."

The text says:
1. **"He that said" (ho eipon):** This identifies a SINGLE speaker who gave BOTH commands. The "he" is God, who directly spoke the Ten Commandments (Exo 20:1; Deu 5:4,22).
2. **"Said also" (eipen kai):** The SAME speaker gave both the 7th commandment (Exo 20:14) and the 6th commandment (Exo 20:13).
3. **The two commands cited are both from the Decalogue:** "Do not commit adultery" = 7th commandment; "Do not kill" = 6th commandment. James does not cite ceremonial or civil commands as his illustration.
4. **The conclusion:** Violating EITHER command makes one a "transgressor of the law" (parabates nomou).

The argument's logic is: the unity of the law rests on the unity of its Speaker. Because ONE God spoke all the commandments, violating any one is an offense against the Lawgiver and thus against the entire law. James grounds the law's indivisibility in the identity of the Lawgiver, not in the law's content being identical across all parts.

**What "the whole law" refers to in context:**

The text's immediate context determines the scope of "the whole law." James has just cited the love-your-neighbor command from Lev 19:18 (v. 8) and is about to cite two Decalogue commands -- the 6th and 7th (v. 11). No ceremonial or civil laws are cited, referenced, or alluded to in this passage. The "whole law" that James illustrates with Decalogue commands is the moral law.

From this, the Continues position infers that James' "whole law" refers to the Decalogue/moral law specifically, and the indivisibility applies to the moral law as a unified code.

From this, the Abolished position infers that James' "whole law" includes all of the Torah, and the indivisibility shows the law is one undivided body -- if any is abolished, all is abolished.

The text itself does not explicitly state which of these readings is correct. However, the immediate illustration uses only Decalogue commands, and the broader passage (2:8-12) identifies the law by its Decalogue content.

### E. The Law of Liberty as Judgment Standard (v. 12)

The text says: "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged (krinesthai, present passive infinitive) by the law of liberty (dia nomou eleutherias)."

Observations:
1. **Imperative commands:** laleite ("speak!") and poieite ("do!") are both present active imperatives -- ongoing commands to speak and act in conformity with the law.
2. **Future judgment:** mellontes krinesthai ("being about to be judged") -- the judgment is future but certain.
3. **The standard:** The law of liberty is the standard BY WHICH (dia) believers will be judged.
4. **Same "law of liberty":** This is the same "law of liberty" as 1:25, now identified by its content: the royal law (love your neighbor, Lev 19:18) and the Decalogue (7th and 6th commandments).

The text presents the law of liberty as an active, binding, future-oriented standard of judgment. It is not a past institution but a present obligation and future criterion.

### F. Mercy and Judgment (v. 13)

The text says: "For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment."

This verse connects the law of liberty to mercy. The law of liberty is not merely a legal code but includes mercy as a central principle. The judgment will be tempered by mercy for those who show mercy. This is consistent with Jesus' teaching: "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy" (Mat 5:7) and "With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again" (Mat 7:2).

## III. Passage Cluster 3: Judging the Law (Jas 4:11-12)

### A. The Text

> **4:11** Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
> **4:12** There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?

### B. The Logical Chain in v. 11

James constructs a four-link chain:

1. **Speaking evil of a brother = speaking evil of the law.** The text says ho katalalon adelphou...katalaleite nomou. The verb katalaleo (G2635, "to speak against") appears 3 of its 5 NT occurrences in this single verse. James states that when one speaks against a brother, one is simultaneously speaking against the law.

2. **The logic:** The law commands love for neighbor/brother (Lev 19:18, cited by James in 2:8 as the "royal law"). When a person speaks evil of a brother, that person is acting contrary to the law's command. But James goes further: the person is not merely breaking the law -- the person is "speaking evil of" the law itself and "judging" the law. The person places themselves above the law, declaring by their actions that the law's command to love does not apply to them.

3. **Doer vs. Judge binary:** The text says: "If thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law (poietes nomou), but a judge (krites)." James presents a mutually exclusive binary:
   - A DOER of the law is one who obeys it, accepting its authority
   - A JUDGE of the law is one who evaluates it, placing themselves above it

4. **The underlying assumption:** This argument assumes the law is BINDING and AUTHORITATIVE. If the law were abolished, judging it would be meaningless. One cannot "judge" a law that is no longer in force. James' prohibition against judging the law presupposes the law's continuing authority.

### C. The One Lawgiver (v. 12)

**1. nomothetes (G3550) -- "lawgiver"**

The text says: "There is one lawgiver (heis estin nomothetes)." This is the ONLY occurrence of nomothetes in the NT (hapax legomenon). The compound nomos + tithemi means "one who establishes/places the law." James applies this exclusively to God.

The emphatic heis ("one") asserts exclusive divine legislative authority. There is ONE -- not many -- who has the right to establish law. This is consistent with Isa 33:22: "The LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us."

**2. kai krites -- "and judge"**

The text says the same ONE who is lawgiver is also "judge" (krites). This connects legislative authority with judicial authority -- the same God who GAVE the law will JUDGE by it.

**3. ho dunamenos sosai kai apolesai -- "who is able to save and to destroy"**

The text identifies the lawgiver/judge as the one "who is able to save and to destroy." This identifies the lawgiver/judge as God, who alone has power over ultimate destiny. Compare Mat 10:28: "Fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."

**4. su de tis ei -- "but who art thou?"**

The text concludes with a rhetorical question: "who art thou that judgest another (ton plesion)?" The word plesion ("neighbor") echoes 2:8 ("love thy neighbour"). James returns to the love command: the person who judges their neighbor violates the law that commands love.

### D. Connection Between the Three Passage Clusters

James' three law-passage clusters form a coherent, interconnected teaching:

| Element | 1:22-25 | 2:8-12 | 4:11-12 |
|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| Law designation | "the perfect law of liberty" | "the royal law" / "the law of liberty" | "the law" |
| Law's function | Reveals (mirror) | Convicts (transgressor) | Commands (doer) |
| Human posture | Look intently, continue, do | Fulfil, keep the whole law | Be a doer, not a judge |
| Source of authority | Implicit (God's word) | "He that said" (God) | "One lawgiver" (God) |
| Judgment theme | Blessing for the doer | "Judged by the law of liberty" | "Able to save and to destroy" |
| Content identified | Moral duties (vv. 26-27) | Lev 19:18 + Decalogue 6,7 | Love command (implied) |

---

## IV. What Law Does James Identify?

### A. James' Explicit Identifications

The text provides the following identifications of the law's content:

1. **Jas 2:8** quotes **Lev 19:18** ("Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself") as "the royal law according to the scripture."
2. **Jas 2:11** quotes **Exo 20:14** ("Do not commit adultery" -- 7th commandment) and **Exo 20:13** ("Do not kill" -- 6th commandment) as content of the law.
3. **Jas 2:11** identifies God as the direct speaker of both commands ("he that said...said also"), pointing to the Decalogue's unique characteristic: God spoke the Ten Commandments directly (Exo 20:1; Deu 5:4,22).
4. **Jas 1:26-27** identifies moral duties (bridling the tongue, caring for orphans/widows, keeping unspotted from the world) as practical outworkings of the law.
5. **Jas 4:11** identifies speaking evil of a brother as speaking evil of the law, connecting to the love command (2:8).

### B. What James Does NOT Identify as the Law

The text does not include in James' law-references:
- Ceremonial laws (sacrifices, feasts, purity regulations)
- Circumcision
- Dietary restrictions
- Temple/sanctuary service
- Sabbath (neither affirming nor denying)

James' law vocabulary exclusively references moral content: love of neighbor, the 6th and 7th commandments, care for the vulnerable, and personal holiness.

### C. Three Interpretations Examined

**Interpretation 1: The law of liberty = the Decalogue/moral law**

The text supports this with:
- Jas 2:11 cites two specific Decalogue commands as the law's content
- Jas 2:11 identifies God as the direct speaker ("he that said"), pointing to the Decalogue's unique origin
- Jas 1:25 calls the law "perfect" -- Psa 19:7 calls "the law of the LORD" perfect
- Jas 2:12 makes the law of liberty a judgment standard -- the Decalogue is the moral standard
- No ceremonial content is cited anywhere in James' law passages
- The "royal law" (Lev 19:18) is the love summary of the Decalogue's second table, as Jesus taught (Mat 22:39-40)

**Interpretation 2: The law of liberty = a "new law" or "law of Christ"**

The text does not support a completely new law because:
- James quotes OT scripture as the source: "according to the scripture" (kata ten graphen, 2:8) -- not a new revelation
- James identifies God as the speaker of specific Decalogue commands (2:11) -- the commands are OT, not new
- James calls it "the perfect law" and "the royal law" -- not "a new law"
- James never uses kainos ("new") for the law

However, the Continues position would note that this does not contradict a "law of Christ" understanding if "the law of Christ" IS the moral law as taught by Christ (cf. 1 Cor 9:21, "under the law to Christ"). In that case, the "newness" is not new content but a new administration.

**Interpretation 3: The law of liberty = the entire Torah internalized**

The text does not explicitly specify "Torah" or "Mosaic code" as the referent. The phrase "the whole law" (holon ton nomon, 2:10) could refer to the entire Torah, but the immediate illustration (2:11) uses only Decalogue commands. If James meant the entire Torah, his choice to illustrate exclusively with Decalogue commands -- never with ceremonial examples -- would require explanation.

---

## V. James' Distinctive Law Vocabulary

### A. Vocabulary Uniquely Used by James

| Term | Greek | Occurrences | Significance |
|------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| "perfect law" | nomon teleion | Jas 1:25 only | Found nowhere else in the NT |
| "law of liberty" | nomou eleutherias | Jas 1:25; 2:12 only | Found nowhere else in the NT |
| "royal law" | nomon basilikon | Jas 2:8 only | Found nowhere else in the NT |
| "one lawgiver" | heis nomothetes | Jas 4:12 only | Hapax legomenon in the NT |
| "doer of the law" | poietes nomou | Jas 4:11 only | Found nowhere else in the NT |

James employs five distinctive law designations that appear nowhere else in the NT. Each describes a positive attribute of the law: it is perfect (complete), liberating, royal (belonging to the King), given by one divine Lawgiver, and requiring "doers."

### B. Articular/Anarthrous Pattern

James uses nomos 10 times in 7 verses:
- With qualifiers (anarthrous but definite): 1:25 (perfect, of liberty), 2:8 (royal), 2:12 (of liberty)
- Articular: 2:9 (tou nomou), 2:10 (ton nomon), some uses in 4:11
- Anarthrous but definite by context: 2:11 (nomou), 4:11 (nomou)

The articular/anarthrous variation in James does not distinguish different laws. All uses in context refer to the same law -- the one whose content James identifies as the love command (Lev 19:18) and the Decalogue (Exo 20:13-14).

### C. James Never Uses entole

James uses nomos ("law") exclusively -- never entole ("commandment"). He speaks of the law as a unified whole, not of individual commandments in isolation. This is consistent with his "whole law" argument (2:10): the law is a seamless unity, and breaking one point breaks the whole.

---

## VI. Cross-References: James and Paul on Law and Liberty

### A. Shared Vocabulary

| Concept | James | Paul | Shared? |
|---------|-------|------|---------|
| Doers of the law | Jas 1:22-25; 4:11 | Rom 2:13 | Yes -- poietes/poietes nomou |
| Hearers of the law | Jas 1:22-25 | Rom 2:13 | Yes -- akroates |
| Transgressors of the law | Jas 2:9,11 (parabatai) | Rom 2:25,27; Gal 2:18 | Yes -- parabates |
| Love thy neighbour = Lev 19:18 | Jas 2:8 | Rom 13:9; Gal 5:14 | Yes -- same OT citation |
| Decalogue commands cited | Jas 2:11 (6th, 7th) | Rom 13:9 (7th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th) | Yes -- overlapping list |
| Liberty (eleutheria) | Jas 1:25; 2:12 | Gal 2:4; 5:1,13; 2 Cor 3:17 | Yes -- same Greek word |
| Law fulfillment | Jas 2:8 (teleite) | Rom 13:8 (pepleroken); Gal 5:14 (pepleroetai) | Yes -- same concept, different verbs |

### B. Apparent Difference in Law-Liberty Relationship

James pairs liberty WITH the law: the law IS "of liberty" (1:25; 2:12). The law itself brings freedom.

Paul pairs liberty with freedom FROM the law's condemning/cursing function: "the law of the Spirit of life...hath made me free from the law of sin and death" (Rom 8:2); "Stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free" (Gal 5:1).

The text does not present these as contradictory: James speaks of the law's liberating function when obeyed ("the perfect law of liberty...doer of the work...blessed"); Paul speaks of freedom from the law's penalty and condemnation ("there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus," Rom 8:1). Both affirm the law's ongoing moral authority; the perspectives differ on which aspect of the law-liberty relationship they emphasize.

### C. Paul's Parallel to James' "Royal Law"

Paul in Rom 13:8-10 and Gal 5:14 quotes the same Lev 19:18 command that James calls "the royal law." Paul says "all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (Gal 5:14). Paul then lists Decalogue commands as the content that love fulfills (Rom 13:9). This is the same structure as James: the love command summarizes the Decalogue, and both are operative.

---

## VII. James' Law Theology in His Broader Epistle

### A. Audience (Jas 1:1)

The text says James writes "to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad." His audience is Jewish believers familiar with the law. This context shapes his assumptions: he does not need to explain what "the law" is; his readers know it.

### B. James at the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15:13-21)

The text says that at the Jerusalem Council, James advocated not burdening Gentile converts with the full ceremonial code (Acts 15:19-20). The four requirements he specified (abstain from pollutions of idols, fornication, things strangled, and blood) include moral content (fornication) and do not impose the ceremonial system. This is consistent with his epistle's focus on moral law as the continuing standard.

In Acts 15:21, James adds: "For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day." The text states that Moses is read in synagogues on the Sabbath. James does not here advocate or oppose Sabbath observance; he observes a fact about synagogue practice.

### C. Acts 21:18-24

The text says that James told Paul the believing Jews "are all zealous of the law" (Acts 21:20). James advised Paul to participate in a purification rite to demonstrate that he (Paul) "walkest orderly, and keepest the law" (Acts 21:24). This shows James viewed law-keeping positively and expected it of believers.

### D. Faith and Works (Jas 2:14-26)

The text says James argues faith without works is dead (2:17,26). This follows immediately after the law-of-liberty passage (2:8-13). The "works" James describes include law-keeping -- he has just argued for fulfilling the royal law and keeping the whole law. Faith and law-obedience are not opposed; they work together ("faith wrought with his works," 2:22).

### E. The Judge at the Door (Jas 5:9)

The text says: "Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door." This connects to 4:12 (one lawgiver and judge) and 2:12 (judged by the law of liberty). Judgment is imminent and will be by the standard of the law of liberty.

---

## VIII. Summary of Textual Observations

1. James uses five distinctive law designations found nowhere else in the NT: "perfect law," "law of liberty," "royal law," "one lawgiver," and "doer of the law."

2. James identifies the law's content by quoting OT scripture: Lev 19:18 (love your neighbor) and Exo 20:13-14 (6th and 7th commandments of the Decalogue).

3. James identifies God as the direct speaker of the commandments he cites ("he that said...said also"), which is the distinctive characteristic of the Decalogue (Exo 20:1; Deu 5:4,22).

4. James asserts the law's indivisibility: offending in one point = guilty of all (2:10).

5. James asserts the law's ongoing authority: believers will be "judged by the law of liberty" (2:12); one must be a "doer of the law" (4:11); there is "one lawgiver" (4:12).

6. James presents the law as liberating ("law of liberty"), not burdensome.

7. James never cites ceremonial or civil laws as part of the "royal law" or "law of liberty."

8. James' terminology and argument are consistent with Paul's teaching that love fulfills the law by keeping its specific commandments (Rom 13:8-10; Gal 5:14).

9. James presents a binary: a person is either a "doer of the law" or a "judge" of the law (4:11). Judging the law usurps the authority of the "one lawgiver" (4:12).

10. James' law vocabulary exclusively uses nomos (never entole), treating the law as a unified whole rather than individual commandments.
