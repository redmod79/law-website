# CONCLUSION: law-22 -- James and the Law

## Question

What does James teach about the law? What law does he identify by name and content, what unique vocabulary does he use to describe it, and what does his teaching reveal about the law's authority, character, and ongoing role in the life of believers?

## Summary Answer

James teaches that God's law is "the perfect law of liberty" and "the royal law" -- a law whose content he identifies by explicit quotation as the love command (Lev 19:18) and the sixth and seventh Decalogue commandments (Exo 20:13-14), and whose authority derives from God as the sole lawgiver and judge. He presents this law as operative in the present (believers are commanded to do it, not judge it) and as the standard by which believers will be judged at the last day. Every piece of evidence James provides at the explicit and necessary-implication level supports the law's continuation; no explicit or necessary-implication evidence in James supports its abolition.

## Key Verses

**James 1:25** -- "But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed."

**James 2:8** -- "If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well."

**James 2:9** -- "But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors."

**James 2:10** -- "For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."

**James 2:11** -- "For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law."

**James 2:12** -- "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty."

**James 4:11** -- "He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge."

**James 4:12** -- "There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?"

## Study Summary

This study examined James' three law-passage clusters (Jas 1:22-25, 2:1-13, 4:11-12) as a unified teaching to determine what James says about the law, what law he identifies by name and content, and what his distinctive vocabulary reveals. James employs five law designations found nowhere else in the NT: "the perfect law of liberty" (1:25), "the royal law" (2:8), "the law of liberty" (2:12), "one lawgiver" (4:12), and "doer of the law" (4:11). He identifies the law's content by quoting Lev 19:18 and Decalogue commands (Exo 20:13-14), and asserts the law's ongoing authority, indivisibility, and liberating character.

## Explicit Statements

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Position |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | "But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed." | Jas 1:25 | Continues |
| E2 | "If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well." James identifies this as a quotation from scripture (Lev 19:18). | Jas 2:8 | Continues |
| E3 | "But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors." Partiality is identified as sin, and the law convicts the offender as a transgressor (parabates). | Jas 2:9 | Continues |
| E4 | "For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all." The law is presented as an indivisible whole. | Jas 2:10 | Neutral |
| E5 | "For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law." James cites the 7th commandment (Exo 20:14) and the 6th commandment (Exo 20:13) as content of the law, and identifies God as the direct speaker of both commands ("he that said...said also"). | Jas 2:11 | Continues |
| E6 | "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty." The law of liberty is the standard by which believers will be judged. The imperative verbs ("speak...do") command ongoing conformity to this law. | Jas 2:12 | Continues |
| E7 | "He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge." Speaking evil of a brother constitutes speaking evil of the law. A person is either a doer of the law or a judge of the law. | Jas 4:11 | Continues |
| E8 | "There is one lawgiver (nomothetes -- hapax legomenon), who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?" God is identified as the sole lawgiver and judge. | Jas 4:12 | Continues |
| E9 | James uses parakupto (G3879, "to stoop down and look intently into") for examining the law (Jas 1:25). The same verb is used for looking into the empty tomb (Luk 24:12; Jhn 20:5,11) and for angels desiring to look into salvation (1 Pet 1:12). | Jas 1:25; Luk 24:12; Jhn 20:5,11; 1 Pet 1:12 | Neutral |
| E10 | James uses teleios (G5046, "perfect, complete") for the law (1:25) and also for patience's work (1:4), God's gifts (1:17), and a mature person (3:2). For James, teleios means "complete, lacking nothing." | Jas 1:4,17,25; 3:2 | Neutral |
| E11 | James uses nomos 10 times in 7 verses (1:25; 2:8,9,10,11,12; 4:11[4x]) and never uses entole ("commandment"). He treats the law as a unified whole, not as individual commandments. | Jas 1:25; 2:8-12; 4:11 | Neutral |
| E12 | James writes "to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad" (Jas 1:1). His audience is Jewish believers. | Jas 1:1 | Neutral |
| E13 | The OT text says: "The law of the LORD is perfect (H8549 tamim), converting the soul" (Psa 19:7). James calls it "the perfect law" (nomon teleion, Jas 1:25). Both describe the law with vocabulary meaning "complete, whole, without deficiency." | Psa 19:7; Jas 1:25 | Neutral |
| E14 | The OT text says: "And I will walk at liberty (H7342 barchavah): for I seek thy precepts" (Psa 119:45). The Psalmist experiences liberty through seeking God's precepts. James calls it "the law of liberty." | Psa 119:45; Jas 1:25; 2:12 | Neutral |
| E15 | "For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment." Judgment by the law of liberty (v. 12) includes mercy as a principle. | Jas 2:13 | Neutral |
| E16 | At the Jerusalem Council, James said: "Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood." James advocated not imposing the full ceremonial code on Gentile converts. | Acts 15:19-20 | Neutral |
| E17 | James told Paul that the believing Jews "are all zealous of the law" (Acts 21:20) and advised Paul to demonstrate "that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law" (Acts 21:24). | Acts 21:20,24 | Neutral |
| E18 | Paul states: "Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." Paul quotes the same Lev 19:18 command that James calls "the royal law" and lists the same Decalogue commands James cites (plus others) as the content love fulfills. | Rom 13:8-9 | Continues |
| E19 | "Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door." The coming judge connects to 4:12 (one lawgiver and judge) and 2:12 (judged by the law of liberty). | Jas 5:9 | Neutral |

### Tree 3 Verification of E-Item Positional Classifications

**E1 (Continues) -- Jas 1:25:**
- V1: "the perfect law of liberty...continueth therein...doer of the work...blessed" = law-continuation vocabulary (keep, do, blessed for keeping). YES.
- Gate 1: The "perfect law of liberty" is identified in the same epistle by James with Decalogue content (2:11). PASS.
- Gate 2: Grammar is straightforward -- present/future indicative with aorist participles conditioning the blessing. PASS.
- Gate 3: Didactic epistle. PASS.
- Gate 4: Consistent with E029 (master), E460 (master), and all other law-continuation E-items. PASS.
- **Classification stands: Continues.**

**E2 (Continues) -- Jas 2:8:**
- V1: "fulfil the royal law according to the scripture" -- law-continuation vocabulary (fulfil, do well). YES.
- Gate 1: The royal law is identified "according to the scripture" as Lev 19:18 -- love your neighbor. The content is specified. PASS.
- Gate 2: teleite (present active indicative, "you fulfil") -- ongoing action. Grammar supports continuation. PASS.
- Gate 3: Didactic epistle. PASS.
- Gate 4: Consistent with E028 (master, Rom 13:8-10 -- Paul cites same command with same Decalogue content). PASS.
- **Classification stands: Continues.**

**E3 (Continues) -- Jas 2:9:**
- V1: "convinced of the law as transgressors" -- the law convicts sin, which presupposes the law's authority. Law-continuation vocabulary (transgressor = one who violates an operative law). YES.
- Gate 1: "The law" in v. 9 refers to the same law discussed in vv. 8-12, identified by Decalogue content in v. 11. PASS.
- Gate 2: parabatai (transgressors) is used the same way by Paul (Rom 2:25,27) for violating an operative law. PASS.
- Gate 3: Didactic epistle. PASS.
- Gate 4: Consistent with E010 (Rom 7:12 -- law is holy, just, good), E037 (Rom 2:14-15 -- law written on hearts). PASS.
- **Classification stands: Continues.**

**E4 (Neutral) -- Jas 2:10:**
- V1: "keep the whole law" -- the word "keep" is continuation vocabulary. But the verse's primary point is indivisibility ("offend in one point, guilty of all"), which BOTH sides acknowledge about whatever body of law they identify. The Continues position uses it to show the moral law is a unified whole that continues. The Abolished position uses it to show the law is one undivided body, so if any part is abolished, all is. Both can accept the textual observation.
- **Classification: Neutral.** The indivisibility statement is a textual fact both sides accept; the positional inference from it depends on which law is meant (see I-B resolution below).

**E5 (Continues) -- Jas 2:11:**
- V1: James cites two Decalogue commands and identifies God as their speaker. The Decalogue commands are operative (violation makes one a "transgressor of the law"). Law-continuation vocabulary applied to Decalogue content. YES.
- Gate 1: The referent is identified -- the 7th and 6th commandments of the Decalogue. PASS.
- Gate 2: ho eipon...eipen kai -- "the one having said...said also" -- plain grammar identifying God as speaker. gegonas parabates nomou -- "you have become a transgressor of the law" -- perfect tense, present state. PASS.
- Gate 3: Didactic epistle. PASS.
- Gate 4: Consistent with E018 (master, Rom 13:8-9 -- Paul cites same Decalogue commands as operative). PASS.
- **Classification stands: Continues.**

**E6 (Continues) -- Jas 2:12:**
- V1: "judged by the law of liberty" -- the law of liberty is a future judgment standard. mellontes krinesthai ("being about to be judged") presupposes the law's continuing operation. Believers are commanded to speak and act in conformity with it (imperative mood). YES.
- Gate 1: "Law of liberty" is the same law identified in 1:25 and 2:8-11 (Decalogue + love command). PASS.
- Gate 2: Imperative + future judgment = ongoing obligation. PASS.
- Gate 3: Didactic epistle. PASS.
- Gate 4: Consistent with E029 (master), E460 (master). PASS.
- **Classification stands: Continues.**

**E7 (Continues) -- Jas 4:11:**
- V1: "doer of the law" = law-continuation vocabulary. The prohibition against "judging the law" presupposes the law's authority. YES.
- Gate 1: "The law" (nomos, 4x in this verse) refers to the same law James has discussed throughout -- the one containing the love command and Decalogue. PASS.
- Gate 2: poietes nomou vs. krites -- mutually exclusive binary, present tense. PASS.
- Gate 3: Didactic epistle. PASS.
- Gate 4: Consistent with all prior law-continuation E-items. PASS.
- **Classification stands: Continues.**

**E8 (Continues) -- Jas 4:12:**
- V1: "one lawgiver" (nomothetes, hapax) asserts God's exclusive legislative authority. This is consistent with the Continues position: God gave the moral law, and no human has authority to set it aside. YES.
- Gate 1: The lawgiver is identified as the one "able to save and to destroy" = God. The law in question is the same law discussed throughout James. PASS.
- Gate 2: heis estin nomothetes kai krites -- straightforward copulative. PASS.
- Gate 3: Didactic epistle. PASS.
- Gate 4: Consistent with Isa 33:22 ("the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver"). PASS.
- **Classification stands: Continues.**

## Necessary Implications

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable | Position |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | James identifies the content of "the royal law" and "the law of liberty" as including the love command (Lev 19:18) and the 6th and 7th Decalogue commandments (Exo 20:13-14). The law James calls "perfect," "royal," and "of liberty" contains identifiable Decalogue content. | E2 (Jas 2:8 quotes Lev 19:18), E5 (Jas 2:11 quotes Exo 20:13-14), E6 (Jas 2:12 labels this the "law of liberty") | James explicitly identifies the content by quotation. No reader can deny that James cites these specific commands as part of the law he discusses. | Continues |
| N2 | James identifies God as the direct speaker of the Decalogue commands he cites: "he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill" (2:11). The Decalogue's distinctive characteristic -- that God spoke it directly (Exo 20:1; Deu 5:4,22) -- is the basis of James' argument for the law's indivisibility. | E5 (Jas 2:11 -- "he that said...said also") | The text identifies "he" as the speaker of both commands. Both sides agree God is the referent of "he that said." | Neutral |
| N3 | James asserts the law's ongoing judicial function: believers "shall be judged by the law of liberty" (2:12). The law of liberty is presented as a future standard of judgment, not a past institution. | E6 (Jas 2:12 -- mellontes krinesthai, "being about to be judged"), E19 (Jas 5:9 -- "the judge standeth before the door") | The future tense (mellontes) and present imperative (laleite, poieite) are textually verifiable. The judgment is future; the law is operative in the present and at judgment. No reader can deny the temporal reference. | Continues |
| N4 | James presents a mutually exclusive binary: a person is either a "doer of the law" (poietes nomou) or a "judge" of the law (krites), never both (Jas 4:11). Being a "doer" means accepting the law's authority and obeying it. Being a "judge" means placing oneself above the law, evaluating it rather than obeying it. | E7 (Jas 4:11 -- "thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge") | The alla ("but") creates a binary opposition. This is a grammatical fact: poietes and krites are placed in contrast by the conjunction. No reader can deny the opposition structure. | Continues |
| N5 | James' prohibition against "judging the law" (4:11) presupposes the law is in force. One cannot meaningfully "judge" (krinei nomon) a law that is not operative. The prohibition is unintelligible if the law has been abolished. | E7 (Jas 4:11), E8 (Jas 4:12) | If the law is abolished, "judging" it is unnecessary -- it no longer applies. James' warning against judging the law makes sense only if the law retains authority that humans might attempt to override. Both sides can verify this logical entailment. | Continues |
| N6 | James uses five law designations found nowhere else in the NT: "perfect law" (nomon teleion), "law of liberty" (nomou eleutherias), "royal law" (nomon basilikon), "one lawgiver" (heis nomothetes), "doer of the law" (poietes nomou). | E1, E2, E6, E7, E8, E11 | The uniqueness is verifiable by searching the NT. No reader can produce another occurrence of these exact phrases outside James. | Neutral |
| N7 | James never cites ceremonial or civil laws as part of the "royal law" or "law of liberty." Every scriptural content he identifies belongs to the moral law: Lev 19:18 (love neighbor), Exo 20:13 (do not kill), Exo 20:14 (do not commit adultery). | E2, E5 | The content James quotes is verifiable. No reader can produce a James citation of a ceremonial or civil law as part of his "royal law" or "law of liberty." | Neutral |
| N8 | James and Paul share vocabulary and cite the same OT passages for the operative moral law: both cite Lev 19:18 (James as "the royal law," Paul in Rom 13:9 and Gal 5:14), both cite Decalogue commands (James: 6th, 7th; Paul: 7th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th), and both use the hearer/doer distinction (James: akroates/poietes; Paul: Rom 2:13). | E2, E5, E18 | The shared vocabulary and citations are verifiable by comparing the texts. | Neutral |

## Inferences

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | James' "law of liberty" is the moral law (Decalogue) as the permanent, binding standard for believers, distinct from ceremonial/civil laws that ceased. | I-A | E1 (Jas 1:25: "the perfect law of liberty...doer of the work...blessed"), E2 (Jas 2:8: "the royal law" = Lev 19:18), E5 (Jas 2:11: Decalogue commands cited as the law's content), E6 (Jas 2:12: "judged by the law of liberty"), E7 (Jas 4:11: "doer of the law"), E8 (Jas 4:12: "one lawgiver"). N1 (law of liberty contains identifiable Decalogue content). N7 (James never cites ceremonial/civil laws as part of this law). | Systematizes multiple E/N items into a doctrinal conclusion about the identity of the "law of liberty." All components are found in E/N tables. The inference step is combining them into the claim that the law of liberty = the moral law as distinct from ceremonial/civil. James does not explicitly say "the law of liberty is the Decalogue as distinct from ceremonial law." | 5 |
| I2 | James' "whole law" (2:10) proves all law is one indivisible body; therefore if any part is abolished (e.g., ceremonial law), the entire law including the Decalogue is abolished. | I-B | FOR: E4 (Jas 2:10: "keep the whole law...offend in one point...guilty of all"). AGAINST: E5 (Jas 2:11: James illustrates only with Decalogue commands, never ceremonial), N1 (the content James identifies is Decalogue), N7 (James never cites ceremonial content as part of this law), E16 (Acts 15:19-20: James himself did not impose ceremonial law on Gentile converts). | The claim requires reading "the whole law" as the entire Torah including all ceremonial/civil regulations, then deducing that abolition of any part abolishes all. But James himself at the Jerusalem Council distinguished between moral requirements (fornication) and ceremonial ones he did not impose (Acts 15:19-20). The claim requires importing an "all law is one" framework that James' own practice contradicts. | 1, 2, 5 |
| I3 | James' "law of liberty" is a new "law of Christ" that replaces the OT law. The Decalogue citations are merely illustrative of the new love-standard, not evidence that the Decalogue itself continues. | I-D | E2 (Jas 2:8: James says "according to the scripture" -- locating the law in the OT, not in a new revelation), E5 (Jas 2:11: James identifies God as the speaker of Decalogue commands, not Jesus introducing new commands), E7 (Jas 4:11: the law must be "done" not "judged" -- treating it as pre-existing authority). N1 (the law's content is identified by OT quotation). | This claim requires overriding James' explicit phrase "according to the scripture" (kata ten graphen), which locates the law's source in the OT. It also requires denying the significance of James' identification of God as the Decalogue's speaker (2:11). James never uses kainos ("new") for the law. The claim adds a concept ("replacement") that the text does not contain and contradicts the text's own identification of its OT source. | 1, 3 |
| I4 | James' "perfect law of liberty" corresponds to Psalm 19:7 ("the law of the LORD is perfect") and Psalm 119:45 ("I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts"), establishing a direct OT-to-NT continuity for the moral law. | I-A | E1 (Jas 1:25: nomon teleion, "the perfect law"), E13 (Psa 19:7: "the law of the LORD is perfect [tamim]"), E14 (Psa 119:45: "I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts"). | All components are found in E/N tables. The inference step is drawing the connection between James' "perfect law of liberty" and the Psalmist's "perfect law" + "liberty through precepts." The text does not explicitly say "James is quoting Psalm 19:7" or "James echoes Psalm 119:45." The connection must be inferred from shared vocabulary and concepts. However, the vocabulary overlap ("perfect" + "law," "liberty" + "precepts") is substantial and the concepts are identical. | 4b, 5 |
| I5 | James' prohibition against "judging the law" (4:11) applies to any attempt to declare the moral law abolished. Those who say the Decalogue is no longer binding are "judging the law" rather than being "doers of the law." | I-A | E7 (Jas 4:11: judging the law vs. doing the law), E8 (Jas 4:12: one lawgiver), N4 (doer/judge binary is mutually exclusive), N5 (prohibiting "judging" presupposes the law is operative). | Systematizes James' doer/judge binary into a specific application about those who declare the law abolished. All components are from E/N tables. The inference step is the specific application: James does not explicitly identify "declaring the law abolished" as the kind of "judging" he prohibits. His context is about speaking evil of a brother. | 5 |
| I6 | James' "royal law" (basilikos, "pertaining to a king") designates the moral law as the law of the King (God), the supreme law, or the law governing God's kingdom. This connects to "heirs of the kingdom" (Jas 2:5). | I-A | E2 (Jas 2:8: "the royal law"), E5 (Jas 2:11: God identified as speaker), E8 (Jas 4:12: God as sole lawgiver). The word basilikos means "pertaining to a king" (from basileus). In 2:5, James mentions "heirs of the kingdom." | All vocabulary is from the text. The inference step is connecting basilikos ("royal/kingly") with the kingdom reference in 2:5 and the identification of God as lawgiver in 4:12 to form the claim that the law is "royal" because it belongs to the King. James does not explicitly explain why he uses basilikos. | 5 |
| I7 | James' law theology is in fundamental conflict with Paul's law theology. James says "doer of the law" while Paul says "not under the law" and "by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified." | I-D | E7 (Jas 4:11: "doer of the law"), E18 (Rom 13:8-9: Paul cites same commands as operative). N8 (James and Paul share vocabulary and cite same OT passages). Paul also says "the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (Rom 7:12) and "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law" (Rom 3:31). | This claim requires overriding N8 (shared vocabulary and citations) and ignoring Paul's positive statements about the law (Rom 3:31; 7:12,14; 13:8-10). Paul's "not under the law" (Rom 6:14) addresses being under the law's condemnation/penalty, not release from moral obligation. The claim selects some Paul texts while ignoring others, and denies the observable shared vocabulary between James and Paul. | 1, 3 |

## I-B Resolutions

### I-B Resolution: I2 -- "Whole law" proves all law is one indivisible body; abolishing any part abolishes all

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR: E4 (Jas 2:10: "keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, guilty of all" -- the law is a whole)
- AGAINST: E5 (Jas 2:11: James illustrates only with Decalogue commands), N1 (James' identified content is Decalogue + love command), N7 (James never cites ceremonial content), E16 (Acts 15:19-20: James at the Jerusalem Council did not impose ceremonial law on Gentile converts)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E4 | Plain | James directly states the indivisibility principle |
| E5 | Plain | James directly quotes two Decalogue commands as his illustration |
| N1 | Plain | Observable content identification from E2 and E5 |
| N7 | Plain | Observable absence of ceremonial citations -- no reader can produce one |
| E16 | Plain | James' own words at the Jerusalem Council are directly quoted in Acts |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
The FOR side has one Plain statement (E4) about indivisibility. The AGAINST side has multiple Plain statements: E5 and N1 identify the content as Decalogue, N7 shows no ceremonial content, and E16 shows James himself distinguished moral from ceremonial requirements. The weight of Plain evidence favors the AGAINST side.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
E5 and N1 determine the referent of "the whole law" in E4: James himself defines the scope of his "whole law" by his illustrations, which are exclusively Decalogue commands. When the same author in the same passage illustrates "the whole law" with specific Decalogue commands and never mentions ceremonial laws, the clear passage (E5) governs the reading of the potentially ambiguous phrase "the whole law" (E4). Furthermore, E16 (James at the Jerusalem Council) shows the same author distinguishing between moral requirements imposed on Gentiles and ceremonial requirements not imposed -- demonstrating that James himself did not treat all law as one indivisible body in practice.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
Plain statements from the same author identify the "whole law's" content as Decalogue/moral commands. No ceremonial content appears. The same author's practice (Acts 15) confirms a moral/ceremonial distinction. The claim that "whole law" means all Torah including ceremonial, and that abolishing any part abolishes all, requires importing a framework that James' own text and practice do not support.

## Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-statement directly quotes or closely paraphrases James' text.
- E1-E8 are verse quotations with minimal paraphrase.
- E9-E11 are grammatical/vocabulary observations from the text.
- E12-E19 are contextual and cross-reference observations directly from the text.
- No E-item states what a position infers; all state what the text says.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- All positional E-items (E1-E3, E5-E8) verified via Tree 3 above.
- All four gates passed for each.
- E4 classified Neutral because the indivisibility principle is acknowledged by both sides.
- E9-E17, E19 classified Neutral because they are textual/vocabulary observations both sides accept.
- E18 classified Continues because Paul explicitly lists Decalogue commands as operative.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- N1: Follows from E2 + E5 + E6 -- the content identification is verifiable by quotation. Both sides must acknowledge what James quotes.
- N2: Follows from E5 -- "he that said" identifies God. Neutral because both sides agree God spoke the Decalogue.
- N3: Follows from E6 + E19 -- future judgment by the law is stated in the text. Continues because the law's ongoing judicial function is law-continuation language.
- N4: Follows from E7 -- the alla opposition is grammatical fact. Continues because the doer/judge binary presupposes the law's authority.
- N5: Follows from E7 + E8 -- logical entailment. Continues because the prohibition presupposes operative law.
- N6: Observable vocabulary fact. Neutral.
- N7: Observable content fact. Neutral.
- N8: Observable shared vocabulary. Neutral.
- All N-items pass the three N-tier tests (universal agreement, no interpretation required, zero added concepts).

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
- I1: All components in E/N tables. Text-derived. Systematizes -> I-A. Correct.
- I2: E/N items on both sides. Text-derived but competing. -> I-B. Correct.
- I3: Requires adding "replacement" concept not in text. Overrides E2 ("according to the scripture"). -> I-D. Correct.
- I4: Components in E/N tables. Text-derived. -> I-A. Correct.
- I5: Components in E/N tables. Text-derived. -> I-A. Correct.
- I6: Components in E/N tables. Text-derived. -> I-A. Correct.
- I7: Requires overriding N8. External framework (James-Paul conflict thesis). -> I-D. Correct.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
- I1: No E/N statement reinterpreted. Aligns. I-A correct.
- I2: Requires "whole law" (E4) to mean entire Torah including ceremonial, against E5's Decalogue content. Conflicts. I-B correct.
- I3: Requires "according to the scripture" (E2) to mean something other than OT source identification. Overrides. I-D correct.
- I4: No E/N statement reinterpreted. Aligns. I-A correct.
- I5: No E/N statement reinterpreted. Aligns. I-A correct.
- I6: No E/N statement reinterpreted. Aligns. I-A correct.
- I7: Requires overriding N8 (shared vocabulary). Overrides. I-D correct.

**Step E: Consistency checks.**
- I1 (I-A): Requires only #5 (systematizing). Correct.
- I2 (I-B): E/N items on both sides (E4 vs. E5/N1/N7/E16). Correct.
- I3 (I-D): Overrides E2 ("according to the scripture"). Correct.
- I4 (I-A): Requires #4b + #5 (cross-reference without explicit textual link + systematizing). Correct.
- I5 (I-A): Requires only #5. Correct.
- I6 (I-A): Requires only #5. Correct.
- I7 (I-D): Overrides N8 (shared vocabulary). Correct.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- I4 uses #4b (cross-reference: Psa 19:7 / Psa 119:45 to Jas 1:25). The connection is vocabulary-based ("perfect" + "law," "liberty" + "precepts") but James does not explicitly quote or reference Psalm 19:7 or 119:45. Classified as #4b (inference trigger). Correct.

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies)

1. James calls the law "the perfect law of liberty" (Jas 1:25) -- the law is complete and brings freedom.
2. James calls the law "the royal law according to the scripture" (Jas 2:8) and identifies it by quoting Lev 19:18.
3. James identifies the law's content as including the 6th and 7th Decalogue commands (Jas 2:11) and the love command (Jas 2:8).
4. James identifies God as the direct speaker of the Decalogue commands he cites (Jas 2:11).
5. James asserts the law's indivisibility: offending in one point makes one guilty of all (Jas 2:10).
6. James states believers will be judged by the law of liberty (Jas 2:12).
7. James presents a binary: a person is either a doer of the law or a judge of the law (Jas 4:11).
8. James identifies God as the one lawgiver and judge (Jas 4:12), using the NT hapax nomothetes.
9. James' prohibition against judging the law presupposes the law is operative (Jas 4:11).
10. James never cites ceremonial or civil laws as part of his "royal law" or "law of liberty."
11. James and Paul share vocabulary (parabates, akroates, poietes) and cite the same OT passages (Lev 19:18; Decalogue commands) for the operative moral law.
12. James uses the law-as-mirror metaphor: the law reveals what a person truly is (Jas 1:23-25).
13. James at the Jerusalem Council did not impose the full ceremonial code on Gentile converts (Acts 15:19-20).

## What CANNOT Be Said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture)

1. It cannot be said that James' "law of liberty" is a new law that replaces the OT law. James locates it "according to the scripture" (kata ten graphen) in the OT.
2. It cannot be said that James' "whole law" (2:10) includes ceremonial laws in its scope. James' own illustrations are exclusively from the Decalogue.
3. It cannot be said that James' law theology contradicts Paul's. Both cite the same commands, use the same vocabulary, and affirm the moral law's authority.
4. It cannot be said that James' law of liberty has been abolished. James describes it as a future judgment standard (2:12), commands conformity to it in the present (2:12, imperative), and prohibits judging it (4:11).
5. It cannot be said that "judging the law" (4:11) refers to any specific modern theological position. James' context is speaking evil of a brother.
6. It cannot be said that James explicitly addresses the Sabbath. No Sabbath reference appears in James' epistle. The Sabbath question is not resolved by James' text alone.
7. It cannot be said that James' "royal law" refers only to the love command to the exclusion of the Decalogue commands he also cites. James treats the love command and the Decalogue commands as part of the same law.
8. It cannot be said that James viewed all law as one indivisible unit in practice, given his distinction between moral requirements imposed on Gentiles and ceremonial requirements not imposed (Acts 15:19-20).
