## [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- nomos (law)

**Original:** nomos
**Transliteration:** nómos
**Pronunciation:** nom
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**Definition:** From a primary nemo (to parcel out, especially food or grazing); a precept or statute, especially the Decalogue or Pentateuch -- law.
**BLB Count:** 197 NT occurrences

### Translations in KJV (169 counted by Strong's DB)
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| law | 95 | 56.2% |
| the law | 49 | 29.0% |
| of the law | 14 | 8.3% |
| a law | 2 | 1.2% |
| to the law | 2 | 1.2% |
| laws | 2 | 1.2% |
| Other | 5 | 3.0% |

### Usage in James
James uses nomos 10 times across 7 verses:
1. **Jas 1:25** -- "the perfect law (nomon teleion) of liberty" -- accusative, anarthrous initially but with delayed article (ton tes eleutherias)
2. **Jas 2:8** -- "the royal law (nomon...basilikon)" -- accusative, anarthrous
3. **Jas 2:9** -- "convinced of the law (tou nomou) as transgressors" -- genitive, articular
4. **Jas 2:10** -- "the whole law (holon ton nomon)" -- accusative, articular
5. **Jas 2:11** -- "a transgressor of the law (nomou)" -- genitive, anarthrous
6. **Jas 2:12** -- "the law (nomou) of liberty" -- genitive, anarthrous
7. **Jas 4:11** (4x) -- "speaketh evil of the law (nomou)...judgeth the law (nomon)...judge the law (nomon)...doer of the law (nomou)" -- genitive and accusative, articular/anarthrous mix

### Articular/Anarthrous Pattern in James
- **With article (definite):** Jas 2:9 (tou nomou), 2:10 (ton nomon), 4:11 (some uses)
- **Without article but definite by context:** Jas 1:25, 2:8, 2:11, 2:12
- **With qualifying adjectives:** 1:25 (teleion -- "perfect"), 2:8 (basilikon -- "royal")
- **With qualifying genitives:** 1:25, 2:12 (eleutherias -- "of liberty")

James uses distinctive qualifiers for nomos found nowhere else in the NT: "perfect" (teleios), "royal" (basilikos), and "of liberty" (tes eleutherias / eleutherias). These qualifiers distinguish James' law-designations from Paul's ("law of works," "law of faith," "law of the Spirit of life," "law of Christ").

## [G5046](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5046/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- teleios (perfect)

**Original:** teleios
**Transliteration:** téleios
**Pronunciation:** tel-i-os
**Part of Speech:** adjective (adj)
**Definition:** From telos (end, goal); complete in various applications of labor, growth, mental and moral character -- perfect, complete, mature.
**BLB Count:** 19 NT occurrences

### Translations in KJV (12 counted)
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| perfect | 6 | 50.0% |
| are perfect | 1 | 8.3% |
| is perfect | 1 | 8.3% |
| men | 1 | 8.3% |
| a perfect | 1 | 8.3% |
| of full age | 1 | 8.3% |
| more perfect | 1 | 8.3% |

### Usage in James
James uses teleios 4 times -- more than any other NT author in a single book:
1. **Jas 1:4** -- "let patience have her perfect (teleion) work, that ye may be perfect (teleioi) and entire"
2. **Jas 1:17** -- "every perfect (teleion) gift is from above"
3. **Jas 1:25** -- "the perfect (teleion) law of liberty"
4. **Jas 3:2** -- "a perfect (teleios) man"

### Key Parallel: Psalm 19:7
Psa 19:7 says "The law of the LORD is **perfect** (H8549 tamim/temimah)." The LXX translates this as "the law of the Lord is **amomatos**" (blameless/unblemished). While the LXX does not use teleios here, James' use of teleios for the law serves the same theological function -- declaring the law "complete, whole, without deficiency." The concept is identical even if the specific Greek word differs.

### Other NT uses of teleios for comparison
- Mat 5:48 -- "Be ye therefore perfect (teleioi), even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect (teleios)" -- God's character as the standard
- Rom 12:2 -- "that perfect (teleion) will of God"
- 1 Cor 13:10 -- "when that which is perfect (teleion) is come"
- Heb 9:11 -- "a greater and more perfect (teleioteras) tabernacle"

## [G1657](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1657/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- eleutheria (liberty, freedom)

**Original:** eleutheria
**Transliteration:** eleuthería
**Pronunciation:** el-yoo-ther-ee-ah
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**Definition:** From eleutheros (free); freedom, legitimate or licentious, chiefly moral or ceremonial -- liberty.
**BLB Count:** 11 NT occurrences

### Translations in KJV
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| liberty | 9 | 100% |

### All NT Occurrences
1. **Rom 8:21** -- "the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious **liberty** of the children of God"
2. **1 Cor 10:29** -- "why is my **liberty** judged of another man's conscience?"
3. **2 Cor 3:17** -- "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is **liberty**"
4. **Gal 2:4** -- "to spy out our **liberty** which we have in Christ Jesus"
5. **Gal 5:1** -- "Stand fast therefore in the **liberty** wherewith Christ hath made us free"
6. **Gal 5:13** -- "ye have been called unto **liberty**; only use not **liberty** for an occasion to the flesh"
7. **Jas 1:25** -- "the perfect law of **liberty**"
8. **Jas 2:12** -- "judged by the law of **liberty**"
9. **1 Pet 2:16** -- "not using your **liberty** for a cloke of maliciousness"
10. **2 Pet 2:19** -- "they promise them **liberty**, they themselves are the servants of corruption"

### Semantic Range
The word always means "freedom/liberty" but its APPLICATION varies:
- **Freedom from corruption/bondage:** Rom 8:21
- **Freedom of conscience:** 1 Cor 10:29
- **Spiritual freedom through the Spirit:** 2 Cor 3:17
- **Freedom in Christ (from legalism/bondage):** Gal 2:4; 5:1; 5:13
- **The law's character as liberating:** Jas 1:25; 2:12
- **Moral liberty (not license):** 1 Pet 2:16
- **False liberty (license to sin):** 2 Pet 2:19

### James' Distinctive Usage
James alone in the NT pairs eleutheria with nomos. For Paul, eleutheria is freedom FROM the law (or from the law's condemning function). For James, eleutheria is a quality OF the law itself -- the law IS the instrument of liberty. This is not necessarily a contradiction: Paul speaks of freedom from the law's condemning/cursing function (Gal 3:10,13), while James speaks of the law's liberating function when obeyed (cf. Psa 119:45).

## [G937](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g937/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- basilikos (royal, kingly)

**Original:** basilikos
**Transliteration:** basilikós
**Pronunciation:** bas-il-ee-kos
**Part of Speech:** adjective (adj)
**Definition:** From basileus (king); regal, belonging to or befitting a king -- king's, royal, nobleman.
**BLB Count:** 5 NT occurrences

### All NT Occurrences
1. **Jhn 4:46** -- "there was a certain **nobleman** (basilikos), whose son was sick"
2. **Jhn 4:49** -- "The **nobleman** (basilikos) saith unto him"
3. **Acts 12:20** -- "because their country was nourished by the **king's** (basilikes) country"
4. **Acts 12:21** -- "arrayed in **royal** (basiliken) apparel"
5. **Jas 2:8** -- "the **royal** (basilikon) law"

### Significance
Basilikos means "pertaining to a king." When applied to law, it can mean:
- **The law of the King (God)** -- the law that belongs to the King
- **The kingly/supreme law** -- the law that rules over all others
- **The law of the kingdom** -- the law that governs God's kingdom

The word's root (basileus = king) connects to James' mention of "heirs of the kingdom" (Jas 2:5). The "royal law" governs the kingdom that God has promised.

## [G2635](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2635/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- katalaleo (to speak evil of)

**Original:** katalaleo
**Transliteration:** katalaléō
**Pronunciation:** kat-al-al-eh-o
**Part of Speech:** verb (v)
**Definition:** From katallalos (a defamer); to be a traducer, to slander -- speak against, speak evil of.
**BLB Count:** 5 NT occurrences

### All NT Occurrences
1. **Jas 4:11** (used 3x in this verse) -- "Speak not evil (katalaleite)...speaketh evil (katalalon) of his brother...speaketh evil (katalaleite) of the law"
2. **1 Pet 2:12** -- "they speak against you (katalalousin) as evildoers"
3. **1 Pet 3:16** -- "they that falsely accuse (katalalountes)"

### Significance
James' unique argument: speaking evil of a brother (katalaleo) IS speaking evil of the law. The verb appears 3 of 5 NT times in Jas 4:11 alone. James creates a chain: speaking evil of brother = speaking evil of law = judging the law = not being a doer of the law but a judge.

---

## [G2923](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2923/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- krites (judge)

**Original:** krites
**Transliteration:** kritḗs
**Pronunciation:** kree-tace
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**Definition:** From krino (to judge); a judge -- judge.
**BLB Count:** 17 NT occurrences

### Usage in James
1. **Jas 2:4** -- "are become **judges** (kritai) of evil thoughts"
2. **Jas 4:11** -- "thou art not a doer of the law, but a **judge** (krites)"
3. **Jas 4:12** -- "one lawgiver and **judge** (krites), who is able to save and to destroy"
4. **Jas 5:9** -- "behold, the **judge** (krites) standeth before the door"

### Significance
James uses krites 4 times. In 4:11-12, he contrasts the human role (doer of the law) with God's role (judge and lawgiver). In 4:12, krites is paired with the hapax nomothetes -- God is BOTH lawgiver AND judge. In 5:9, "the judge" is Christ, who stands "before the door" -- connecting judgment to eschatology.

---

## [G3550](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3550/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- nomothetes (lawgiver)

**Original:** nomothetes
**Transliteration:** nomothetēs
**Pronunciation:** nom-oth-et'-ace
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**Definition:** From nomos (law) + tithemi (to place/establish); a legislator -- lawgiver.
**BLB Count:** 1 NT occurrence (HAPAX LEGOMENON)

### The Single NT Occurrence
- **Jas 4:12** -- "There is one **lawgiver** (nomothetes), who is able to save and to destroy"

### Significance
This is the ONLY occurrence of nomothetes in the entire NT. James coins (or uniquely employs) this term to assert God's exclusive legislative authority. The compound nomos + tithemi means "one who establishes/places the law." Combined with "one" (heis), James asserts: there is ONE person who has authority to establish the law. This person is also identified as "judge" (krites) and as the one "able to save and to destroy." This unique legislative authority means humans cannot "judge the law" (4:11) -- they can only be "doers" of it.

Classical Greek uses: Plato and Demosthenes used nomothetes for human legislators, but James applies it exclusively to God.

## [G3848](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3848/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- parabates (transgressor)

**Original:** parabates
**Transliteration:** parabátēs
**Pronunciation:** par-ab-at-ace
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**Definition:** From parabaino (to go aside); a violator -- breaker, transgressor.
**BLB Count:** 5 NT occurrences

### All NT Occurrences
1. **Rom 2:25** -- "if thou be a **breaker** (parabates) of the law"
2. **Rom 2:27** -- "who dost **transgress** (parabaten) the law"
3. **Gal 2:18** -- "I make myself a **transgressor** (parabaten)"
4. **Jas 2:9** -- "convinced of the law as **transgressors** (parabatai)"
5. **Jas 2:11** -- "thou art become a **transgressor** (parabates) of the law"

### Significance
James uses parabates 2 of 5 NT times. In both uses, the law identifies and convicts the transgressor. The law is a standard -- violating ANY part makes one a parabates. Paul uses the same word in the same way (Rom 2:25,27). The shared vocabulary indicates James and Paul share the same concept of law-transgression.

## [G3879](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3879/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- parakupto (to look intently into)

**Original:** parakupto
**Transliteration:** parakýptō
**Pronunciation:** par-ak-oop-to
**Part of Speech:** verb (v)
**Definition:** From para (beside) + kupto (to bend); to bend beside, to lean over so as to peer within -- look into, stoop down.
**BLB Count:** 5 NT occurrences

### All NT Occurrences
1. **Luk 24:12** -- Peter "stooping down (parakupsas), he beheld" the empty tomb
2. **Jhn 20:5** -- the other disciple "stooping down (parakupsas), and looking in, saw the linen"
3. **Jhn 20:11** -- Mary "stooped down (parekupsen), and looked into the sepulchre"
4. **Jas 1:25** -- "whoso looketh into (parakupsas) the perfect law of liberty"
5. **1 Pet 1:12** -- "which things the angels desire to look into (parakupsai)"

### Significance
This is a striking verb choice. James uses the SAME word used for looking intently into the empty tomb (Luk 24:12; Jhn 20:5,11) and the same word for angels desiring to look into the mysteries of salvation (1 Pet 1:12). It conveys not a casual glance but an INTENSE, INTENT examination -- bending over to peer carefully. James says one must "look intently into" the law in this same way. The law-as-mirror metaphor requires this kind of careful, penetrating examination.

---

## [G2072](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2072/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- esoptron (mirror, looking glass)

**Original:** esoptron
**Transliteration:** ésoptron
**Pronunciation:** es-op-tron
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun (n)
**Definition:** From a root meaning to look into; a mirror -- glass, looking glass.
**BLB Count:** 2 NT occurrences

### All NT Occurrences
1. **1 Cor 13:12** -- "For now we see through a **glass** (esoptrou), darkly"
2. **Jas 1:23** -- "beholding his natural face in a **glass** (esoptro)"

### Significance
James uses the law-as-mirror metaphor. The mirror (esoptron) shows one's "natural face" (to prosopon tes geneseos -- literally "the face of origin/birth"). The law reveals what a person truly IS. One who merely looks and walks away "forgets" what they saw. One who "looks intently" (parakupto) and "continues" (parameno) is blessed. The metaphor implies the law has a REVELATORY function -- it shows sin (cf. Rom 7:7 "I had not known sin, but by the law").

---

## [G458](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g458/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- anomia (lawlessness)

**Original:** anomia
**Transliteration:** anomía
**Pronunciation:** an-om-ee-ah
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**Definition:** From anomos (lawless); illegality, violation of law or wickedness -- iniquity, transgression of law, unrighteousness.
**BLB Count:** 15 NT occurrences

### Key Occurrence
- **1 Jhn 3:4** -- "sin is the transgression of the law (anomia)" -- literally "sin IS anomia (lawlessness)"

### Significance for James
While James does not use anomia, the concept is central to his argument. James uses parabates (transgressor, 2:9,11) and katalaleo (speak against the law, 4:11) -- both presuppose that the law defines sin. John's definition (1 Jhn 3:4) provides the theological framework: sin = lawlessness. James shows that partiality (2:9), murder, and adultery (2:11) are all violations of this law.

---

## Hebrew Background Terms

### [H8451](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8451/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- torah (law, instruction)

**Original:** torah / towrah
**Transliteration:** tôwrâh
**Pronunciation:** to-raw
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**Definition:** From yarah (to throw, cast, direct); a precept or statute, especially the Decalogue or Pentateuch -- law.
**BLB Count:** 219 OT occurrences

**Significance:** Torah is the Hebrew behind James' Greek nomos. The LXX consistently translates torah as nomos. Torah means "instruction/direction" -- it is inherently positive, guiding rather than merely prohibiting. This background illuminates why James can call the law "perfect" and "of liberty" -- torah in its Hebrew conception is God's instruction for life.

### [H4687](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4687/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- mitsvah (commandment)

**Original:** mitsvah
**Transliteration:** mitsvâh
**Pronunciation:** mits-vaw
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**Definition:** From tsavah (to command); a command, whether human or divine -- commandment, law, ordinance, precept.
**BLB Count:** 181 OT occurrences

**Significance:** Mitsvah is the specific "commandment" behind the individual Decalogue commands James cites (Exo 20:13-14). The LXX translates mitsvah as entole. Notably, James uses nomos (law) rather than entole (commandment) throughout his epistle -- he always speaks of the LAW as a whole, never of individual commandments in isolation.

### [H1865](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1865/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- deror (liberty, freedom)

**Original:** deror
**Transliteration:** dᵉrôwr
**Pronunciation:** der-ore
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**Definition:** From an unused root meaning to move rapidly; freedom, spontaneity of outflow -- liberty, pure.
**BLB Count:** 8 OT occurrences

### All OT Occurrences
1. Exo 30:23 -- "pure (deror) myrrh" (spontaneous flow)
2. Lev 25:10 -- "proclaim **liberty** (deror) throughout all the land" (jubilee)
3. Isa 61:1 -- "proclaim **liberty** (deror) to the captives"
4. Jer 34:8,15,17 -- "to proclaim **liberty** (deror)" (release of slaves)
5. Eze 46:17 -- "the year of **liberty** (deror)"

**Significance:** Deror is used exclusively for formal, proclaimed liberation -- the jubilee release of slaves and debts. Isaiah 61:1 uses it for Messianic liberation. This OT background for "liberty" connects to James' "law of liberty" (eleutheria) -- the law itself is an instrument of proclaimed freedom, echoing the jubilee tradition.

### [H4941](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4941/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- mishpat (judgment, justice)

**Original:** mishpat
**Transliteration:** mishpâṭ
**Pronunciation:** mish-pawt
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**Definition:** From shaphat (to judge); a verdict, sentence, formal decree, justice, right -- judgment, justice, manner, law, ordinance.
**BLB Count:** 421 OT occurrences

**Significance:** Mishpat connects to James' theme of judgment (krites/krino) throughout the epistle. God's mishpat (justice/judgment) is the standard -- He is the one who judges (Jas 4:12), and believers will be "judged by the law of liberty" (Jas 2:12).

### [H2706](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2706/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- choq (statute, decree)

**Original:** choq
**Transliteration:** chôq
**Pronunciation:** khoke
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**Definition:** From chaqaq (to engrave); an enactment, appointment -- statute, decree, law, ordinance, custom.
**BLB Count:** 127 OT occurrences

**Significance:** Choq is used for God's fixed, permanent statutes. Combined with torah and mitsvah, it forms the vocabulary cluster for God's law in the OT. James' NT presentation of the law as permanent and authoritative (4:12 "one lawgiver") aligns with the OT conception of choq as fixed divine decree.

- parakupsas (aorist participle) -- the action of "looking intently into" precedes and conditions the main verb estai ("shall be")
- parameinas (aorist participle) -- "having continued" -- also precedes the blessing
- nomon teleion ton tes eleutherias -- the article ton is DELAYED, creating emphasis: "law perfect -- THE one of liberty"
- poietes ergou -- "a doer of work" (not just a hearer of forgetfulness)

**Key grammatical notes:**

- nomon basilikon -- anarthrous, but definite by context ("THE royal law")
- kata ten graphen -- "according to THE scripture" -- James identifies the source as Lev 19:18
- The quotation Agapeseis ("you shall love") is future indicative used as imperative, per LXX convention

**Key grammatical notes:**
- holon ton nomon -- "the whole law" -- articular, emphasizing totality
- terese...ptaise -- both aorist subjunctive, conditional hypothetical
- gegonen -- PERFECT tense ("has become and remains") -- the guilt is a PRESENT STATE resulting from the past stumbling
- panton enochos -- "guilty of all" -- the law is indivisible; breaking one = breaking all

**Key grammatical notes:**
- ho eipon ("the one having said") -- the SUBJECT (God) is identified as the speaker of BOTH commands
- eipen kai -- "said also" -- the SAME speaker gave both the 7th and 6th commandments
- gegonas parabates nomou -- "you have become a transgressor of [the] law" -- perfect tense again (present state), and nomou is ANARTHROUS but definite by context (the law already under discussion)
- The argument: ONE God gave BOTH commands, therefore violating EITHER makes one a transgressor of THE WHOLE law

**Key grammatical notes:**
- laleite...poieite -- IMPERATIVE mood, commands: "Speak and do!"
- dia nomou eleutherias -- "through/by the law of liberty" -- the standard BY WHICH judgment occurs
- mellontes krinesthai -- "being about to be judged" -- present participle + passive infinitive -- judgment is FUTURE but CERTAIN
- nomou eleutherias is ANARTHROUS here (no article), but refers to the same "law of liberty" as 1:25

**Key grammatical notes:**
- nomos appears 4x in this single verse -- James hammers the law's authority
- katalaleo appears 3x -- speaking evil is the central action condemned
- The logical chain: speaking evil of brother --> speaking evil of law --> judging the law
- poietes nomou vs krites -- binary: one is either a DOER of the law or a JUDGE of the law. These are mutually exclusive positions.
