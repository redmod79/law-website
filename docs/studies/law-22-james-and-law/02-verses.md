## Primary Verses -- Complete Epistle of James

### James 1 (Full Chapter)

> **1:1** James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
> **1:2** My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
> **1:3** Knowing [this], that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
> **1:4** But let patience have [her] perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
> **1:5** If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
> **1:6** But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
> **1:7** For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
> **1:8** A double minded man [is] unstable in all his ways.
> **1:9** Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
> **1:10** But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
> **1:11** For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
> **1:12** Blessed [is] the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
> **1:13** Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
> **1:14** But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
> **1:15** Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
> **1:16** Do not err, my beloved brethren.
> **1:17** Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
> **1:18** Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
> **1:19** Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
> **1:20** For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
> **1:21** Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
> **1:22** But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
> **1:23** For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
> **1:24** For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
> **1:25** But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth [therein], he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
> **1:26** If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion [is] vain.
> **1:27** Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, [and] to keep himself unspotted from the world.

### James 2 (Full Chapter)

> **2:1** My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons.
> **2:2** For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
> **2:3** And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
> **2:4** Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
> **2:5** Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
> **2:6** But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
> **2:7** Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
> **2:8** If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
> **2:9** But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
> **2:10** For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.
> **2:11** For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
> **2:12** So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
> **2:13** For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
> **2:14** What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
> **2:15** If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
> **2:16** And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be [ye] warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what [doth it] profit?
> **2:17** Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
> **2:18** Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
> **2:19** Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
> **2:20** But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
> **2:21** Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
> **2:22** Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
> **2:23** And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
> **2:24** Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
> **2:25** Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent [them] out another way?
> **2:26** For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

### James 3 (Full Chapter)

> **3:1** My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
> **3:2** For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same [is] a perfect man, [and] able also to bridle the whole body.
> **3:3** Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.
> **3:4** Behold also the ships, which though [they be] so great, and [are] driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.
> **3:5** Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
> **3:6** And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
> **3:7** For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:
> **3:8** But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
> **3:9** Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.
> **3:10** Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
> **3:11** Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet [water] and bitter?
> **3:12** Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so [can] no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
> **3:13** Who [is] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
> **3:14** But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
> **3:15** This wisdom descendeth not from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, devilish.
> **3:16** For where envying and strife [is], there [is] confusion and every evil work.
> **3:17** But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, [and] easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
> **3:18** And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.

### James 4 (Full Chapter)

> **4:1** From whence [come] wars and fightings among you? [come they] not hence, [even] of your lusts that war in your members?
> **4:2** Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.
> **4:3** Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume [it] upon your lusts.
> **4:4** Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
> **4:5** Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
> **4:6** But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
> **4:7** Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
> **4:8** Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse [your] hands, [ye] sinners; and purify [your] hearts, [ye] double minded.
> **4:9** Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and [your] joy to heaviness.
> **4:10** Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
> **4:11** Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of [his] brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
> **4:12** There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?
> **4:13** Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:
> **4:14** Whereas ye know not what [shall be] on the morrow. For what [is] your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
> **4:15** For that ye [ought] to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
> **4:16** But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
> **4:17** Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth [it] not, to him it is sin.

### James 5 (Full Chapter)

> **5:1** Go to now, [ye] rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon [you].
> **5:2** Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.
> **5:3** Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.
> **5:4** Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.
> **5:5** Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.
> **5:6** Ye have condemned [and] killed the just; [and] he doth not resist you.
> **5:7** Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.
> **5:8** Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
> **5:9** Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.
> **5:10** Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.
> **5:11** Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.
> **5:12** But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and [your] nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.
> **5:13** Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
> **5:14** Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
> **5:15** And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
> **5:16** Confess [your] faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
> **5:17** Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.
> **5:18** And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
> **5:19** Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;
> **5:20** Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.

## OT Background Passages

### The Decalogue -- Exodus 20:1-17

> **20:1** And God spake all these words, saying,
> **20:2** I [am] the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
> **20:3** Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
> **20:4** Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness [of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the water under the earth:
> **20:5** Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth [generation] of them that hate me;
> **20:6** And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
> **20:7** Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
> **20:8** Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
> **20:9** Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:
> **20:10** But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of the LORD thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is] within thy gates:
> **20:11** For [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them [is], and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
> **20:12** Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
> **20:13** Thou shalt not kill.
> **20:14** Thou shalt not commit adultery.
> **20:15** Thou shalt not steal.
> **20:16** Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
> **20:17** Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that [is] thy neighbour's.

**James quotes from this passage:** Exo 20:13 ("Thou shalt not kill") and Exo 20:14 ("Thou shalt not commit adultery") in Jas 2:11.

### Leviticus 19:13-18 -- Love Thy Neighbour

> **19:13** Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob [him]: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.
> **19:14** Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I [am] the LORD.
> **19:15** Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: [but] in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.
> **19:16** Thou shalt not go up and down [as] a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I [am] the LORD.
> **19:17** Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.
> **19:18** Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I [am] the LORD.

**James quotes from this passage:** Lev 19:18 ("Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself") in Jas 2:8 as "the royal law according to the scripture." Note also Lev 19:15 ("thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty") -- the exact issue James addresses in Jas 2:1-9 regarding partiality.

### Deuteronomy 5:4,22 -- God Spoke the Decalogue Directly

> **5:4** The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,
> **5:22** These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.

**Significance for James:** In Jas 2:11, James says "he that said (ho eipon), Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill." The "he that said" identifies God as the direct speaker. Deu 5:4,22 confirms that God spoke the Ten Commandments directly -- a unique characteristic of the Decalogue among all OT laws. The rest of the law was given through Moses as intermediary.

### Deuteronomy 1:16-17 -- Impartial Judgment

> **1:16** And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your brethren, and judge righteously between [every] man and his brother, and the stranger [that is] with him.
> **1:17** Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; [but] ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment [is] God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring [it] unto me, and I will hear it.

**Significance for James:** The "judgment is God's" in Deu 1:17 parallels Jas 4:12 ("There is one lawgiver...one judge"). The prohibition against respecting persons parallels Jas 2:1-9.

### Psalm 19:7-9 -- The Perfect Law

> **19:7** The law of the LORD [is] perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD [is] sure, making wise the simple.
> **19:8** The statutes of the LORD [are] right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD [is] pure, enlightening the eyes.
> **19:9** The fear of the LORD [is] clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD [are] true [and] righteous altogether.

**Significance for James:** "The law of the LORD is perfect" (Psa 19:7) uses Hebrew temimah (H8549, "complete, whole, without blemish"). James calls it "the perfect law" (ton teleion nomon, G5046). This is a direct vocabulary parallel: both describe the law as "perfect/complete."

### Psalm 119:45 -- Liberty and Precepts

> **119:45** And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.

**Significance for James:** This is the clearest OT precedent for the concept of "law of liberty." The Psalmist walks at LIBERTY precisely because he seeks God's PRECEPTS. Liberty comes through the law, not apart from it -- the same concept James expresses in "the perfect law of liberty."

### Psalm 119:96-97 -- Broad Commandment

> **119:96** I have seen an end of all perfection: [but] thy commandment [is] exceeding broad.
> **119:97** MEM. O how love I thy law! it [is] my meditation all the day.

### Psalm 119:142 -- Law Is Truth

> **119:142** Thy righteousness [is] an everlasting righteousness, and thy law [is] the truth.

### Psalm 119:165 -- Peace Through Loving the Law

> **119:165** Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.

### Leviticus 25:10 -- Jubilee Liberty

> **25:10** And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout [all] the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.

**Significance for James:** The OT jubilee "liberty" (deror, H1865) is a proclamation of FREEDOM from bondage/debt. This provides background for James' "law of liberty" -- a law that proclaims freedom rather than imposing bondage.

### Isaiah 61:1-2 -- Messianic Liberty

> **61:1** The Spirit of the Lord GOD [is] upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to [them that are] bound;
> **61:2** To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;

**Significance for James:** Isaiah's Messianic prophecy uses deror (H1865) for "liberty to the captives." Jesus read this passage in Luke 4:18-19 and declared it fulfilled. James' "law of liberty" may draw on this Messianic liberty tradition -- the law mediated through Christ's work brings freedom.

## NT Cross-Reference Passages

### Matthew 5:17-19 -- Jesus and the Law's Continuity

> **5:17** Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
> **5:18** For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
> **5:19** Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach [them], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

**Parallel to James:** Mat 5:19 ("break one of these least commandments") parallels Jas 2:10 ("offend in one point, guilty of all"). Both affirm the law's indivisibility.

### Matthew 5:27-28 -- Adultery Command Deepened

> **5:27** Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
> **5:28** But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.

### Matthew 7:1-5 -- Judge Not

> **7:1** Judge not, that ye be not judged.
> **7:2** For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
> **7:3** And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
> **7:4** Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam [is] in thine own eye?
> **7:5** Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.

**Parallel to James:** Mat 7:1-5 parallels Jas 4:11-12. Jesus prohibits hypocritical judging; James prohibits judging the law/judging the brother.

### Matthew 22:36-40 -- The Two Great Commandments

> **22:36** Master, which [is] the great commandment in the law?
> **22:37** Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
> **22:38** This is the first and great commandment.
> **22:39** And the second [is] like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
> **22:40** On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

**Parallel to James:** James quotes the same command (Lev 19:18) as the "royal law" (Jas 2:8) that Jesus identifies as the second great commandment. For Jesus, love is the SUMMARY of the law, not its REPLACEMENT.

### Mark 12:28-34 -- Greatest Commandment

> **12:28** And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
> **12:29** And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:
> **12:30** And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this [is] the first commandment.
> **12:31** And the second [is] like, [namely] this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.
> **12:32** And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:
> **12:33** And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love [his] neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
> **12:34** And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him [any question].

### Luke 4:18-19 -- Jesus Reads Isaiah 61

> **4:18** The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,
> **4:19** To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

### John 8:31-36 -- Truth and Freedom

> **8:31** Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, [then] are ye my disciples indeed;
> **8:32** And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
> **8:33** They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
> **8:34** Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.
> **8:35** And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: [but] the Son abideth ever.
> **8:36** If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.

**Parallel to James:** Jesus' concept of freedom (from sin's bondage) aligns with James' "law of liberty" -- the law itself brings freedom when obeyed through Christ.

### John 13:34 -- New Commandment

> **13:34** A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.

### Acts 15:13-21 -- James at the Jerusalem Council

> **15:13** And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men [and] brethren, hearken unto me:
> **15:14** Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
> **15:15** And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
> **15:16** After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:
> **15:17** That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.
> **15:18** Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.
> **15:19** Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:
> **15:20** But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and [from] fornication, and [from] things strangled, and [from] blood.
> **15:21** For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.

**Significance for James:** This is James speaking at the Jerusalem Council. He advocates NOT burdening Gentile converts with the full Mosaic ceremonial code, while the four requirements he lists touch on moral/dietary matters. This is consistent with his epistle's focus on the moral law (Decalogue) as the continuing standard.

### Acts 21:18-24 -- James and Paul Regarding the Law

> **21:18** And the [day] following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.
> **21:19** And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.
> **21:20** And when they heard [it], they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:
> **21:21** And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise [their] children, neither to walk after the customs.
> **21:22** What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.
> **21:23** Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;
> **21:24** Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave [their] heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but [that] thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.

**Significance for James:** James tells Paul that the believing Jews "are all zealous of the law." James himself apparently walked orderly and kept the law. This is consistent with his epistle's high view of the law.

### Romans 2:12-13 -- Doers of the Law

> **2:12** For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
> **2:13** (For not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.

**Parallel to James:** Rom 2:13 ("doers of the law") directly parallels Jas 1:22-25 ("be ye doers of the word, not hearers only") and Jas 4:11 ("not a doer of the law, but a judge"). The hearer/doer distinction is shared vocabulary.

### Romans 7:7,12 -- The Law Is Holy

> **7:7** What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
> **7:12** Wherefore the law [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.

### Romans 8:2 -- Law of the Spirit of Life

> **8:2** For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.

**Parallel to James:** Paul's "law of the Spirit of life" that makes "free" is conceptually parallel to James' "law of liberty." Both involve a law that brings freedom.

### Romans 13:8-10 -- Love Fulfills the Law

> **13:8** Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
> **13:9** For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if [there be] any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
> **13:10** Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law.

**Parallel to James:** Paul quotes the SAME Decalogue commands (including "Thou shalt not commit adultery" and "Thou shalt not kill" that James quotes in 2:11) and the SAME "love thy neighbour" command (that James calls "the royal law" in 2:8). For both Paul and James, love FULFILLS the law by keeping its specific commandments.

### 1 Corinthians 9:21 -- Under the Law to Christ

> **9:21** To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.

### 2 Corinthians 3:17 -- Spirit and Liberty

> **3:17** Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.

### Galatians 2:4,12 -- Liberty in Christ / Those from James

> **2:4** And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
> **2:12** For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.

### Galatians 5:1,13-14 -- Liberty and Love

> **5:1** Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
> **5:13** For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only [use] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
> **5:14** For all the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

**Parallel to James:** Gal 5:14 quotes the SAME Lev 19:18 command that James calls "the royal law" (Jas 2:8). Paul connects this love-command to "liberty" (5:1,13) -- the same pairing James makes in "law of liberty."

### Galatians 6:2 -- The Law of Christ

> **6:2** Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.

### 1 Peter 2:16 -- Free, Servants of God

> **2:16** As free, and not using [your] liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.

### 2 Peter 2:19 -- False Liberty

> **2:19** While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.

### 1 John 2:3-4 -- Keeping Commandments

> **2:3** And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
> **2:4** He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

### 1 John 3:4 -- Sin Is Transgression of the Law

> **3:4** Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.

**Parallel to James:** John defines sin as anomia (lawlessness/transgression of the law). James calls those who violate the law parabatai (transgressors, Jas 2:9,11). Both identify sin in terms of the law.

### 1 John 5:3 -- Commandments Not Grievous

> **5:3** For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.

**Parallel to James:** "His commandments are not grievous" corresponds to James' concept that the law is "of liberty" -- it does not burden but liberates.

### Romans 3:31 -- Establishing the Law

> **3:31** Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.

### 1 Corinthians 7:19 -- Keeping Commandments

> **7:19** Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
