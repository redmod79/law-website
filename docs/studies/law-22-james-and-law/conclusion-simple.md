# James and the Law

A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence

---

The book of James is one of the most direct and practical epistles in the New Testament, and it contains a surprisingly rich teaching about God's law. James uses words and phrases for the law that appear nowhere else in the Bible -- calling it "the perfect law of liberty," "the royal law," and identifying God as "one lawgiver." But what exactly does James mean by these phrases? What law is he talking about, and what does he say about its authority, its content, and its role in the life of believers? This study examines the three major passages in James that address the law (James 1:22-25, James 2:1-13, and James 4:11-12) to answer those questions directly from the text.

## The Perfect Law of Liberty

James introduces his teaching about the law with a striking image. He compares the law to a mirror -- a person who hears the word but does not act on it is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror and immediately forgets what he looks like. Then James makes his key statement:

> But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. (James 1:25)

Several things stand out here. First, James calls the law "perfect" -- the Greek word means complete, whole, lacking nothing. This echoes the Old Testament description in Psalm 19:7: "The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul." Second, he calls it the law "of liberty" -- not a law that enslaves, but one that sets free. This resonates with Psalm 119:45: "And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts." Third, James says the person who looks into this law and continues in it -- who actually does what it says -- will be blessed. The law is something to be looked into, continued in, and obeyed, with a promise of blessing attached.

The word James uses for "looketh into" is the same Greek word used for Peter stooping down to look intently into the empty tomb (Luke 24:12) and for angels desiring to look into the mystery of salvation (1 Peter 1:12). It describes careful, deliberate, engaged examination -- not a casual glance.

## The Royal Law

In James chapter 2, the discussion turns to partiality. James warns against favoring the rich over the poor in the assembly. Then he grounds his argument in the law:

> If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well. (James 2:8)

James calls the law "royal" -- a word meaning "pertaining to a king." This is the law of the King, God himself. And James identifies its content "according to the scripture" by quoting Leviticus 19:18, the command to love your neighbor as yourself. The phrase "according to the scripture" is important: it locates this law in the Old Testament, not in some new or separate revelation.

But James does not stop with the love command. He immediately warns:

> But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. (James 2:9)

Showing partiality is sin, and the law itself convicts the offender as a transgressor. The law is not merely a suggestion or ideal; it has the authority to identify and convict sin.

## The Whole Law and Its Content

James then makes one of the most striking statements in the epistle about the law's nature:

> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. (James 2:10)

The law is an indivisible whole. You cannot pick and choose which parts to obey. Violation of any one point makes a person guilty of all. James then illustrates what he means by "the whole law":

> For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. (James 2:11)

This is a critical verse for understanding which law James is discussing. When he illustrates the "whole law," he reaches for the Ten Commandments -- specifically the seventh commandment ("Do not commit adultery," Exodus 20:14) and the sixth commandment ("Do not kill," Exodus 20:13). He does not illustrate with ceremonial regulations about sacrifices, dietary rules, or ritual purity. Every piece of content James identifies as belonging to his "royal law" and "law of liberty" comes from the moral law: the love command from Leviticus 19:18 and commandments from the Decalogue.

James also makes a point about who spoke these commands: "he that said...said also." God himself is identified as the direct speaker of both commandments. The Decalogue has a unique characteristic in Scripture -- God spoke it directly to the people (Exodus 20:1; Deuteronomy 5:4, 22). James appeals to this fact as the basis for the law's indivisibility: the same divine speaker issued both commands, so violating one offends against the authority behind all.

## The Law as a Standard of Future Judgment

James draws a practical conclusion from all of this:

> So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. (James 2:12)

This verse contains both a command and a warning. The command is in the imperative mood -- "speak" and "do" -- meaning believers are to conform their speech and actions to this law right now. The warning is that this same law of liberty will be the standard at the final judgment. Believers are going to be judged by it. This is not a law that belonged to a past era; it is operative in the present and will be operative at the judgment.

James adds a note about mercy in this judgment:

> For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. (James 2:13)

The judgment by the law of liberty is real, but it includes the principle of mercy. Those who show mercy will find mercy at the judgment; those who do not will face judgment without it.

## Doers of the Law, Not Judges

In James chapter 4, the law comes up again in a different context -- the problem of speaking evil against one another:

> He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. (James 4:11)

James presents a sharp either/or. A person is either a doer of the law or a judge of the law. These are mutually exclusive. To speak evil of a brother is, in James' reasoning, to speak evil of the law itself -- because the law commands love toward the neighbor. And if a person sets himself up as a judge of the law, evaluating it rather than obeying it, he has abandoned his role as a doer.

The prohibition against "judging the law" assumes something important: the law is in force. You cannot meaningfully "judge" a law that no longer applies. The very act of warning people not to judge the law only makes sense if the law retains its authority.

James then grounds the law's authority in its source:

> There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another? (James 4:12)

The word "lawgiver" (nomothetes in Greek) appears only here in the entire New Testament. God alone is the lawgiver. He alone has the authority to save and to destroy. No human being has the standing to sit in judgment over God's law.

## James and Paul: Agreement, Not Conflict

Some have suggested that James and Paul are at odds on the law -- that James teaches obedience to the law while Paul teaches freedom from it. But a careful comparison of their actual words shows remarkable agreement. Paul writes:

> Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. (Romans 13:8-9)

Paul quotes the same Leviticus 19:18 command that James calls "the royal law." Paul lists the same Decalogue commands James cites (plus additional ones) as the content that love fulfills. Both writers use the same vocabulary -- words like "transgressor," "hearer," and "doer" -- and both treat the moral law as authoritative and operative. Paul himself wrote, "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law" (Romans 3:31). The supposed conflict between James and Paul on the law does not hold up when their actual statements are compared.

It is also worth noting that James, at the Jerusalem Council recorded in Acts 15, did not impose the full ceremonial law on Gentile converts. He distinguished between moral requirements and ceremonial regulations. And in Acts 21:20, the believing Jews under James' leadership were described as "all zealous of the law," with James advising Paul to demonstrate that he also walked orderly and kept the law (Acts 21:24).

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

Honest study requires acknowledging what the text does not address:

- James does not explicitly mention the Sabbath anywhere in his epistle. The question of the Sabbath cannot be resolved from James alone.
- James does not explicitly define the boundary between the "royal law" / "law of liberty" and other categories of Old Testament law. His content identifications are all from the moral law (the love command and Decalogue commands), but he does not provide a systematic statement about which Old Testament laws are and are not included.
- James does not explicitly explain why he calls the law "royal." The connection to God as King and to the kingdom mentioned in James 2:5 ("heirs of the kingdom") can be reasonably drawn, but James does not spell it out.
- James does not explicitly say that "judging the law" refers to any particular modern theological position. His immediate context is about speaking evil of a brother.
- James does not use the word "new" for the law. He never describes his "perfect law of liberty" as a replacement for an older law. He locates it "according to the scripture" in the Old Testament.

## Conclusion

James teaches that God's law is "the perfect law of liberty" and "the royal law" -- a law whose content he identifies by direct quotation as the love command from Leviticus 19:18 and the sixth and seventh commandments from Exodus 20:13-14. He presents this law as complete, liberating, and indivisible. He affirms that it is operative in the present -- believers are commanded to do it, not to judge it -- and that it will serve as the standard of judgment at the last day. He identifies God as the sole lawgiver whose authority stands behind every commandment.

Every explicit statement and direct implication in James about the law supports its continuation. No statement in James supports its abolition. The arguments that James' "law of liberty" is a new replacement law, or that James and Paul contradict each other on the law, require adding ideas to the text that James himself does not express and, in some cases, contradict what he does say. James' teaching on the law is clear, consistent, and unified: the moral law of God continues, and believers are to be its doers.
