## Question
What does James teach about the law? Investigate "the perfect law of liberty" (Jas 1:25), the "royal law" with Decalogue citations (Jas 2:8-12), and judging the law (Jas 4:11-12). What law does James identify as the "law of liberty"? Is it the Decalogue, a new law, or something else?

**Key note for analysis:** Nave's lists JAS 1:25 under "General scriptures concerning" the LAW. The "TEMPORARY" subheading lists passages that may argue the law was temporary, but notably does NOT include any James passage -- James is only under the "general/continuing" category.

### LIBERTY
- Proclaimed in the year of jubilee LEV 25:10; JER 34:8,15-17
- Political JDG 17:6; 21:25; ACT 22:28
- See JUBILEE
- FIGURATIVE ISA 61:2; 63:4; LUK 4:19; JHN 8:32,33,36; GAL 3:28; EPH 6:8; COL 3:11

**Key note for analysis:** The figurative uses of liberty include Jesus' proclamation of liberty from Isa 61 (Luk 4:19) and the truth setting one free (Jhn 8:32,36). The OT jubilee "liberty" (deror, H1865) provides background for James' "law of liberty."

### COMMANDMENTS
- General scriptures concerning EXO 13:8-10; 20:3-17; DEU 4:5,9,10; 5:6-21; 6:4-9; 11:18-21; 32:46,47; JOS 8:30-35; 2CH 17:7-9; NEH 8:2-8; PSA 78:1-7; PRO 3:3,4; 6:20,21; 7:1-4; ISA 57:8; JER 11:4; ZEC 7:9,10; 8:16,17
- PRECEPTS OF JESUS (explicitly stated or implied) MAT 5:16,22-24,27-48; 6:1-4,6-8,16-25,31-34; 7:1-29; 10:5-42; 16:24; 18:8-10,15-17,21,22; 19:16-19; 20:25-28; 22:21,34-40; 24:42-51; 25:34-46; MRK 6:7-11; 8:34; 9:35,38,39,42-50; 10:9,11,12,17-22; 11:22; 12:17; 13:33-37; LUK 6:27-42; 10:28-37; 12:12-31; JHN 7:24; 13:34,35; 14:11,15,23,24; 15:2,4,5,7-12,14,17,20-22

- OTHER APOSTLES -- PRECEPTS OF, EXPLICITLY STATED OR IMPLIED IN DIDACTIC EPISTLES: **JAS 1:16,19,21,22; 2:1-4,8-12; 3:1; 4:7-11,13-15; 5:7-12,16**; 1PE 1:13-17; 2:11-25; 3:8-12,15-17; 4:1-16; 5:1-3,5-9; 2PE 1:5-7,10; 3:14,18; 1JN 2:15,28; 3:10-23; 4:1,7,8,11,12,15,16,21; 5:21; 2JN 1:5,6; 3JN 1:11; Jude 1:3,4,20-23; REV 3:11,18,19; 22:17
- OF MEN ISA 29:13; MAT 15:3-20; MRK 7:2-23; ROM 14:1-6,10-23; 1TI 4:1-3

**Key note for analysis:** James' instructions (Jas 1:16-2:12; 4:7-11) are categorized here as apostolic COMMANDMENTS. James 2:8-12 specifically is listed under "Other Apostles' Precepts." The distinction between divine commandments and "commandments of men" is significant.

### JUDGE
- Appointed by the Persians EZR 7:25
- Kings and other rulers as judges 2SA 8:15; 15:2; 1KI 3:16-28; 10:9; PSA 72:1-4; MAT 27:11-26
- Priests and Levites as judges DEU 17:9; 2CH 19:8; EZK 44:23,24; MAT 26:57-62
- CHARACTER OF, AND PRECEPTS RELATING TO EXO 18:21,22; 22:9,28; LEV 19:15; DEU 1:12-17; 16:18-20; 17:8-11; 19:16-19; 25:1-3; 1SA 2:25; 8:3; 1KI 3:9; 2CH 19:5-10; PSA 58:1,2; 72:1,2,4,12-14; 82:2-4; PRO 24:23; ISA 5:22,23; 28:5,6; EZK 44:24; DAN 9:12; MIC 7:3; ZEP 3:3; JHN 7:24
- CORRUPT, INSTANCES OF: Eli's sons, Samuel's sons, the judges of Jezreel, Pilate, Felix
- GOD AS -- See GOD, JUDGE

**Key note for analysis:** The JUDGE topic connects to Jas 4:12 ("one lawgiver...who is able to save and to destroy") and the precept that judgment belongs to God (DEU 1:17 "the judgment is God's"). James 4:12 identifies the same person as both "lawgiver" (nomothetes) and "judge" (krites).

### NEIGHBOR
- General scriptures concerning EXO 20:16; 23:4,5; LEV 6:2-5; 19:13,16-18; DEU 22:1-4; PSA 15:1-3; PRO 3:28,29; ISA 58:6-14; JER 22:13; ZEC 8:16,17; MAT 7:12; 19:19; 22:39; 25:34-46; MRK 12:31; LUK 10:25-37; ROM 13:9,10; 15:2; GAL 5:14; 6:10; HEB 13:3; **JAS 2:8,9**

**Key note for analysis:** James 2:8-9 is directly listed under NEIGHBOR. The "royal law" James cites IS "thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (Lev 19:18), which is also the source for Mat 22:39, Rom 13:9, and Gal 5:14.

### UNCHARITABLENESS (= JUDGING)
- General scriptures concerning ISA 29:20,21; MAT 7:1-5; LUK 6:37-42; 12:57; JHN 7:24; 8:7; ROM 2:1; 14:1-15; 1CO 4:3-5,7; 13:1-6; **JAS 4:11,12**
- See ACCUSATION, FALSE
- See CHARITABLENESS
- See SLANDER
- See SPEAKING, EVIL

**Key note for analysis:** James 4:11-12 is listed as a key scripture against uncharitable judging. The cross-references (MAT 7:1-5; ROM 2:1; ROM 14:1-15) provide the NT context for James' prohibition against judging the law/judging one's brother.

### JAMES
- 1. An apostle, Son of Zebedee and Salome. Brother of John and a fisherman. Called to be an apostle. Surnamed Boanerges by Jesus. Intimate companion of Jesus. Martyred ACT 12:2.
- 2. An apostle, Son of Alphaeus. Brother of Jesus (MAT 13:55; GAL 1:19; 2:9,12). Witness of Christ's resurrection (1CO 15:7). **Addresses the gathering at Jerusalem in favor of liberty for the Gentile converts ACT 15:13-21.** Disciples sent by, to Antioch GAL 2:12. Hears of the success attending Paul's ministry ACT 21:18,19. **Epistle of JAS 1:1.**
- 3. Brother of Jesus MAT 13:55; MRK 6:3; GAL 1:19

**Key note for analysis:** James (the author of the epistle) is identified as the brother of Jesus who spoke at the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15:13-21) "in favor of liberty for the Gentile converts." This same James who advocated liberty for Gentiles also wrote of "the perfect law OF LIBERTY" -- his vocabulary is consistent across Acts and his epistle.

### SLANDER (relevant to Jas 4:11 katalaleo)
- UNCLASSIFIED SCRIPTURES: EXO 23:1; DEU 22:13-19; JOB 5:21; PSA 41:6-9; 50:20; 101:5; PRO 10:18; 25:23; JER 6:28; 9:4; ROM 1:29,30; 1CO 4:13; 6:10; 2CO 12:20; **JAS 4:11**; 1PE 2:1; 2PE 2:10

**Key note for analysis:** James 4:11's use of katalaleo ("speak evil of") is classified under SLANDER. The connection James draws between speaking evil of a brother and speaking evil of the law is unique in the NT.
