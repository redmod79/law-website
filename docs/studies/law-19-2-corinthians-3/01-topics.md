## Question
Does 2 Corinthians 3 teach that the Ten Commandments were "done away"? Investigate the diakonia (ministry/ministration) contrast, the katargeo grammar, the glory/doxa theme, the veil imagery, and the stone-to-heart transition.

### TABLES (Stone Tablets)
Referenced under DECALOGUE: "Tables of Testimony" (EXO 31:18; 34:29; 40:20)
Referenced under STONES: "Commandments engraved upon" (EXO 24:12; 31:18; 34:1-4; DEU 4:13; 5:22; 9:9-11; 10:1-3)

## Key Observations from Nave's
1. **GLORY**: Nave's explicitly notes "Of the gospel exceeds that of the law" citing 2CO 3:9,10 -- and "Is the work of the Holy Spirit" citing 2CO 3:18. The glory theme is central.
2. **DECALOGUE**: Written by God, called "Words of the Covenant" and "Tables of Testimony" -- uniquely authored by God's finger.
3. **COVENANT**: The Ten Commandments are explicitly identified as "the covenant" (EXO 34:28; DEU 5:2,3; 9:9), distinct from the broader Mosaic law.
4. **SECOND COVENANT**: Nave's lists JER 31:31-34 and HEB 8:4-13 as the "second covenant" passages -- these are the new covenant promises that write the law on hearts.
5. **VEIL**: Nave's links Moses' veil (EXO 34:33,35) directly to 2CO 3:13-16 -- Paul's interpretation.
6. **STONES**: The figurative use of stone for "the impenitent heart" (EZK 36:26) connects to the stone-to-heart transition in 2 Cor 3:3.
