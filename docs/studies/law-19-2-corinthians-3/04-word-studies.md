## [G1248](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1248/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- diakonia (ministry / ministration)

**Original:** diakonia
**Transliteration:** diakonia
**Pronunciation:** dee-ak-on-ee'-ah
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** From diakonos; attendance (as a servant, etc.); figuratively. Ministry, service, ministration.
**BLB Count:** 34 NT occurrences
**Gender:** FEMININE

### Translations (36 total instances)
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| ministry | 12 | 33.3% |
| ministration | 4 | 11.1% |
| ministering | 3 | 8.3% |
| service | 3 | 8.3% |
| the ministry | 3 | 8.3% |
| serving | 1 | 2.8% |
| relief | 1 | 2.8% |
| office | 1 | 2.8% |
| administrations | 1 | 2.8% |
| administration | 1 | 2.8% |

### Key Verses in 2 Corinthians 3
- **v.7** -- "the **ministration** (diakonia) of death" (Nom Sg Feminine)
- **v.8** -- "the **ministration** (diakonia) of the spirit"
- **v.9** -- "the **ministration** (diakonia) of condemnation" / "the **ministration** (diakonia) of righteousness"

### Critical Observation
diakonia is FEMININE in gender. This is important for grammatical agreement analysis in 2 Cor 3:7-13. The word nomos (law) is MASCULINE and does NOT appear in 2 Corinthians 3. The subject throughout is the diakonia (ministry/administration), not the law itself.

## [G1391](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1391/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- doxa (glory)

**Original:** doxa
**Transliteration:** doxa
**Pronunciation:** dox'-ah
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** From the base of dokeo; glory (as very apparent), in a wide application.
**BLB Count:** 168 occurrences (OT + NT)
**Gender:** FEMININE

### Translations (142 total KJV instances)
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| glory | 97 | 68.3% |
| the glory | 12 | 8.5% |
| glorious | 9 | 6.3% |
| of glory | 8 | 5.6% |
| honour | 2 | 1.4% |
| worship | 1 | 0.7% |
| praise | 1 | 0.7% |

### Key Occurrences in 2 Corinthians 3
- **v.7** -- "was **glorious** (en doxe)" / "the **glory** (ten doxan) of his countenance"
- **v.8** -- "be rather **glorious** (en doxe)"
- **v.9** -- "be **glory** (doxa)" / "exceed in **glory** (doxe)"
- **v.10** -- "that which was made **glorious** (dedoxasmenon)" / "the **glory** (doxes) that excelleth"
- **v.11** -- "[was] **glorious** (dia doxes)" / "[is] **glorious** (en doxe)"
- **v.18** -- "**glory** (doxan) of the Lord" / "from **glory** (doxes) to **glory** (doxan)"

### Critical Grammatical Note
doxa is FEMININE. In v.7, the participle katargoumenen ("being done away") is Acc Sg FEMININE -- it agrees with doxan (glory, Acc Sg Feminine), NOT with nomos (law, masculine) or diakonia (ministry, feminine nominative).

## [G2571](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2571/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- kalumma (veil)

**Original:** kalumma
**Transliteration:** kalumma
**Pronunciation:** kal'-oo-mah
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun
**Definition:** From kalupto; a cover, i.e. veil.
**BLB Count:** 4 NT occurrences (all in 2 Cor 3)
**Gender:** NEUTER

### All Occurrences
| Verse | KJV Translation |
|-------|----------------|
| 2 Corinthians 3:13 | "a vail" (Acc Sg Neuter) |
| 2 Corinthians 3:14 | "the same vail" (Nom Sg Neuter) |
| 2 Corinthians 3:15 | "the vail" |
| 2 Corinthians 3:16 | "the vail" |

### Critical Note
kalumma is NEUTER. In v.14, katargeitai (Present Passive Indicative 3rd Sg) has the neuter kalumma as its most proximate subject: "the same veil...is done away in Christ." The verb has no gender marking in 3rd singular indicative form, but the contextual subject is the veil (neuter), not the old covenant (feminine diatheke).

### Compare with [G2665](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2665/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- katapetasma (temple veil)
katapetasma (neuter) = the temple curtain/veil (Matt 27:51; Mk 15:38; Lk 23:45; Heb 6:19; 9:3; 10:20). This is distinct from kalumma (personal/spiritual veil in 2 Cor 3). Different words for different veils.

## [G1795](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1795/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- entupoo (engrave / enstamp)

**Original:** entupoo
**Transliteration:** entupoo
**Pronunciation:** en-too-po'-o
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** From en and a derivative of tupos; to enstamp, i.e. engrave.
**BLB Count:** 1 NT occurrence

### Only Occurrence
- **2 Corinthians 3:7** -- "engraven" (enteteupomene -- Perfect Passive Participle, Nom Sg FEMININE)

### Critical Grammar Note
In 2 Cor 3:7, enteteupomene is parsed as Perfect Passive Participle, Nominative Singular FEMININE. It modifies diakonia (feminine), which is the grammatical subject: "the ministry (diakonia, fem) of death, in letters having-been-engraved (enteteupomene, fem) on stones." The engraving is attributed to the diakonia, not independently to the law.

### Compare with [G2631](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2631/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- katakrima (condemnation -- the verdict)

**Pronunciation:** li-toorg-ee'-ah
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** From leitourgos; public function (as priest/liturgist).

| 2 Corinthians 9:12 | "service" (this service of ministry) |
| Philippians 2:17 | "service" |
| Philippians 2:30 | "service" |
| **Hebrews 8:6** | **"ministry" (a more excellent ministry)** |
| Hebrews 9:21 | "ministry" |

### Note
leitourgia (priestly public function) is distinct from diakonia (general ministry/service). In 2 Cor 3, Paul uses diakonia, not leitourgia. Hebrews 8:6 uses leitourgia for Christ's priesthood.

## [G4109](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4109/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- plax (tablet / flat surface)

**Original:** plax
**Transliteration:** plax
**Pronunciation:** plax
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** A moulding-board, i.e. flat surface ("plate", or tablet).
**BLB Count:** 3 occurrences

### All Occurrences
| Verse | Context |
|-------|---------|
| **2 Corinthians 3:3** | **"tables (plaxin) of stone" AND "tables (plaxin) of the heart"** |
| Hebrews 9:4 | "tables (plakes) of the covenant" |

### Critical Note
The SAME word plax is used for both the stone tablets and the heart tablets in 2 Cor 3:3. The content is transferred from one plax to another -- from stone to heart. The word itself does not change; only the medium changes.

## [G1121](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1121/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- gramma (letter / writing)

**Original:** gramma
**Transliteration:** gramma
**Pronunciation:** gram'-mah
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun
**Definition:** From grapho; a writing, i.e. a letter, note, epistle, book, etc.; plural: learning.
**BLB Count:** 15 occurrences
**Gender:** NEUTER

### Key Occurrences
| Verse | KJV Translation |
|-------|----------------|
| Luke 16:6 | "bill" |
| John 5:47 | "writings" (Moses' writings) |
| John 7:15 | "letters" (How knoweth this man letters?) |
| Acts 26:24 | "learning" (much learning doth make thee mad) |
| Acts 28:21 | "letters" (neither received letters) |
| **Romans 2:27** | **"the letter" (uncircumcision...fulfil the law, judge thee who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law)** |
| **Romans 2:29** | **"the letter" (in the spirit, and not in the letter)** |
| **Romans 7:6** | **"the letter" (serve in newness of spirit, not in the oldness of the letter)** |
| **2 Corinthians 3:6** | **"the letter" (not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth)** |
| **2 Corinthians 3:7** | **"letters" (in letters having been engraved on stones)** |
| Galatians 6:11 | "a letter" (how large a letter I have written) |
| 2 Timothy 3:15 | "scriptures" (the holy scriptures) |

### Critical Note
gramma in 2 Cor 3:6 ("the letter killeth") does not mean the law is evil. Compare with Rom 7:6 which uses the same gramma/pneuma contrast. The "letter" (external written code without the Spirit) kills because it condemns without providing the power to obey. The "spirit" (the same law internalized by the Holy Spirit) gives life.

**Original:** charath
**Transliteration:** charath
**Pronunciation:** khaw-rath'
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** A primitive root; to engrave.
**BLB Count:** 1 occurrence (in KJV translation data)

### Key Occurrence
- **Exodus 32:16** -- "the writing [was] the writing of God, **graven** (charath) upon the tables"

### [H3789](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3789/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- kathab (write)

**Original:** kathab
**Transliteration:** kathab
**Pronunciation:** kaw-thab'
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** A primitive root; to grave, by implication, to write (describe, inscribe, prescribe, subscribe).
**BLB Count:** 223 occurrences

### Key Occurrences for This Study
| Verse | Context |
|-------|---------|
| Exodus 24:12 | "commandments which I have **written**" (God writes) |
| Exodus 31:18 | "**written** with the finger of God" |
| Exodus 32:15 | "the tables [were] **written** on both their sides" |
| Exodus 34:1 | "I will **write** upon [these] tables" |
| Exodus 34:27 | "**Write** thou these words" (Moses writes additional words) |
| Deuteronomy 9:10 | "two tables of stone **written** with the finger of God" |
| Deuteronomy 10:4 | "he **wrote** on the tables...the ten commandments" |
| **Jeremiah 31:33** | **"I will put my law in their inward parts, and **write** it in their hearts"** |

### Critical Note
The same verb kathab is used for God writing the Decalogue on stone (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10; 10:4) AND for God writing the law on hearts (Jer 31:33). The content does not change; the medium changes from stone to heart.

### [H8451](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8451/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- torah (law / instruction)

**Original:** torah (towrah)
**Transliteration:** towrah
**Pronunciation:** to-raw'
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** From yarah; a precept or statute, especially the Decalogue or Pentateuch.
**BLB Count:** 219 occurrences

### Key Occurrence
- **Jeremiah 31:33** -- "I will put **my law** (torati) in their inward parts"

### Critical Note
In Jer 31:33, God says "my law" (torati) -- possessive. This is God's own torah that He will write on hearts. The new covenant does not introduce a different law; it writes the SAME divine torah on a different medium (hearts instead of stone).
