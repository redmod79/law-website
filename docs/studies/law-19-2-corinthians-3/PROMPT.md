# law-19: 2 Corinthians 3 -- Were the Ten Commandments "Done Away"?

## Question
Does 2 Corinthians 3 teach that the Ten Commandments were "done away"? Investigate the diakonia (ministry/ministration) contrast: the "ministration of death, written and engraven in stones" (v.7) vs the "ministration of the spirit" (v.8). Examine the katargeo (done away/abolished) grammar -- what is the grammatical subject of katargeo in v.7, v.11, v.13, v.14? Is it the law itself, or the glory (doxa) of Moses' face? Check neuter/feminine grammatical agreement. Study the veil imagery (v.13-16) -- "the veil is done away in Christ" (v.14). Does Paul say the law written on stone is abolished, or that the glory/ministry associated with its condemnation function is superseded by a more glorious ministry?

## Series Context
This is study 19 in a 31-study series on the Law of God. The series investigates whether God's moral law (Ten Commandments, including Sabbath) continues or was abolished at the cross. Both positions agree ceremonial/civil laws ceased -- the debate is ONLY about the moral law.

## Prior Study Analysis

### Highly Relevant Prior Studies

The study database returned **47 chunks for "katargeo"**, **14 chunks for "diakonia"**, and **23 chunks for "doxa"** -- indicating extensive prior analysis on these exact Greek terms in the context of 2 Corinthians 3. The following prior studies are directly relevant:

#### 1. law-08-abolished-at-cross (CRITICAL -- most relevant)
- Already analyzed 2 Cor 3:7-13 as one of the seven primary NT abolition passages
- **Key finding:** E32/N5 -- katargoumenen in v.7 is FEMININE, agreeing with doxan (glory, feminine), NOT nomos (law, masculine). Grammar says GLORY was done away, not the law.
- **E11 (Master E048):** "The ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious...which glory (ten doxan...ten katargoumenen) was to be done away" -- classified Neutral (the grammar makes it about glory, not law continuation or cessation)
- **E12:** In v.11, katargoumenon is NEUTER, matching neither diakonia (fem) nor nomos (masc) -- refers to the fading glory-system
- **I-B Resolution I6/I046:** "2 Cor 3:7-13 abolishes the Decalogue" resolved STRONG toward Continues -- grammar proves GLORY is done away, not the law
- **Word study:** Full parsing of 2 Cor 3:7 -- he diakonia (G1248) = Nom Sg Feminine, tou thanatou (G2288) = Gen Sg Masculine, katargoumenen = Pres Pass Ptcp Acc Sg FEMININE (agrees with doxan)
- **Word study:** Full parsing of 2 Cor 3:11 -- to katargoumenon (G2673) = Pres Pass Ptcp Nom Sg NEUTER, to menon (G3306) = Pres Act Ptcp Nom Sg NEUTER
- **N1:** None of the seven primary abolition passages explicitly names the Decalogue as the thing abolished
- **N7/N047:** Paul uses katargeo to abolish dogma-qualified ordinances (Eph 2:15) while emphatically denying abolishing "the law" (Rom 3:31)
- Conclusion path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-08-abolished-at-cross/CONCLUSION.md

#### 2. law-11-written-on-hearts (HIGHLY relevant)
- Analyzed 2 Cor 3:1-18 as the stone-to-heart contrast passage
- **N057:** Only the Decalogue was written on stone tablets -- when Paul references "tables of stone" (2 Cor 3:3), the referent is necessarily the Decalogue
- **N058:** Heb 10:1-18 removes sacrificial system AND writes law on hearts in the same argument
- Analyzed katargeo dual usage: in 2 Cor 3:7, 11, 13 the grammatical referent is the glory or the ministration, not the law
- **E305:** Stone-to-heart transition in 2 Cor 3:3 identifies what was on stone as the content transferred to hearts
- Conclusion path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-11-written-on-hearts/CONCLUSION.md

#### 3. law-09-old-covenant-new-covenant (RELEVANT)
- Analyzed 2 Cor 3:1-18 as letter vs. spirit / glory contrast
- Established that the old covenant's fault was with the people (Heb 8:8, "finding fault with THEM"), not with the law
- The new covenant writes the SAME law on hearts (Jer 31:33, "MY law/torah")
- 2 Cor 3:3: content moves from stone to heart; medium changes, content remains
- Conclusion path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-09-old-covenant-new-covenant/CONCLUSION.md

#### 4. 2-corinthians-3-ministration (DIRECTLY ON TOPIC -- pre-series study)
- This exact question was studied previously (pre-law-series study)
- Full grammatical analysis of katargeo in vv.7, 11, 13, 14
- Full diakonia contrast analysis (ministration of death/condemnation vs. ministration of spirit/righteousness)
- Full veil (kalumma) imagery analysis (vv.13-18)
- Key finding: nomos (law) NEVER appears in 2 Corinthians 3 -- the subject is diakonia (ministry/administration)
- Conclusion path: D:/bible/bible-studies/2-corinthians-3-ministration/CONCLUSION.md

#### 5. Other relevant law-series studies
- **law-01-gods-moral-law:** Analyzed 2 Cor 3:6-14 as a "temporary classification" passage
- **law-03-exodus-20-vs-later-laws:** Analyzed 2 Cor 3:3-14 "Written and Engraven in Stones" -- the law written on stone is the Decalogue, distinct from Moses' book
- **law-07-law-of-moses:** Analyzed 2 Cor 3:7 -- diakonia of death written on stone was glorious but the glory was done away
- **law-10-new-covenant-and-law:** Katargeo in Rom 3:31 vs. Eph 2:15 -- same verb, different applications
- **law-16-paul-and-law-in-romans:** histemi vs. katargeo analysis (Rom 3:31)

## Key Research Angles

### Angle 1: The Diakonia (Ministry/Ministration) Contrast
Paul's argument in 2 Cor 3:7-9 is structured around four named ministrations (diakoniai):
- v.7-8: "ministration of death" vs. "ministration of the spirit"
- v.9: "ministration of condemnation" vs. "ministration of righteousness"
The word nomos (law) does NOT appear in 2 Corinthians 3. The subject throughout is diakonia (G1248).

**Research needed:**
- Retrieve full text of 2 Cor 3:1-18 with verse-by-verse analysis
- Retrieve all NT uses of diakonia (G1248) -- 22 occurrences
- Determine: is diakonia ever used as a synonym for the law itself?
- Compare: how does Paul distinguish diakonia from nomos in his vocabulary?

### Angle 2: Katargeo Grammar -- What Is the Subject?
The verb katargeo (G2673) appears four times in 2 Cor 3. Prior studies identified:
- v.7: katargoumenen -- FEMININE Acc Sg, agreeing with doxan (glory, feminine), NOT nomos (masculine)
- v.11: to katargoumenon -- NEUTER Nom Sg, matching neither diakonia (fem) nor nomos (masc)
- v.13: katargoumenou -- NEUTER Gen Sg
- v.14: katargeitai -- 3rd Sg Present Passive (subject: kalumma/veil, neuter)

**Research needed:**
- Independent verification of all four katargeo forms and their grammatical agreements
- Retrieve all 27 NT occurrences of katargeo (G2673) with full context
- What does katargeo modify in EACH occurrence? Build complete usage table
- Especially: Rom 3:31 uses same verb and Paul emphatically denies making void the law
- Check: does katargeo in 2 Cor 3 mean "abolish permanently" or "supersede/render inactive"?

### Angle 3: The Glory (Doxa) Theme
The word doxa (glory) dominates the passage (vv.7-11, 18). Paul's argument:
- The old ministration "was glorious" (en doxe) -- Paul affirms the law's glory
- The glory of Moses' face was fading (katargoumenen -- what was done away)
- The new ministry has "surpassing glory" (v.10)
- "That which remaineth" (to menon) is glorious (v.11)

**Research needed:**
- Retrieve Exodus 34:29-35 (the source narrative) with full context
- How does Paul's interpretation of Exodus 34 in 2 Cor 3 differ from the OT text itself?
- What was the glory on Moses' face? Was it temporary by nature?
- Retrieve all uses of doxa in 2 Corinthians

### Angle 4: The Veil Imagery (vv.13-18)
Kalumma (G2571, veil) appears four times (vv.13-16). Paul's argument:
- Moses veiled his face to hide the fading glory (v.13)
- "The same veil" remains when the old testament is read (v.14)
- "The veil is upon their heart" (v.15) -- spiritual blindness
- "When it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away" (v.16)
- "We all, with open face beholding...the glory of the Lord, are changed" (v.18)

**Research needed:**
- In v.14, what is the grammatical subject of katargeitai? Is it the veil (kalumma) or the old covenant (palaia diatheke)?
- Retrieve all NT uses of kalumma and related forms
- What does "done away in Christ" mean -- what is done away? The veil? The covenant? The glory?
- The passage's conclusion (v.16-18) focuses on removing the veil and transformation -- NOT removing the law

### Angle 5: The Stone-to-Heart Transition (v.3)
2 Cor 3:3: "not in tables of stone (plaxin lithinais), but in fleshy tables of the heart (plaxin kardiais sarkinais)"
- Same word plax (G4109) for both surfaces
- Echoes Jer 31:33, Heb 8:10, Eze 36:26-27
- Only the Decalogue was written on stone (N057)

**Research needed:**
- Retrieve 2 Cor 3:3 and compare with Jer 31:33, Heb 8:10, Heb 10:16, Eze 36:26-27
- If the content on stone is abolished, what content is written on hearts?
- Does the stone-to-heart transition indicate abolition or relocation of the law?

### Angle 6: "The Letter Killeth" (v.6) -- What Does This Mean?
Gramma (G1121) vs. pneuma (G4151): "the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life"

**Research needed:**
- Is "the letter" the law itself, or the law in its external form without the Spirit?
- Compare Rom 7:6: "serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter"
- Compare Rom 8:2-4: "the law of the Spirit of life" fulfills "the righteousness of the law"
- Retrieve all NT uses of gramma

### Angle 7: Paul's Consistency -- Does He Abolish the Law Elsewhere?
The same Paul who writes 2 Cor 3 also writes:
- Rom 3:31: "Do we make void (katargeo) the law? God forbid: we establish the law"
- Rom 7:12: "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good"
- Rom 7:14: "The law is spiritual"
- Rom 8:4: "The righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us"
- 1 Cor 7:19: "Circumcision is nothing...but the keeping of the commandments of God"

**Research needed:**
- If Paul abolishes the Decalogue in 2 Cor 3, he contradicts himself in multiple other epistles
- Cross-reference Paul's law statements across Romans, 1 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians

### Angle 8: Counter-Arguments to Investigate
The Abolished position argues:
- The Decalogue is explicitly referenced ("written and engraven in stones") and the passage says something is "done away"
- "The ministration of death, written and engraven in stones" -- the Decalogue administration IS the Decalogue
- If the ministration/glory is done away but the law remains, Paul's argument has no force
- "That which is done away" (v.11) contrasted with "that which remaineth" = the old law vs. the new

**Research needed:**
- Investigate whether diakonia can be separated from its content (the law)
- Can a ministry be superseded while the underlying law continues?
- Investigate OT precedent: did the Levitical ministry change (Heb 7:12) while moral principles continued?

### Key Prior Study Conclusions
- **law-08:** No abolition passage names the Decalogue; grammar in 2 Cor 3:7 shows glory (not law) is done away
- **law-11:** Stone medium = Decalogue; same content is relocated from stone to hearts
- **law-09:** Old/new covenants differ in administration, not moral content; the law is the constant
- **2-cor-3-ministration (pre-series):** Comprehensive analysis concluding the passage does NOT abolish the Ten Commandments; it contrasts two administrations of the same law

## Differentiation from Prior Study

**IMPORTANT:** The pre-series study "2-corinthians-3-ministration" covered this exact question. However:
1. That study was NOT part of the law-series and did NOT use the law-series methodology (E/N/I classification, positional classification, I-B resolutions, verification phase, etc.)
2. Law-19 must apply the full law-series methodology including evidence DB integration
3. Law-19 has access to 18 prior law-series studies' evidence items to cross-reference
4. Law-19 should examine counter-arguments more deeply using the I-B resolution framework
5. Law-19 should produce new E/N/I items and integrate them with the master evidence file

The research agent should USE the prior study's findings as a starting point but must independently verify all claims through the tool chain and apply the full methodology framework.
