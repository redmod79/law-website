### gods-moral-law / law-01 (Score: 0.503)
Foundation study establishing Decalogue's unique markers. Seven unique markers distinguishing the Decalogue from all other laws: spoken by God directly, written by God's finger, written on stone, placed inside the Ark, called "the covenant," prefaced with "I am the LORD thy God," and consisting of ten words. Three independent channels attest the moral law: nature, conscience, direct revelation. 66 E-items, 7 N-items, 10 I-items.

## Other Law Series Studies Referenced

### law-02 (Pre-Sinai Moral Law)
Moral law preceded Sinai -- Gen 26:5 uses torah, mitsvah, chuqqah, mishmereth for Abraham's obedience. Rom 5:12-14 requires law before Sinai for sin to exist.

### law-04 (Ceremonial Laws)
Ceremonial laws differ from moral law in vocabulary (dogma vs. entole), purpose (typological vs. moral), duration markers, and NT treatment. Colossians 2:14 targets dogma (ordinances), not entole (commandments).

### law-08 (What Was Abolished at the Cross)
The NT uses dogma/cheirographon for what was nailed to the cross, never nomos/entole. The abolished items are the ceremonial handwriting of ordinances, not the moral commandments.

### law-09 (Old Covenant)
The old covenant was an arrangement/administration that changed, not the law content. The law itself was written on hearts under the new covenant.

### law-10 (New Covenant and Law)
The new covenant writes "MY law" (torati/nomous mou) on hearts -- same law, different location. Jeremiah 31:33 and Hebrews 8:10 use possessive "my law," identifying continuity. 46 E-items (26 Continues, 0 Abolished).

### law-11 (Written on Hearts)
The berith-Decalogue equation: "my law" = the Decalogue specifically, based on the covenant-law identity established in Deuteronomy and carried through Jeremiah to Hebrews.

### law-12 (Matthew 5:17-20)
Kataluo (G2647) means demolish/annul in all 17 NT uses. Pleroo (G4137) means fill full with meaning. Jesus's programmatic statement excludes abrogation of the law. The antitheses (Mat 5:21-48) deepen the commandments rather than replacing them. 21 E-items (14 Continues, 0 Abolished).
