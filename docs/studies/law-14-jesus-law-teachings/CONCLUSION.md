# What Did Jesus Specifically Teach About the Law and Commandments?

## Question
What did Jesus specifically teach about the law and commandments? Catalogue every instance: rich young ruler, greatest commandment, new commandment, keep my commandments, 1 John's reflections, anomia/lawlessness, weightier matters, law permanence. Did Jesus ever abolish any moral commandment?

## Summary Answer
Across all four Gospels and John's epistles, Jesus consistently affirms, deepens, and defends the moral law (Decalogue). He directs the rich young ruler to the Decalogue as the path to life (Mat 19:17-19). He identifies the two love commandments as the organizing principle on which all the law hangs (Mat 22:37-40). His "new commandment" (Jhn 13:34) uses kainos (G2537, new in quality), and John himself clarifies it is simultaneously "an old commandment from the beginning" (1 Jhn 2:7; 2 Jhn 1:5). Jesus equates "my commandments" with "my Father's commandments" (Jhn 15:10) using the same word (entole, G1785) used throughout for the Decalogue. John defines sin as anomia (lawlessness, 1 Jhn 3:4), and Jesus rejects "workers of anomia" at the judgment (Mat 7:23). Jesus affirms both the weightier and lighter matters of the law as obligatory (Mat 23:23). He states the law's permanence exceeds the cosmos (Luk 16:17; Mat 5:18). No passage in any Gospel records Jesus abolishing, revoking, or declaring obsolete any moral commandment of the Decalogue.

## Evidence Classification

Evidence items tracked in law-master-evidence.md.

INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by those who say the law continues, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by those who say the law is abolished, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says.
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.

### 1. Explicit Statements Table

Each E-item has been processed through Tree 1 (Tier Classification) and Tree 3 (E-Item Positional Classification) from the law-series methodology.

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Position | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | When asked which commandments lead to eternal life, Jesus names five specific Decalogue commandments (5th-9th) -- confirmed across all three synoptic parallels without variation in the core list. | Mat 19:18-19; Mrk 10:19; Luk 18:20 | Continues | E342 |
| E2 | Jesus presents "if thou wilt be perfect (teleios)" as an additional step beyond keeping the Decalogue commandments, not as a replacement for them. The commandment-keeping is accepted; the further condition is offered as addition. | Mat 19:21 | Neutral | E343 |
| E3 | The scribe states that love to God and neighbor is "more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices" -- explicitly distinguishing moral commands from ceremonial obligations -- and Jesus affirms: "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God." | Mrk 12:33-34 | Continues | E344 |
| E4 | Jesus says "Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live" -- presenting commandment-doing as the condition for life, structurally parallel to Mat 19:17. | Luk 10:28 | Continues | E345 |
| E5 | The word used for "new" in John's "new commandment" is [G2537](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2537/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (kainos = new in quality/freshness), not [G3501](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3501/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (neos = new in time). Textually observable lexical choice. | Jhn 13:34; 1 Jhn 2:7-8; 2 Jhn 1:5 | Neutral | E346 |
| E6 | The "new commandment" (Jhn 13:34) uses [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (entole) -- the same word used throughout for Jesus's commandments, the Father's commandments, and "the commandments of God" in Revelation. | Jhn 13:34; 14:15; 14:31; 15:10; Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14 | Neutral | E347 |
| E7 | John explicitly states the love commandment is "an old commandment which ye had from the beginning" (v.7) -- the same commandment he immediately also calls "a new commandment" (v.8). Simultaneously old in content and new in quality. | 1 Jhn 2:7-8 | Continues | E348 |
| E8 | John writes "not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another" -- explicitly denying neos-newness and pointing to pre-existing origin. | 2 Jhn 1:5-6 | Continues | E349 |
| E9 | Jesus states "If ye love me, keep my commandments" -- double definite article + possessive = emphatic specific reference -- linking love for Jesus to keeping His specific commandments. | Jhn 14:15 | Continues | E350 |
| E10 | Jesus says "as the Father gave me commandment (entolen), even so I do" -- placing Himself under the Father's entole and presenting His obedience as the model for disciples. | Jhn 14:31 | Continues | E351 |
| E11 | John states "hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments" / "He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar." Commandment-keeping is the test of knowing God. | 1 Jhn 2:3-4 | Continues | E352 |
| E12 | John connects commandment-keeping to answered prayer and mutual indwelling with God. | 1 Jhn 3:22-24 | Continues | E353 |
| E13 | At the eschatological judgment Jesus says "depart from me, ye that work iniquity (anomian, G458)" -- Present Participle + definite article -- rejecting those practicing anomia despite religious works. | Mat 7:23 | Continues | E354 |
| E14 | At the end of the world angels gather out of Christ's kingdom "them which do iniquity (anomian)" -- anomia is the operative exclusionary characteristic at the final harvest. | Mat 13:41 | Continues | E355 |
| E15 | Jesus characterizes the Pharisees as "full of hypocrisy and iniquity (anomias)" within, establishing anomia as an inner heart condition coexisting with external law-observance. | Mat 23:28 | Continues | E356 |
| E16 | Jesus says "because iniquity (anomia) shall abound, the love (agape) of many shall wax cold" -- causal connector (hoti) runs from abounding anomia to cooling agape. | Mat 24:12 | Continues | E357 |
| E17 | Jesus affirms BOTH weightier matters (judgment, mercy, faith) AND lighter matters (tithing herbs): "these ought ye to have done, AND NOT TO LEAVE THE OTHER UNDONE." Neither is abolished. | Mat 23:23; Luk 11:42 | Continues | E358 |
| E18 | In Antitheses 1-2, Jesus quotes two Decalogue commandments (6th, 7th) and extends each to heart-level application (anger, lust) -- deepening the standard, not revoking it. | Mat 5:21-28 | Continues | E359 |
| E19 | In Antithesis 6, Jesus corrects "hate thine enemy" -- a phrase not found in the OT text -- distinguishing the biblical commandment (Lev 19:18) from human tradition. | Mat 5:43-44 | Neutral | E360 |
| E20 | Jesus explicitly calls the 5th Decalogue commandment "the commandment of God" (entolen tou Theou) in both Mat 15:3 and Mrk 7:8,9,13 -- defending a specific Decalogue commandment as binding against the Corban tradition. | Mat 15:3-9; Mrk 7:8-13 | Continues | E361 |
| E21 | Jesus states "I know that his commandment is life everlasting" -- equating the Father's entole with everlasting life, paralleling Mat 19:17 and Luk 10:28. | Jhn 12:50 | Continues | E362 |
| E22 | Colossians 2:14 uses [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dogma, "ordinance/decree") for what was "nailed to the cross" -- not [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (entole, "commandment"). | Col 2:14 | Neutral | E363 |
| E23 | Ephesians 2:15 describes what was abolished as "the law of commandments contained in ordinances (en dogmasin)" -- the dogmatic/ordinance dimension was abolished. | Eph 2:15 | Neutral | E364 |
| E24 | Jesus identifies the Golden Rule as "the law and the prophets" (Mat 7:12) -- the same phrase used in Mat 5:17 and Mat 22:40. | Mat 7:12 | Continues | E365 |

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | Since Jesus uses the same word (entole) for "my commandments" and "my Father's commandments" in the same verse (Jhn 15:10), and presents His own keeping of the Father's commandments as the model for disciples, the text necessarily implies a single unified commandment-authority chain: Father's commandments -> Jesus's commandments -> disciples' commandment-keeping. | E293 (Jhn 15:10), E350 (Jhn 14:15), E351 (Jhn 14:31) | Continues | N072 |
| N2 | The equation "the sin IS the lawlessness" (he hamartia estin he anomia) in 1 Jhn 3:4 is a convertible definitional equation: both nouns carry the definite article with copulative estin. Every act of sin is necessarily an act of lawlessness, and every act of lawlessness is necessarily sin. | E023 (1 Jhn 3:4) | Continues | N073 |
| N3 | The NT consistently uses [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (entole) for what continues -- Jesus's commandments, the Father's commandments, commandments of God in Revelation -- and [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dogma) for what was abolished. This is an observable vocabulary distinction. | E363, E364, E350, E347, E031-E033 | Neutral | N074 |
| N4 | In all four Gospels, there is no recorded instance of Jesus explicitly revoking, abolishing, or declaring any of the Ten Commandments obsolete or no longer binding. Every recorded treatment of specific Decalogue commandments involves citation as path to life, heart-level deepening, defense as "commandment of God," or use of their violation (anomia) as eschatological disqualifier. | E342, E359, E361, E354, E355 | Continues | N075 |

### 3. Inferences Table (4-Type Taxonomy)

| # | Claim | Type | Position | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria | Master ID |
|---|-------|------|----------|-----|------|----------|---|
| I1 | The "new commandment" (Jhn 13:34) replaces the Decalogue, providing a new law-system (law of love/law of Christ) that renders the Ten Commandments obsolete. | I-D | Abolished | E346: kainos = quality, not time. E348: 1 Jhn 2:7 explicitly calls it "OLD commandment from the beginning." E349: 2 Jhn 1:5 explicitly denies neos-newness. N072: same entole vocabulary for Jesus's AND Father's commandments. E354-E355: anomia as eschatological disqualifier presupposes continuing law-standard. | Requires overriding E346 (kainos vs. neos), E348 (John's explicit "old from the beginning"), E349 (John's explicit denial of new-ness), and N072 (the authority chain using same vocabulary). No E or N item presents the "new commandment" as a replacement for the Decalogue. | #1 (adds concept "replacement" the text does not state), #4b (cross-references without verified connection between "new commandment" and Decalogue abolition) | I091 |
| I2 | Anomia (G458) in Mat 7:23; 13:41 refers to moral failure generally, not specifically to Decalogue transgression -- the word "lawlessness" does not necessarily imply the Mosaic moral law is the standard violated. | I-C | Abolished | E354: Mat 7:23 uses ten anomian (definite article = specific lawlessness). N073: 1 Jhn 3:4's bidirectional equation defines sin = anomia. The word's morpheme (a-nomos = without-nomos) structurally links to nomos. No alternative law-standard is identified in the text. | Compatible with the text but adds an external framework (generic/soft anomia) that the text's own vocabulary does not support. The text provides no alternative law-standard to the moral law. | #3 (applies external framework of generic moral failure to a term the text defines specifically) | I092 |
| I3 | "The law and the prophets were until John" (Luk 16:16) means the entire law ceased with John the Baptist, making the moral law no longer operative. | I-D | Abolished | Already registered as I080 (law-12). E022/Luk 16:17 (immediately following verse) says "one tittle of the law cannot fail." E021/Mat 5:17-18: "not one tittle shall pass." E025/Rom 3:31: "we establish the law." | Requires overriding the immediately next verse (Luk 16:17), which emphatically denies law-cessation, plus Mat 5:17-18 and Rom 3:31. Adds the concept "ceased" to a verse whose next sentence denies cessation. | #1 (adds "ceased"), #4b (imports termination concept not in the text) | I093 (= I080) |
| I4 | "My commandments" in Jhn 14:15 refers to new commandments Jesus gave in the NT era (love, humility, service) and is categorically distinct from and does not include the Decalogue. | I-D | Abolished | N072: same entole vocabulary for Jesus's commandments AND Father's commandments in Jhn 15:10. E361: Jesus calls 5th Decalogue commandment "the commandment of God" using identical entole vocabulary. E342: Jesus's answer to "which commandments?" IS the Decalogue. E351: Jesus places Himself under the Father's entole in Jhn 14:31. | Requires overriding N072 (Father's commandments = Jesus's commandments in same verse), E361 (Jesus calls Decalogue "commandment of God" with same word), E342 (the Decalogue IS "the commandments" in Jesus's usage), and E351 (Jesus under Father's commandment chain). | #1 (adds categorical distinction the text does not draw), #2 (chooses between possible meanings of entole when context identifies Decalogue) | I094 |

---

### I-B Resolution

No I-B inferences were generated in this study. All competing-evidence items in the law-14 scope (Luke 16:16 vs. 16:17; "new commandment" as replacement vs. deepening; "my commandments" as distinct vs. identical with Decalogue) resolve as I-D (counter-evidence external) because the texts claiming abolition require overriding explicit statements in the immediate context. None have E/N items on both sides of the specific question; the Abolished readings require importing concepts the text does not contain.

---

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases actual verse text.
- Each states what the text says, not what a position infers from it.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- All Continues E-items pass the four-gate validation (Tree 3):
  - Gate 1 (Referent): The commandments are identified by name (Decalogue commandments in Mat 19:18-19), by specific OT source (Deu 6:5, Lev 19:18), or by vocabulary (entole for moral commandments, dogma for abolished ordinances).
  - Gate 2 (Grammar): Greek grammar supports each classification. Anomia = a-nomos (without-law) structurally presupposes nomos. Kainos = quality-new, not time-new.
  - Gate 3 (Genre): All passages are didactic (direct teaching, epistles, law).
  - Gate 4 (Harmony): No E-item contradicts another E-item. All Continues items are consistent with each other and with prior studies.
- Neutral E-items are factual observations both sides accept (grammatical data, vocabulary facts, textual observations).

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- N072: Follows from the same entole vocabulary in Jhn 15:10 for both "my commandments" and "my Father's commandments" + structural parallelism. Universal agreement test: an Abolished scholar would agree that the same word is used and the structure is parallel. No interpretation required beyond what the words say.
- N073: Follows from articular predicate nominative grammar. A Greek grammarian of any theological position would agree that two articular nouns with copulative estin form a convertible proposition.
- N074: Follows from observable vocabulary data. Both sides can verify entole/dogma distribution.
- N075: Follows from the absence of any counter-instance in the Gospel text. Both sides can verify no Gospel passage records Jesus revoking a Decalogue commandment.

**Step C-E: Verify inference classifications.**
- I091 (I-D): Source test -- requires "replacement" concept not found in any E/N item. Direction test -- overrides E346, E348, E349.
- I092 (I-C): Source test -- "generic moral failure" is an external framework not derived from E/N. Direction test -- does not override E/N directly, but ignores the word-root data.
- I093 (I-D): Source test -- "ceased" is not found in E/N for this verse. Direction test -- overrides E022 (the next verse).
- I094 (I-D): Source test -- "categorically distinct" is not found in E/N. Direction test -- overrides N072, E361, E342.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- No SIS #4a connections claimed in this study. All cross-references are verified by shared vocabulary (entole) and tool-confirmed parallel scores.

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies)

1. Jesus directs the rich young ruler to the Decalogue commandments (5th-9th specifically named) as the path to "enter into life" (Mat 19:17-19; Mrk 10:19; Luk 18:20).
2. Jesus identifies the two love commandments (Deu 6:5 and Lev 19:18) as the organizational principle on which "all the law and the prophets" hang (Mat 22:37-40).
3. Jesus's "new commandment" uses kainos (G2537, new in quality), not neos (G3501, new in time); John explicitly identifies it as simultaneously "old from the beginning" and "new" (1 Jhn 2:7-8; 2 Jhn 1:5).
4. Jesus equates "my commandments" with "my Father's commandments" using the same word (entole, G1785) in the same verse (Jhn 15:10), establishing a single commandment-authority chain.
5. John defines sin as anomia (lawlessness, 1 Jhn 3:4) in a bidirectional convertible equation; Jesus rejects "workers of anomia" at the eschatological judgment (Mat 7:23; 13:41).
6. Jesus affirms BOTH the weightier matters (judgment, mercy, faith) AND the lighter matters (tithing) of the law as obligatory: "these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone" (Mat 23:23).
7. Jesus assigns the law permanence exceeding the cosmos: "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail" (Luk 16:17).
8. In all four Gospels, there is no recorded instance of Jesus revoking, abolishing, or declaring any of the Ten Commandments obsolete or no longer binding (N075).
9. Jesus explicitly calls a specific Decalogue commandment "the commandment of God" (entolen tou Theou) and defends it against human tradition (Mat 15:3-9; Mrk 7:8-13).
10. The NT consistently uses entole (G1785) for what continues and dogma (G1378) for what was abolished/nailed to the cross (N074).
11. The scribe's distinction between moral commands (love) and ceremonial obligations (offerings/sacrifices) is affirmed by Jesus: "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God" (Mrk 12:33-34).
12. The antitheses (Mat 5:21-48) deepen Decalogue commandments to heart-level application; no antithesis revokes a commandment.

## What CANNOT Be Said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture)

1. It cannot be said that Jesus taught any new commandment that replaced or rendered obsolete an existing moral commandment of the Decalogue. No Gospel text records such a statement.
2. It cannot be said that "the law and the prophets were until John" (Luk 16:16) means the moral law ended at John's ministry. The immediately following verse (16:17) states the law endures longer than the cosmos, and v.18 applies the 7th commandment.
3. It cannot be said that Jesus's "my commandments" refers to a categorically new set of commands distinct from the Decalogue. Jesus uses the same word (entole) for His commandments and the Father's commandments, equating them in the same verse (Jhn 15:10).
4. It cannot be said that the "new commandment" was new in content. John explicitly calls it "old from the beginning" (1 Jhn 2:7) and denies it is new in the replacement sense (2 Jhn 1:5). What is new (kainos) is the standard: "as I have loved you."
5. It cannot be said that anomia (lawlessness) in Jesus's usage refers to vague moral failure without a specific law in view. The word's morpheme (a-nomos) presupposes nomos; the definite article (ten anomian, Mat 7:23) specifies THE lawlessness; and John's definition (1 Jhn 3:4) makes the equation explicit.
6. It cannot be said that the greatest commandment (love God, love neighbor) replaces the Decalogue. The text says "on these two commandments HANG all the law" (Mat 22:40) -- the law depends on the love commands as its organizing principle, not the other way around.
7. It cannot be said that Jesus's defense of the 5th commandment (Corban controversy) or His citation of Decalogue commandments (Rich Young Ruler) is merely historical custom rather than normative teaching. Jesus presents these as "the commandment of God" (Mrk 7:8-9) and as "the commandments" for entering life (Mat 19:17).

---

## Conclusion

This study catalogs Jesus's specific teachings about the law and commandments across all eight investigation areas. The evidence is classified as follows:

24 explicit statements are identified in this study. 17 use law-continuation vocabulary applied to moral commandments (Continues). 7 are textual observations both sides accept (Neutral). 0 use law-cessation vocabulary applied to the moral law (Abolished).

4 necessary implications follow unavoidably from the explicit statements. 3 support the continuing-law position (the commandment-authority chain, the sin=anomia equation, the absence of any recorded Decalogue revocation). 1 is a neutral vocabulary observation (the entole/dogma distinction).

4 inferences are identified, all from the Abolished position. 1 is I-C (Compatible External: anomia as generic moral failure). 3 are I-D (Counter-Evidence External: "new commandment" as Decalogue replacement, "law until John" as moral law cessation, "my commandments" as distinct from Decalogue). Each I-D item requires overriding established E/N items.

No Abolished E-items or N-items were found in this study. Every Abolished claim is at the inference level and requires adding concepts the text does not contain or overriding what the text explicitly states.
