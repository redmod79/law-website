# Bible Study: Jesus's Specific Teachings on the Law and Commandments

## Question

What did Jesus specifically teach about the law and commandments across all four Gospels and John's epistles? This study focuses on eight specific investigation areas:

1. **Rich Young Ruler** (Mat 19:16-22, Mark 10:17-22, Luke 18:18-23) -- Jesus directs someone to the commandments as the path of life. Which commandments does He cite? Does He add to, subtract from, or affirm the Decalogue?
2. **Greatest Commandment** (Mat 22:36-40, Mark 12:28-34) -- Jesus identifies the greatest commandment(s). What is the relationship between "love God / love neighbor" and the Ten Commandments? Does Jesus replace the Decalogue with a simpler summary, or does He identify its organizing principle?
3. **"New commandment"** (John 13:34, 15:12) -- Jesus gives a "new commandment" to love one another. Is this new in content (replacing the old) or new in quality/depth (kainos, G2537)? How does this relate to Leviticus 19:18?
4. **"Keep my commandments"** (John 14:15, 15:10) -- Jesus says "if you love me, keep my commandments." What are "my commandments"? Are they a new set, or the same commandments He has been affirming? What does entole (G1785) refer to in John's usage?
5. **John's epistles on sin and law** (1 John 3:4, 2:3-4, 5:2-3) -- John defines sin as anomia (G458, lawlessness). Which law is the standard? How does John connect "keeping His commandments" to "knowing Him"?
6. **Jesus on lawlessness** (Mat 7:21-23) -- Jesus rejects workers of anomia (G458). What is the law they violated? How does this connect to John's definition of sin?
7. **Weightier matters of the law** (Mat 23:23) -- Jesus identifies judgment, mercy, and faith as "weightier matters of the law." Does this presuppose a continuing moral law? What does "these ought ye to have done" indicate?
8. **Luke 16:17** -- "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail." What is the scope and duration Jesus assigns to the law?

### Key Findings from Prior Studies

**law-01 (God's Moral Law):** Established seven unique markers distinguishing the Decalogue from all other laws: spoken by God directly, written by God's finger, written on stone, placed inside the Ark, called "the covenant," prefaced with "I am the LORD thy God," and consisting of ten words. Three independent channels attest the moral law: nature, conscience, direct revelation. 66 E-items, 7 N-items, 10 I-items.

**law-02 (Pre-Sinai Moral Law):** Moral law preceded Sinai -- Gen 26:5 uses torah, mitsvah, chuqqah, mishmereth for Abraham's obedience. Rom 5:12-14 requires law before Sinai for sin to exist.

**law-03 (Exodus Narrative):** Five dimensions distinguish the Decalogue from subsequent legislation in the Exodus narrative itself: speaker, medium, repository, audience reaction, and structural position.

**law-04 (Ceremonial Laws):** Ceremonial laws differ from moral law in vocabulary (dogma vs. entole), purpose (typological vs. moral), duration markers, and NT treatment. Colossians 2:14 targets dogma (ordinances), not entole (commandments).

**law-05 (Civil/Judicial Laws):** Civil laws function as case-law applications of Decalogue principles, not as independent moral legislation.

**law-06 (Hebrew Law Vocabulary):** Six distinct Hebrew terms for law (torah, mitsvah, choq, mishpat, edut, piqqud) are not interchangeable; they designate different categories of divine instruction.

**law-07 (Law of Moses):** "Law of Moses" refers to comprehensive Pentateuchal legislation; context determines which category is in view.

**law-08 (What Was Abolished at the Cross):** The NT uses dogma/cheirographon for what was nailed to the cross, never nomos/entole. The abolished items are the ceremonial handwriting of ordinances, not the moral commandments.

**law-09 (Old Covenant):** The old covenant was an arrangement/administration that changed, not the law content. The law itself was written on hearts under the new covenant.

**law-10 (New Covenant and Law):** The new covenant writes "MY law" (torati/nomous mou) on hearts -- same law, different location. Jeremiah 31:33 and Hebrews 8:10 use possessive "my law," identifying continuity. 46 E-items (26 Continues, 0 Abolished).

**law-11 (Written on Hearts):** The berith-Decalogue equation: "my law" = the Decalogue specifically, based on the covenant-law identity established in Deuteronomy and carried through Jeremiah to Hebrews.

**law-12 (Matthew 5:17-20):** Kataluo (G2647) means demolish/annul in all 17 NT uses. Pleroo (G4137) means fill full with meaning. Jesus's programmatic statement excludes abrogation of the law. The antitheses (Mat 5:21-48) deepen the commandments rather than replacing them. 21 E-items (14 Continues, 0 Abolished).

**law-13 (Jesus and the Sabbath):** Every Sabbath controversy uses exesti ("is it lawful?") framework -- Jesus corrects misapplication, never questions Sabbath validity. Post-crucifixion evidence: Luke 23:56 "according to the commandment"; Mat 24:20 prayer instruction for future flight. 22 E-items (11 Continues, 0 Abolished).

**jesus-commandments-nt-vs-ot (Related Study):** Complete catalog showing Jesus affirmed ALL TEN commandments across the Gospels. "New commandment" uses kainos (G2537, new in quality), and its content matches Lev 19:18. Sermon on the Mount commands all trace to OT roots.

**greatest-commandment-shema (Related Study):** Jesus quoted Deu 6:4-5 (Shema) as greatest commandment. Added "mind" (dianoia) making explicit what was implicit in Hebrew levav. Deu 5 (Ten Commandments) sets up Deu 6 (how to internalize them) -- the Greatest Commandment is the summary principle of the Decalogue, not its replacement.

### Focus Areas

Derived from tool discoveries, these are the specific focus areas for research:

1. **Entole (G1785) in Jesus's mouth and John's writings** -- Track every use of entole attributed to Jesus or discussed by John. From search_strongs.py: 43 occurrences. The research agent should retrieve all Gospel and Johannine epistle occurrences to determine what Jesus means by "my commandments."

2. **Anomia (G458) as Jesus's and John's standard** -- 13 occurrences. Mat 7:23 uses anomia for those Jesus rejects. 1 John 3:4 defines sin as anomia. The research agent should retrieve all 13 occurrences and determine what "law" is presupposed by "lawlessness."

3. **Kainos (G2537) vs. neos in "new commandment"** -- 39 occurrences of kainos. The research agent should examine John 13:34 and 15:12 in light of how kainos is used elsewhere (new covenant, new creation, new name) to determine whether "new" means replacement or qualitative renewal.

4. **The Rich Young Ruler synoptic comparison** -- Three parallel accounts (Mat 19, Mark 10, Luke 18). The research agent should retrieve all three, compare which commandments Jesus cites, and note what Jesus adds or omits relative to the Decalogue.

5. **Greatest Commandment and Decalogue structure** -- Mat 22:36-40 and Mark 12:28-34. The research agent should investigate whether "on these two commandments hang all the law" means the two replace the ten or summarize/organize the ten. Cross-reference with the greatest-commandment-shema study.

6. **Weightier matters of the law** -- Mat 23:23. Jesus says the Pharisees should tithe AND do the weightier matters. The research agent should examine the phrase "these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone" as evidence of Jesus presupposing the law's ongoing validity.

7. **Luke 16:17 and law permanence** -- Retrieve Luke 16:16-17 in full context. Examine the scope claim ("easier for heaven and earth to pass") alongside Mat 5:18 (studied in law-12) for Jesus's explicit statements on law duration.

8. **Nave's COMMANDMENTS "Precepts of Jesus" section** -- The research agent should retrieve the full list of Jesus's precepts cataloged by Nave's and identify which ones trace to Decalogue commandments vs. which are new moral instruction.
