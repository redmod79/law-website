# Verse Analysis

## Question
What did Jesus specifically teach about the law and commandments? Catalogue every instance: rich young ruler, greatest commandment, new commandment, keep my commandments, 1 John's reflections, anomia/lawlessness, weightier matters, law permanence. Did Jesus ever abolish any moral commandment?

INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by those who say the law continues, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by those who say the law is abolished, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says.
- When presenting findings, state: "The text says X" (explicit). Then state: "From this, Y interpretation infers Z" and "W interpretation infers V" (inferred).
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### 1. Rich Young Ruler (Mat 19:16-22; Mrk 10:17-22; Luk 18:18-23)

**Context:** A man approaches Jesus asking what he must do to have eternal life. All three synoptic accounts record the exchange. Matthew identifies him as young (v.20, 22); Luke identifies him as a ruler (archon, v.18).

**Direct statement:** Jesus answers: "if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments" (Mat 19:17). When asked "which?" Jesus names five specific Decalogue commandments:

| Commandment | Matthew 19 | Mark 10 | Luke 18 |
|-------------|-----------|---------|---------|
| 6th: Do not kill | v.18 | v.19 | v.20 |
| 7th: Do not commit adultery | v.18 | v.19 | v.20 |
| 8th: Do not steal | v.18 | v.19 | v.20 |
| 9th: Do not bear false witness | v.18 | v.19 | v.20 |
| 5th: Honour father and mother | v.19 | v.19 | v.20 |
| Additional: Love thy neighbour (Lev 19:18) | v.19 (Matthew only) | — | — |
| Additional: Defraud not | — | v.19 (Mark only) | — |

**Key observations:**
1. Jesus uses entole (G1785) -- the standard word for "commandment" -- for what He tells the man to keep.
2. The commandments Jesus names are all from the second table of the Decalogue (human relationships, commandments 5-9). He does not cite commandments 1-4 (God-ward duties) directly, though Matthew adds Lev 19:18 ("love thy neighbour as thyself"), which is the summary of the second table.
3. Mark adds "Defraud not" (me apostereses), which may correspond to the 10th commandment (covetousness) or to Lev 19:13.
4. The man's claim to have kept these "from my youth" is not contradicted by Jesus. Jesus then adds: "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell..." (Mat 19:21). The word "perfect" (teleios, G5046) indicates an additional step beyond the commandment-keeping -- not a replacement for it.
5. All three synoptic accounts present the Decalogue as the content Jesus identifies when asked about the path to eternal life. This is structurally parallel to Luke 10:28 ("this do, and thou shalt live").

**Cross-references:**
- Exo 20:12-16 (the five commandments cited, in Decalogue order)
- Lev 19:18 (the neighbor-love command Matthew adds)
- Mat 5:17-19 (Jesus' programmatic statement: not come to destroy the law; studied in law-12)
- The parallels tool confirms the OT roots: Exo 16:28 (score 0.349), Deu 5:29 (score 0.336), Pro 4:4 (score 0.334), Deu 30:16 (score 0.329) -- all passages linking commandment-keeping to life.

---

### 2. Greatest Commandment (Mat 22:34-40; Mrk 12:28-34; Luk 10:25-28)

**Context:** A lawyer/scribe asks Jesus which commandment is the greatest in the law. In Luke's account, the question is "what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"

**Direct statement:** Jesus quotes two OT passages:
1. Deuteronomy 6:5 (the Shema): "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind" -- identified as "the first and great commandment" (Mat 22:38).
2. Leviticus 19:18: "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" -- identified as "the second" that is "like unto it" (Mat 22:39).

Jesus then states: "On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets" (Mat 22:40).

**Key observations:**
1. The verb "hang" (kremannumi, G2910) means "suspend from" -- as curtains hang on a rod. The two love commandments are the structural supports from which the law hangs. This is an organizational statement, not a replacement statement. The law hangs ON these commandments; it does not disappear INTO them.
2. The Continues interpretation infers that the two love commandments are the organizing principle of the Ten Commandments: commandments 1-4 (love God) and commandments 5-10 (love neighbor). *(Examined in depth in greatest-commandment-shema.)*
3. The Abolished interpretation infers that Jesus replaces the Decalogue with two simpler commands.
4. Mark 12:33-34 adds a significant detail: the scribe responds that love to God and neighbor is "more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices." Jesus affirms: "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God." The scribe explicitly distinguishes moral commands (love) from ceremonial obligations (offerings/sacrifices), and Jesus endorses this distinction.
5. In Luke 10:28, Jesus confirms: "this do, and thou shalt live." The two love commands are presented as the path to life -- structurally identical to Mat 19:17 ("keep the commandments...enter into life").
6. Jesus quotes existing OT commandments (Deu 6:5 and Lev 19:18), not new commands. Both pre-date Jesus' earthly ministry.

**Cross-references:**
- Deu 6:4-5 (the Shema -- the immediate context of the greatest commandment is Deu 5, the Decalogue; studied in greatest-commandment-shema)
- Lev 19:17-18 (the love-of-neighbor command in its context of moral obligation)
- Rom 13:8-10 (Paul uses the same two love commands to summarize the law, then lists five Decalogue commandments as the content love fulfills)
- Gal 5:14 (Paul: "all the law is fulfilled in one word...love thy neighbour")

---

### 3. New Commandment (Jhn 13:34-35; 15:12-17)

**Context:** The Upper Room Discourse, the night before Jesus' crucifixion. Judas has just departed.

**Direct statement:** "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another" (Jhn 13:34).

**Key observations:**
1. **The word "new" is kainos (G2537), not neos (G3501).** Kainos denotes newness in quality, character, or freshness. Neos denotes newness in time (recently originated). The same word kainos is used for: the new covenant (Jer 31:31 LXX; Heb 8:8,13), new creation (2 Cor 5:17), new heaven and earth (Rev 21:1). In each case, kainos indicates qualitative transformation of something that already existed, not creation of something that never existed before.
2. **The command itself (love one another) is not new in content.** Leviticus 19:18 states "thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." The content is pre-existing.
3. **What is new (kainos) is the STANDARD:** "as I have loved you" (kathos egapesa humas). The aorist tense (egapesa) of agapao points to Christ's completed self-sacrificial love. The standard of love is elevated from the OT "as thyself" to the NT "as I have loved you" -- Christ's self-giving example.
4. **John himself clarifies the old/new relationship.** In 1 Jhn 2:7-8, he writes: "I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning...Again, a new commandment I write unto you." The same commandment is simultaneously old (in content) and new (in quality/depth). In 2 Jhn 1:5, he writes: "not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another."
5. **The vocabulary is entole (G1785)** -- the same word used for the Decalogue commandments (Mat 19:17), Jesus' "my commandments" (Jhn 14:15), the Father's commandments (Jhn 15:10), and the "commandments of God" in Revelation (12:17; 14:12; 22:14). The word family is consistent throughout.

**Cross-references:**
- Lev 19:18 (the original neighbor-love command)
- Parallels tool: Jhn 13:34 to Jhn 15:12 (score 0.571), 2 Jhn 1:5 (score 0.527), Jhn 14:21 (score 0.470), Mrk 12:31 (score 0.448) -- all love-commandment connections
- Parallels tool OT: Exo 20:6 (score 0.360), Deu 5:10 (score 0.360) -- the second commandment preamble links love and commandment-keeping

---

### 4. Keep My Commandments (Jhn 14:15, 21, 23-24, 31; 15:10)

**Context:** Continuation of the Upper Room Discourse.

**Direct statements:**
- "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (Jhn 14:15)
- "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me" (Jhn 14:21)
- "If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him" (Jhn 14:23)
- "The word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me" (Jhn 14:24)
- "As the Father gave me commandment, even so I do" (Jhn 14:31)
- "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love" (Jhn 15:10)

**Key observations:**
1. **The love-obedience link:** Jesus repeatedly connects love for Him with keeping His commandments. The structure is: love -> obedience, obedience -> evidence of love. This is the same structure as Exo 20:6 / Deu 5:10: "shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments." The parallels tool confirms: John 14:15's highest OT parallels are Neh 1:5 (0.406), Exo 20:6 (0.403), Deu 5:10 (0.403) -- all passages combining love and commandment-keeping.
2. **"My commandments" = "my Father's commandments."** John 15:10 makes the equation explicit: "If ye keep MY commandments...even as I have kept MY FATHER'S commandments." Jesus uses the same word (entolas) for both and presents His own keeping of the Father's commandments as the structural model for disciples. The word which the disciples hear is "not mine, but the Father's which sent me" (14:24).
3. **The authority chain:** Father's commandments -> Jesus keeps them -> Jesus gives them to disciples -> disciples keep them. This is a transmission chain, not a replacement chain. Jesus does not create new commandments independent of the Father's; He transmits and exemplifies the Father's.
4. **John 14:31:** Jesus says "as the Father gave me commandment (entolen), even so I do." Jesus presents Himself as under the Father's entole (G1785) and as obeying it. This parallels Mat 5:17 (He came not to destroy the law) and Mat 19:17 (keep the commandments).

**Cross-references:**
- Exo 20:6 / Deu 5:10 (the Decalogue preamble: love + commandments)
- 1 Jhn 5:3 ("this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments")
- Jhn 12:50 ("I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak")

### 5. John's Epistles on Sin and Law (1 Jhn 2:3-7; 3:4-8; 3:22-24; 4:21; 5:2-3; 2 Jhn 1:4-6)

**Context:** John's epistles, written to Christian communities, reflecting on the implications of Jesus' teaching.

**Direct statements:**
- "Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments" (1 Jhn 2:3)
- "He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar" (1 Jhn 2:4)
- "I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning" (1 Jhn 2:7)
- "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law" (1 Jhn 3:4)
- "This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous" (1 Jhn 5:3)
- "And this is love, that we walk after his commandments" (2 Jhn 1:6)

**Key observations:**
1. **1 John 3:4 -- the definitional equation.** The Greek is: he hamartia estin he anomia. Both nouns carry the definite article with a copulative estin ("is"). When both subject and predicate nominative are articular with a copulative verb, the equation is bidirectional (convertible proposition): sin IS lawlessness, and lawlessness IS sin. The word anomia (G458) is structurally a-nomos: "without-law" or "against-law." Sin is defined as violation of law.
2. **Which law?** John does not specify "which law" in 3:4, but several contextual indicators point to the moral law: (a) anomia's root is nomos, the standard word for the moral law; (b) John's context (3:7-12) includes references to righteousness, Cain's murder, and love of brethren -- moral categories; (c) John elsewhere identifies the commandments as "his commandments" using entole (G1785), the same word used for the Decalogue; (d) John calls them "an old commandment...from the beginning" (2:7), pointing to pre-existing moral content.
3. **1 John 2:7-8 -- old and new simultaneously.** John writes "no new commandment" (v.7) and then "a new commandment" (v.8). This mirrors the kainos analysis of John 13:34: the content is old (from the beginning); the quality is new. The "old commandment from the beginning" could refer to the creation-era moral order or to the Sinai commandments; both are pre-Johannine.
4. **Commandment-keeping as test of genuine faith.** 1 Jhn 2:3-4 makes commandment-keeping the verification of knowing God: keeping them = evidence of knowing Him; not keeping them + claiming to know Him = being a liar. 1 Jhn 3:22-24 connects commandment-keeping to answered prayer (v.22) and to mutual indwelling with God (v.24).
5. **2 John 1:5-6 explicitly states the love commandment is "not a new commandment" but "that which we had from the beginning."** This is John's own commentary denying that the love commandment is a newly created replacement for the OT commandments.

---

### 6. Jesus on Lawlessness / Anomia (Mat 7:21-23; 13:41; 23:28; 24:12)

**Context:** Four separate passages where Jesus uses anomia (G458, lawlessness/iniquity).

**Matthew 7:21-23 (Sermon on the Mount conclusion):**
**Direct statement:** "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven...I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity (anomian)."

**Key observations:**
1. The Greek phrase is hoi ergazomenoi ten anomian -- "the ones working THE lawlessness." The definite article (ten) before anomian points to a specific, recognized lawlessness, not vague wickedness.
2. The present participle (ergazomenoi) indicates ongoing, habitual practice.
3. Those rejected are performing religious works (prophesying, casting out devils, doing mighty works) in Jesus' name. Their rejection is not for lack of religious activity but for practicing anomia -- lawlessness.
4. This passage occurs at the end of the Sermon on the Mount. The same sermon includes Mat 5:17-19 (the law is not destroyed), Mat 7:12 (the Golden Rule IS "the law and the prophets"). The law whose violation constitutes anomia is contextually the law Jesus has been expounding throughout the sermon.
5. "The will of my Father" (v.21) is contrasted with anomia (v.23). Doing the Father's will = keeping the law; anomia = violating it.

**Matthew 13:41-42 (Parable of the Tares):**
**Direct statement:** "The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity (anomian)."

**Key observation:** Anomia is the operative exclusionary characteristic at the final harvest. Those who practice anomia are gathered OUT of the kingdom. This eschatological use presupposes a continuing law-standard against which lawlessness is measured.

**Matthew 23:28 (Woe to the Pharisees):**
**Direct statement:** "Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity (anomias)."

**Key observation:** The Pharisees, the most externally law-observant class in Israel, are called "full of anomia" within. This demonstrates that anomia is an inner heart condition, consistent with Jesus' teaching in the antitheses (Mat 5:21-28) that the law extends to thoughts, motives, and desires.

**Matthew 24:12 (Olivet Discourse):**
**Direct statement:** "And because iniquity (anomia) shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold."

**Key observation:** The causal connector hoti ("because") establishes that abounding anomia CAUSES love (agape) to cool. This inverts the relationship: lawlessness does not produce love; it destroys it. This is consistent with John's teaching that love = commandment-keeping (1 Jhn 5:3) and that sin = lawlessness (1 Jhn 3:4). Where law is violated, love fails.

**Cross-references:**
- 1 Jhn 3:4 (anomia as the definition of sin -- same word, same author's theological community)
- 2 Thes 2:3, 7 (the "man of sin," the "mystery of iniquity" -- anomia in eschatological context)
- Tit 2:14 (Christ redeems FROM anomia -- the purpose is rescue from lawlessness, not permission for it)
- Heb 1:9 ("loved righteousness, hated anomia" -- applied to Christ)

---

### 7. Weightier Matters of the Law (Mat 23:23-24; cf. Luk 11:42)

**Context:** Jesus addresses scribes and Pharisees in the "Woe" pronouncements of Matthew 23.

**Direct statement:** "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone" (Mat 23:23).

**Key observations:**
1. **"The weightier matters of the law" (ta barutera tou nomou).** The comparative adjective barutera ("weightier/heavier") implies the law has matters of differing weight. The law is not flat -- some matters are more fundamental than others. The three named are: krisis (judgment/justice), eleos (mercy), and pistis (faith/faithfulness). These are moral qualities, not ritual observances.
2. **"These ought ye to have done" (tauta de edei poiesai).** The imperfect of dei (edei, "it was necessary") with the aorist infinitive creates an obligation statement: the weightier matters ARE obligatory.
3. **"And not to leave the other undone" (kakeina me apheinai).** The "other" (kakeina) refers to the tithing of herbs. Jesus does not abolish the lesser observance; He says BOTH the weightier and the lesser should be done. Neither is cancelled.
4. **The passage presupposes the law's ongoing validity.** Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for improper prioritization (majoring in minors), not for keeping the law. He affirms the law's requirements at both levels -- weightier and lighter.
5. **The parallel to Micah 6:8:** "What doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly (mishpat), and to love mercy (chesed), and to walk humbly with thy God?" The same three categories appear: justice, mercy, and faithful humility before God. Jesus echoes the prophetic tradition that moral substance is more fundamental than ritual detail -- but both are affirmed.
6. **Matthew 23:2-3 (context):** Jesus says "The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do." Even while rebuking the Pharisees' hypocrisy, Jesus directs the people to observe what they teach from Moses' seat -- the law.

---

### 8. Law Permanence (Luk 16:16-17; Mat 5:17-19; Mat 24:35)

**Luke 16:16-17:**
**Direct statement:** "The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail" (Luk 16:16-17).

**Key observations:**
1. Verse 16 appears to set a temporal limit: "the law and the prophets were until John." The Abolished interpretation infers the law ended with John the Baptist.
2. Verse 17 immediately follows with a permanence statement: "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail." This ties the law's endurance to the existence of the cosmos itself.
3. The juxtaposition of v.16 and v.17 indicates v.16 addresses the PROPHETIC ERA (the dispensation of "the law and the prophets" as the primary mode of God's communication), while v.17 addresses the LAW'S CONTENT (which does not fail). The kingdom of God is now preached (v.16), but the law's content endures (v.17).
4. Luke 16:18 immediately applies a specific law: "Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery." This is a direct application of the 7th commandment -- demonstrating that Jesus applies the moral law in the same breath that He discusses its permanence.
5. Luke 16:29-31 (the Rich Man and Lazarus parable): Abraham says "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them." Even in the age of the kingdom, Moses and the prophets remain the authoritative source.

**Matthew 5:17-19** *(Examined in depth in law-12-matthew-5-17-20.)*
Jesus states: "Think not that I am come to destroy the law...Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law...Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven."

**Matthew 24:35:**
"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away." Jesus assigns His own words cosmic permanence, consistent with the permanence He assigns to the law in Mat 5:18.

---

### 9. Corban / Commandments of God vs. Traditions of Men (Mrk 7:6-13; Mat 15:3-9)

**Context:** The Pharisees challenge Jesus about His disciples not washing hands. Jesus responds with a countercharge.

**Direct statement:** Jesus says: "Full well ye reject the commandment of God (entolen tou Theou), that ye may keep your own tradition" (Mrk 7:9). He then identifies the specific commandment: "Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother" (Mrk 7:10) -- the 5th Decalogue commandment.

**Key observations:**
1. Jesus explicitly calls the 5th commandment "the commandment of GOD" (entolen tou Theou) -- not "the commandment of Moses." The Decalogue is identified as God's commandment.
2. Jesus defends the Decalogue AGAINST the Pharisees' tradition. The Corban tradition allowed someone to dedicate money to the temple (as a "gift") to avoid the obligation of supporting aging parents. Jesus denounces this as making "the word of God of none effect through your tradition" (Mrk 7:13).
3. Jesus distinguishes between "the commandment of God" and "the commandments of men" (Mrk 7:7-8). The "commandments of men" are the traditions the Pharisees enforce. The "commandment of God" is the Decalogue command Jesus defends. This is itself a distinction between two types of authority within what the Pharisees treated as a unified system.
4. The passage demonstrates Jesus treating a specific Decalogue commandment as binding, authoritative, and in force -- and defending it against misuse by human traditions.

---

### 10. The Antitheses (Mat 5:21-48)

*(Examined in depth in law-12-matthew-5-17-20.)*

**Direct statements:** Jesus quotes commandments using the formula "Ye have heard that it was said..." and then deepens each with "But I say unto you..."

**Key observations:**
1. Antitheses 1-2 explicitly quote the 6th and 7th Decalogue commandments and extend them to heart-level: anger (not just murder), lust (not just adultery). The direction is GREATER stringency, not relaxation.
2. Antithesis 6 corrects "Thou shalt love thy neighbour, AND HATE THINE ENEMY." The phrase "hate thine enemy" is not found in the OT. Jesus corrects a human tradition appended to the biblical commandment (Lev 19:18), distinguishing the commandment from the tradition -- the same pattern as the Corban controversy.
3. Mark 7:20-23 lists moral evils that defile: "evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness." These map to Decalogue categories (adultery = 7th; murder = 6th; theft = 8th; covetousness = 10th; blasphemy = 3rd). Jesus identifies these as the heart-level violations the Decalogue addresses.

---

### 11. The Golden Rule (Mat 7:12)

**Direct statement:** "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets."

**Key observations:**
1. Jesus identifies the Golden Rule as "the law and the prophets" -- the same phrase used in Mat 5:17 ("I am not come to destroy the law or the prophets") and Mat 22:40 ("On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets").
2. The Golden Rule is a positive restatement of the neighbor-love principle (Lev 19:18). It summarizes the second table of the Decalogue.
3. Jesus treats the law and the prophets as a unified, continuing body of authority that the Golden Rule captures.

---

### 12. John 12:50 -- The Father's Commandment Is Everlasting Life

**Direct statement:** "I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak."

**Key observation:** Jesus equates the Father's entole with "life everlasting." This parallels Mat 19:17 ("if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments") and Luk 10:28 ("this do, and thou shalt live"). The Father's commandment is consistently linked to life -- not a temporary requirement but an eternal standard.

---

### 13. Revelation Passages on Commandment-Keeping (Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14)

**Direct statements:**
- Rev 12:17: God's end-time people "keep the commandments of God (tas entolas tou Theou), and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."
- Rev 14:12: "Here are they that keep the commandments of God (tas entolas tou Theou), and the faith of Jesus."
- Rev 22:14: "Blessed are they that do his commandments (tas entolas autou), that they may have right to the tree of life."

**Key observations:**
1. All three passages use entole (G1785), the same word used throughout for the Decalogue and Jesus' commandments.
2. "The commandments of God" are paired with "the faith of Jesus" (14:12) and "the testimony of Jesus Christ" (12:17), demonstrating that commandment-keeping and faith/testimony are not opposed but complementary.
3. Rev 22:14 links commandment-keeping to access to the tree of life, echoing Mat 19:17 (commandments -> life) and Jhn 12:50 (commandment = life everlasting).
4. These are eschatological passages describing end-time saints. If the moral commandments were abolished at the cross, these passages (written post-cross) would identify non-existent obligations as the defining characteristic of God's people.

---

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Consistent Use of Entole (G1785) Across All Contexts
The same Greek word entole is used for:
- The Decalogue commandments Jesus cites to the rich young ruler (Mat 19:17)
- The greatest commandment (Mat 22:36, 38)
- The "commandment of God" Jesus defends in the Corban controversy (Mrk 7:8-9)
- Jesus' "my commandments" in the Upper Room (Jhn 14:15; 15:10)
- The "new commandment" (Jhn 13:34)
- The Father's commandment Jesus keeps (Jhn 14:31; 15:10)
- John's "his commandments" (1 Jhn 2:3; 3:22; 5:3)
- The "commandments of God" kept by end-time saints (Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14)

This vocabulary consistency creates a single commandment-authority thread from the Decalogue through Jesus' teaching to the end-time identification of God's people.

### Pattern 2: Anomia as the Opposite of Law-Keeping
Jesus uses anomia (G458) in four passages (Mat 7:23; 13:41; 23:28; 24:12). John defines sin as anomia (1 Jhn 3:4). The word's morpheme (a-nomos = without-nomos) presupposes a nomos that is being violated. Both Jesus and John treat law-violation (anomia) as the definitive characteristic of those excluded from God's kingdom, and commandment-keeping as the definitive characteristic of those included.

### Pattern 3: No Recorded Instance of Jesus Abolishing a Moral Commandment
Across all four Gospels, Jesus' treatment of specific commandments is consistently: citation as path to life (Rich Young Ruler), deepening to heart-level (antitheses), defense as "commandment of God" (Corban), affirmation as "weightier matters" (Mat 23:23), and use of their violation (anomia) as eschatological disqualifier. No passage records Jesus saying "this moral commandment is no longer binding" or "this Decalogue command is abolished."

### Pattern 4: The Kainos / Old-From-the-Beginning Dynamic
The "new commandment" is simultaneously old in content and new in quality. John explicitly clarifies this (1 Jhn 2:7-8; 2 Jhn 1:5). The "new" element is the standard ("as I have loved you"), not the content ("love one another"). This pattern matches the broader new covenant dynamic: the law is the same; the location (heart), power (Spirit), and standard (Christ's example) are elevated.

### Pattern 5: Love Defined as Commandment-Keeping, Not Its Replacement
1 Jhn 5:3: "This IS the love of God, that we keep his commandments." Rom 13:8-10: love fulfills the law by keeping the specific Decalogue commands. Mat 22:40: the law hangs on the love commands. The relationship is: love is the motive and energy for commandment-keeping; the commandments define what love does in practice. Love without commandments is undefined; commandments without love are dead. Neither replaces the other.

## Connections Between Passages

### The Authority Chain: Father -> Jesus -> Disciples -> End-Time Saints
- The Father's commandments (Jhn 14:31; 15:10) are what Jesus keeps.
- Jesus transmits these as "my commandments" (Jhn 14:15; 15:10).
- Disciples keep them (1 Jhn 2:3-4; 5:3; 2 Jhn 1:6).
- End-time saints are identified by keeping "the commandments of God" (Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14).
- The vocabulary is entole (G1785) throughout.
- The abolished item is dogma (G1378) -- ordinances (Col 2:14; Eph 2:15) -- a different word, different referent.

### The Life Connection: Commandments -> Life
- Mat 19:17: "if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments"
- Luk 10:28: "this do, and thou shalt live"
- Jhn 12:50: "his commandment is life everlasting"
- Rev 22:14: "do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life"
- This chain spans Synoptics, John's Gospel, and Revelation.

### The Anomia-Agape Inverse
- Where anomia (lawlessness) increases, agape (love) decreases (Mat 24:12).
- Where agape is present, law is fulfilled (Rom 13:8-10).
- Sin (hamartia) = anomia (1 Jhn 3:4); love = commandment-keeping (1 Jhn 5:3).
- The inverse relationship: more law-violation = less love; more love = more law-fulfillment.

## Word Study Insights

### Entole (G1785) vs. Dogma (G1378)
The NT maintains a vocabulary distinction between what continues and what was abolished:
- Entole (G1785, commandment) is used for what continues: Jesus' commandments, the Father's commandments, the commandments of God in Revelation.
- Dogma (G1378, ordinance/decree) is used for what was abolished/nailed to the cross: Col 2:14, Eph 2:15, Col 2:20.
- The two words never overlap in referent: entole never designates what was abolished; dogma never designates the moral commandments that continue.

### Kainos (G2537) vs. Neos (G3501)
The "new commandment" uses kainos (quality-new), not neos (time-new). This is consistent with its use for the new covenant, new creation, and new heaven/earth -- all cases of qualitative transformation, not origination of something previously non-existent. The new commandment is the old commandment elevated to a new standard.

### Anomia (G458) -- The Definition of Sin
The word anomia structurally means "without-law." The a- prefix negates nomos. The word presupposes a nomos (law) that is the standard against which lawlessness is measured. Jesus uses anomia as the eschatological disqualifier (Mat 7:23; 13:41); John uses it as the definition of sin (1 Jhn 3:4). Both presuppose a continuing law.

## Difficult Passages

### Luke 16:16 -- "The Law and the Prophets Were Until John"
This verse appears to set a temporal boundary at John's ministry. However, the immediately following verse (16:17) states "it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail." And v.18 immediately applies the 7th commandment (adultery in divorce). The verse-sequence indicates that v.16 addresses the prophetic dispensation (the era of "the law and the prophets" as the primary revelatory mode), not the content of the moral law. *(Cross-reference: I080/I093 in master evidence file -- classified I-D, requires overriding Luk 16:17 and Mat 5:17-18.)*

### Matthew 22:40 -- Does "Hang" Mean "Replace"?
The text says "on these two commandments HANG all the law and the prophets." The Abolished reading infers that since everything hangs on love, only love remains. The Continues reading notes that "hang on" (kremannumi) means "depend upon" or "are suspended from" -- the law depends on love as its organizing principle. Both inferences go beyond the text's direct statement. *(Cross-reference: This item is classified Neutral in the master evidence file as E042.)*

### John 14:15 -- Are "My Commandments" New Commands?
The Abolished reading infers that "my commandments" refers to new commandments Jesus gave in the NT era (love, humility, service) categorically distinct from the Decalogue. The text does not state this distinction. John 15:10 equates "my commandments" with "my Father's commandments" in the same verse. John 14:24 says "the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me." The contextual evidence identifies "my commandments" as the Father's commandments transmitted through Jesus. *(Cross-reference: I094 in master evidence file -- classified I-D, requires overriding N072, E361, E342, E351.)*
