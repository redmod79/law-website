---

## 1. Rich Young Ruler (Mat 19:16-22, Mark 10:17-22, Luke 18:18-23)

### Matthew 19:16-22
> **16** And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
> **17** And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? [there is] none good but one, [that is], God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
> **18** He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
> **19** Honour thy father and [thy] mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
> **20** The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?
> **21** Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go [and] sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come [and] follow me.
> **22** But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.

**Context (Mat 19:23-26):**
> **23** Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
> **24** And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
> **25** When his disciples heard [it], they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
> **26** But Jesus beheld [them], and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.

### Mark 10:17-22
> **17** And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
> **18** And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? [there is] none good but one, [that is], God.
> **19** Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.
> **20** And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.
> **21** Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
> **22** And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.

### Luke 18:18-23
> **18** And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
> **19** And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none [is] good, save one, [that is], God.
> **20** Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.
> **21** And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
> **22** Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
> **23** And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.

**Synoptic Comparison Notes:**
- Matthew: Jesus says "keep the commandments" and lists: no murder, no adultery, no stealing, no false witness, honor parents, love neighbor. Adds "love thy neighbour as thyself" (Lev 19:18).
- Mark: Jesus says "Thou knowest the commandments" and lists: no adultery, no killing, no stealing, no false witness, "Defraud not," honor parents. Adds "Defraud not" (not in Decalogue directly; relates to Exo 20:17 covetousness or Lev 19:13).
- Luke: Jesus says "Thou knowest the commandments" and lists: no adultery, no killing, no stealing, no false witness, honor parents.
- All three: Jesus directs the inquirer to the commandments (entole, G1785) as the path to life. He cites commandments 5-9 of the Decalogue. None cite the first four (God-ward) commandments directly, though Matthew adds the Lev 19:18 summary.

## 2. Greatest Commandment (Mat 22:34-40, Mark 12:28-34, Luke 10:25-28)

### Matthew 22:34-40

> **37** Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
> **38** This is the first and great commandment.
> **39** And the second [is] like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

> **30** And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this [is] the first commandment.
> **31** And the second [is] like, [namely] this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.
> **32** And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:
> **33** And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love [his] neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
> **34** And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him [any question].

### Luke 10:25-28
> **25** And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
> **26** He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?
> **27** And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.
> **28** And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.

**OT Source -- Deuteronomy 6:4-5 (Shema):**
> **4** Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God [is] one LORD:
> **5** And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

**OT Source -- Leviticus 19:18:**
> **18** Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I [am] the LORD.

**Context -- Leviticus 19:17:**
> **17** Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

## 3. New Commandment (John 13:34-35, John 15:12-17)

### John 13:34-35
> **34** A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
> **35** By this shall all [men] know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.

**Context (John 13:31-33):**
> **31** Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
> **32** If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.
> **33** Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.

### John 15:12-17
> **12** This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.
> **13** Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
> **14** Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
> **15** Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
> **16** Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
> **17** These things I command you, that ye love one another.

> **7** Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
> **8** He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.

### 1 John 3:22-24

## 6. Jesus on Lawlessness / Anomia (Mat 7:21-23, 13:41, 23:28, 24:12)

### Matthew 7:21-23
> **21** Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
> **22** Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
> **23** And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

**Context (Mat 7:12 -- Golden Rule):**
> **12** Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.

**Context (Mat 7:24-27 -- Wise and Foolish Builders):**
> **24** Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:
> **25** And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
> **26** And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:
> **27** And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.

### Matthew 13:41-42
> **41** The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
> **42** And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

> **28** Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

### Matthew 24:12
> **12** And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.

**Note:** In all four passages, the KJV translates anomia (G458) as "iniquity." The Greek term literally means "lawlessness" (a-nomia = without-law). The same word appears in 1 John 3:4 where John defines sin as anomia.

## 7. Weightier Matters of the Law (Mat 23:23-24)

### Matthew 23:23-24
> **23** Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier [matters] of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

**Context -- Matthew 23:1-3 (Moses' seat):**
> **1** Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
> **2** Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:
> **3** All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, [that] observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.

**OT Parallel -- Micah 6:8:**
> **8** He hath shewed thee, O man, what [is] good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?

> **8** For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, [as] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.

> **4** For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
> **5** But ye say, Whosoever shall say to [his] father or [his] mother, [It is] a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
> **6** And honour not his father or his mother, [he shall be free]. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.
> **7** [Ye] hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
