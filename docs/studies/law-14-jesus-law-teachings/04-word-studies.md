## [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- entole (commandment)

**Original:** ἐντολή
**Transliteration:** entole

**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Total KJV Occurrences:** 43 (BLB count: 71 including LXX)

## [G458](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g458/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- anomia (lawlessness/iniquity)

**Original:** ἀνομία
**Transliteration:** anomia
**Pronunciation:** an-om-ee-ah
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Total KJV Occurrences:** 13 (BLB count: 15 including LXX)

**Definition:** From [G459](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g459/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (anomos); illegality, i.e. violation of law or (genitive case) wickedness.

### Translations in KJV

| iniquities | 3 | 23.1% |
| to iniquity | 1 | 7.7% |
| unrighteousness | 1 | 7.7% |
| of iniquity | 1 | 7.7% |

### All NT Occurrences
| Reference | KJV Translation | Context |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Mat 7:23** | iniquity | "depart from me, ye that work **iniquity** [anomian]" |
| **Mat 13:41** | iniquity | "gather out...them which do **iniquity** [anomian]" |
| **Mat 23:28** | iniquity | "within ye are full of hypocrisy and **iniquity** [anomias]" |
| **Mat 24:12** | iniquity | "because **iniquity** [anomian] shall abound" |
| Rom 4:7 | iniquities | "whose **iniquities** [anomiai] are forgiven" (quoting Psa 32:1) |

| **1 John 3:4** (2x) | transgression of the law | "sin is the **transgression of the law** [anomia]" |

### Etymological Note
Anomia = a (negative prefix) + nomos (law) = "without law" or "lawlessness"
The word is structurally linked to nomos (G3551). To be in a state of anomia is to be in a state of opposition to or violation of nomos. The KJV often translates this as "iniquity," obscuring the law-connection visible in the Greek.

### Key Observation
Jesus uses anomia in:
- Mat 7:23 -- rejecting "workers of lawlessness" at the judgment
- Mat 13:41 -- angels gathering those who "do lawlessness" out of His kingdom
- Mat 23:28 -- Pharisees internally full of "lawlessness"
- Mat 24:12 -- end-time increase of "lawlessness" causing love to grow cold

John uses anomia in:
- 1 John 3:4 -- defines sin (hamartia) as anomia (lawlessness)

Both Jesus and John presuppose a law (nomos) against which sin (anomia = a-nomos) is measured.

**Part of Speech:** Adverb
**Total KJV Occurrences:** 2

**Definition:** Adverb from [G459](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g459/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; lawlessly, i.e. (specially) not amenable to (the Jewish) law.

## [G2537](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2537/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- kainos (new, in quality)

**Original:** καινός
**Transliteration:** kainos
**Pronunciation:** kahee-nos
**Part of Speech:** Adjective
**Total KJV Occurrences:** 39 (BLB count: 44 including LXX)

**Definition:** Of uncertain affinity; new (especially in freshness; while [G3501](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3501/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} neos is properly "new" in time).

### Translations in KJV
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| new | 23 | 59.0% |
| a new | 9 | 23.1% |
| other forms | 7 | 17.9% |

### Key Distinction: kainos vs. neos
- **kainos (G2537):** New in quality, freshness, character. Something qualitatively different or renewed.
- **neos (G3501):** New in time, recently made. Something chronologically recent.

### Key Verses
- **John 13:34** -- "A **new** [kainen] commandment I give unto you"
- **1 John 2:7-8** -- "I write no **new** [kainen] commandment...an old commandment...Again, a **new** [kainen] commandment I write unto you"

- **2 Cor 5:17** -- "a **new** [kaine] creature"

- **Rev 21:1,2,5** -- "a **new** [kainon] heaven and a **new** [kainen] earth...the **new** [kainen] Jerusalem...I make all things **new** [kaina]"

### Usage Pattern
Kainos is consistently used for qualitative renewal or deepening:
- New covenant = renewed/internalized covenant (not a brand new idea but the same law written on hearts)
- New creation = transformed quality of life
- New commandment = love deepened to the standard of Christ's love ("as I have loved you")
- New heaven and earth = purified/renewed creation

## [G1772](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1772/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- ennomos (in-law, lawful)

**Original:** ἔννομος
**Transliteration:** ennomos
**Pronunciation:** en-nom-os
**Part of Speech:** Adjective
**Total KJV Occurrences:** 2

**Definition:** From [G1722](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1722/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (en, in) and [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (nomos, law); (subjectively) legal, or (objectively) subject to law.

### Occurrences
- **Acts 19:39** -- "in a **lawful** [ennomo] assembly"
- **1 Cor 9:21** -- "being...under the law [ennomos] to Christ"

### Significance
Paul describes himself as ennomos Christou -- "in-law to Christ" or "under the law of Christ." This term places Paul within a law framework, not outside of all law. The en- prefix (within) contrasts with the a- prefix in a-nomos (without law).

### Occurrence
- **Col 2:20** -- "why...are ye subject to **ordinances** [dogmatizesthe]?"

### Significance
This is the only NT occurrence. It refers specifically to submitting to decrees/ordinances (dogmata), the same word family used in Col 2:14 (dogmasin) for what was "blotted out" and "nailed to the cross." This vocabulary is distinct from entole (G1785, commandment) and nomos (G3551, law). *(Studied in detail in law-08)*

**Notes:** The "new" (kainen, G2537) modifies "commandment" (entolen, G1785). The purpose clause (hina + subjunctive) shows the commandment's content: "that you should love [agapate] one another." The standard is Christ's love (kathos egapesa humas = "as I have loved you"), stated in the aorist tense indicating completed action.

| ἀνομία | ἀνομία | [G458](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g458/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | Noun, Nom Sg F ("lawlessness") |

**Notes:** The structure is an identity statement: "he hamartia estin he anomia" = "the sin IS the lawlessness." Both nouns have the definite article (he), making this a convertible proposition: sin = lawlessness and lawlessness = sin. The present tense participle (poion) indicates habitual/ongoing action. The equation is absolute: sin is defined as anomia (lawlessness).

### Matthew 7:23
Greek: καὶ τότε ὁμολογήσω αὐτοῖς ὅτι Οὐδέποτε ἔγνων ὑμᾶς· ἀποχωρεῖτε ἀπ' ἐμοῦ οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι τὴν ἀνομίαν.

**Notes:** "Hoi ergazomenoi ten anomian" = "the ones working the lawlessness." The present participle (ergazomenoi) indicates ongoing, habitual practice of lawlessness. The definite article before anomian (ten anomian) points to a specific, recognized lawlessness -- not vague wickedness but violation of THE law. Jesus rejects them not for lack of religious activity (they prophesied, cast out devils, did works) but for practicing lawlessness.

### Matthew 23:23
Greek: Οὐαὶ ὑμῖν, γραμματεῖς καὶ Φαρισαῖοι ὑποκριταί, ὅτι ἀποδεκατοῦτε τὸ ἡδύοσμον καὶ τὸ ἄνηθον καὶ τὸ κύμινον, καὶ ἀφήκατε τὰ βαρύτερα τοῦ νόμου, τὴν κρίσιν καὶ τὸ ἔλεος καὶ τὴν πίστιν· ταῦτα δὲ ἔδει ποιῆσαι κἀκεῖνα μὴ ἀφεῖναι.

**Notes:** "Ta barutera tou nomou" = "the weightier things of the law." The comparative adjective barutera (heavier/weightier) implies the law has matters of differing weight -- not that some are dispensable, but that some are more fundamental. The final clause "tauta de edei poiesai kakeina me apheinai" = "these things [weightier matters] it was necessary to do, and those things [tithing] not to leave undone." The imperfect of dei (edei, "it was necessary") with the aorist infinitives creates an obligation statement: BOTH the weightier AND the lesser matters of the law must be done.
