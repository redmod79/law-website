## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### A. The Two-Stage Delivery -- Stage 1: God Speaks the Decalogue Directly

#### Exodus 19:16-25 (The Theophany at Sinai)

**Context:** God descends on Sinai in fire, smoke, thunder, and trumpet blast. The people have been sanctified for three days. The explicit purpose stated in 19:9 is "that the people may hear when I speak with thee."

**Direct statement:** God appeared in a theophany of unprecedented magnitude -- fire, smoke, earthquake, trumpet -- and the people were assembled at the base of the mountain to hear God's voice directly.

**Key observations:**
- The text establishes a direct-communication event. God told Moses in 19:9 that He would speak "in a thick cloud, that the people may hear." The people were the intended audience.
- The theophany markers (fire, smoke, earthquake, trumpet) are unique in Scripture for a law-giving event. This level of divine manifestation is not repeated for the mishpatim (Exo 21-23) or the sanctuary instructions (Exo 25-31).
- The verb "God answered him by a voice" (19:19) confirms audible divine speech in a public setting.

**Cross-references:** Hebrews 12:18-21 recalls this theophany and its terrifying nature. Deuteronomy 4:33 asks, "Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?" -- treating this as a singular event in human history.

---

#### Exodus 20:1-17 (The Ten Commandments -- God Speaks Directly)

**Context:** Immediately following the theophany. God addresses the assembled people.

**Direct statement:** "And God spake all these words" (20:1). God delivers the Ten Commandments directly to the assembled people. No mediator is mentioned. The speaker is identified as God Himself.

**Key observations:**
- The opening formula "God spake all these words" (Elohim dabar) identifies God as the direct speaker. This formula is not used to introduce the mishpatim (Exo 21:1 shifts to Moses as the relay).
- The phrase "all these words" (kol ha-debarim ha-elleh) is later used as a technical designation: "These words the LORD spake" (Deu 5:22) -- with "he added no more."
- The content of the Decalogue addresses fundamental moral relationships: duty to God (commandments 1-4) and duty to neighbor (commandments 5-10). The tenth commandment addresses internal disposition ("thou shalt not covet"), demonstrating a law that governs thoughts, not just actions.
- The Sabbath commandment (20:8-11) grounds itself in creation, not in any ceremonial or national event: "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth."

**Cross-references:** Deuteronomy 4:12-13 confirms: "The LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire...He declared unto you his covenant, even ten commandments." Deuteronomy 5:4: "The LORD talked with you face to face."

---

#### Exodus 20:18-21 (The People Request Mediation)

**Context:** Immediately after God finishes speaking the Ten Commandments. The people have witnessed the theophany and heard God's voice.

**Direct statement:** "All the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off." They said to Moses: "Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die."

**Key observations:**
- The text records a pivotal narrative moment: the people request a change in the mode of communication. Before this point, God spoke directly; after this point, Moses serves as mediator.
- The people's request creates a structural break in the narrative. Everything before 20:18 is direct divine speech to the people. Everything after 20:22 is mediated through Moses.
- Moses' response in 20:20 -- "Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not" -- indicates the purpose of the direct speech: to produce a lasting impression of God's authority. The word "prove" (nasah) indicates testing.
- The text states "the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was" (20:21) -- the physical separation now mirrors the communicative separation.

**Cross-references:** Deuteronomy 5:23-27 provides the parallel account: the people request Moses to mediate all subsequent communication. Deuteronomy 5:28 records God's response: "They have well said all that they have spoken." God approves the mediation arrangement for everything beyond the Decalogue.

---

#### Exodus 20:22-26 (Transition: God Now Speaks to Moses)

**Context:** After the people request mediation. God now speaks to Moses alone.

**Direct statement:** "The LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel." God confirms the transition: "Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven" (acknowledging the direct communication just completed), then gives altar instructions through Moses.

**Key observations:**
- The phrase "Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel" marks the shift. God now instructs Moses to relay, rather than addressing the people directly.
- Verse 22 functions as a transition hinge: God acknowledges the direct speech phase just ended ("I have talked with you from heaven") and begins the mediated phase.
- The content that follows (altar instructions, 20:23-26) is a different category of legislation -- worship regulations, not the fundamental moral law of the Decalogue.

---

### B. The Two-Stage Delivery -- Stage 2: Laws Given Through Moses as Mediator

#### Exodus 21:1 (The "Judgments" Begin)

**Context:** The text transitions from the Decalogue (spoken by God directly) to the judgments (relayed by Moses).

**Direct statement:** "Now these are the judgments [mishpatim] which thou shalt set before them."

**Key observations:**
- The introduction "thou shalt set before them" addresses Moses. Moses is now the intermediary who will "set before" the people these regulations. This is a structurally different formula from "God spake all these words" (20:1).
- The word mishpatim (H4941) is the technical term for the judicial/civil regulations. Deuteronomy 4:14 will later explicitly distinguish these from "his covenant, even ten commandments."
- The content that follows (Exo 21-23) addresses civil matters: slavery regulations (21:2-11), personal injury laws (21:12-36), property laws (22:1-15), social regulations (22:16-31), judicial procedures (23:1-9), and ceremonial instructions (23:10-19). This is a different genre of legislation from the Decalogue.
- The mishpatim are practical applications of the principles stated in the Decalogue. For example, the laws about killing (21:12-14) apply the sixth commandment; the laws about theft (22:1-4) apply the eighth commandment. The Continues position infers from this that the mishpatim serve as case law expanding the Decalogue. The Abolished position may view both as equally part of one law system.

---

#### Exodus 24:1-18 (The Covenant Ceremony)

**Context:** After the mishpatim are given. Moses conducts a covenant ratification ceremony.

**Direct statement:** Moses came and told the people "all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments" (24:3). "Moses wrote all the words of the LORD" (24:4). He took "the book of the covenant" and read it (24:7). Blood was sprinkled on the people (24:8). Then God says to Moses: "Come up to me into the mount...and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written" (24:12).

**Key observations:**
- Verse 3 distinguishes "all the words of the LORD" from "all the judgments" -- suggesting two categories relayed.
- Verse 4: "Moses wrote all the words of the LORD." Moses is the author of this document. Contrast with the stone tablets, where "the writing was the writing of God" (32:16).
- Verse 7: The document Moses wrote is called "the book of the covenant." This is a distinct physical object from the "tables of the covenant" (Deu 9:9, 11).
- Verse 12: God says He will give Moses "tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written." God identifies Himself as the writer of the stone tablets. This is stated AFTER Moses wrote the "book of the covenant." The two documents have different authors: Moses wrote the book; God wrote the tablets.
- The blood ceremony (24:5-8) ratifies the entire covenant arrangement -- both the Decalogue and the judgments. Both are part of the covenant package, but the text distinguishes them by authorship and medium.

---

#### Exodus 25:1-22 (Sanctuary Instructions)

**Context:** Moses is on the mountain for forty days (24:18). God gives detailed instructions for the tabernacle.

**Direct statement:** "The LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel..." (25:1-2). The ark is to be built, and "thou shalt put into the ark the testimony [eduth] which I shall give thee" (25:16).

**Key observations:**
- These instructions are given to Moses alone on the mountain. The people do not hear any of this directly.
- The sanctuary/ceremonial instructions (Exo 25-31) represent a third category of legislation: not the moral law (Decalogue), not the civil/judicial law (mishpatim), but the ceremonial/worship system. All three are given through different modes.
- The word "testimony" (eduth, H5715) in 25:16, 21 is the term used for the stone tablets containing the Decalogue. The ark is designed as a receptacle for the Decalogue specifically.
- Verse 22: "There I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat...of all things which I will give thee in commandment." The ark of the testimony -- containing the Decalogue -- is the focal point of God's continued communication.

---

#### Exodus 31:18 (The Stone Tablets Given)

**Context:** After all sanctuary instructions are complete.

**Direct statement:** "He gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God."

**Key observations:**
- The phrase "when he had made an end of communing" indicates the entire mountain session (sanctuary instructions, Exo 25-31) concluded with the giving of the physical tablets.
- Three designations in one verse: "tables of testimony" (naming convention), "tables of stone" (medium), "written with the finger of God" (author). Each distinguishes the Decalogue from the other legislation.
- The "finger of God" (etsba Elohim) is used in only three OT contexts: the plague recognition (Exo 8:19), and the two references to the tablet writing (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10). This authorship marker is unique to the Decalogue.

---

### C. The Two Repositories

#### Exodus 25:16, 21 and Exodus 40:20 (Testimony Placed INSIDE the Ark)

**Context:** Instructions for the ark (25:16, 21) and the execution of those instructions (40:20).

**Direct statement:** "Thou shalt put into the ark the testimony" (25:16). "In the ark thou shalt put the testimony" (25:21). "He took and put the testimony into the ark" (40:20).

**Key observations:**
- Three repetitions in the instructions (25:16, 21, 22) emphasize the tablets go inside the ark. The narrative confirms execution in 40:20.
- The word "into" (el-toch in 25:16; be-toch in 25:21) is a spatial preposition meaning "inside/within."
- The Decalogue alone occupies the most sacred space in the tabernacle -- inside the ark, beneath the mercy seat, in the Most Holy Place.

---

#### Deuteronomy 10:1-5 (Moses Recounts Placing the Tables)

**Context:** Moses recounts the replacement of the broken tablets (after the golden calf incident).

**Direct statement:** God said: "I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables" and "thou shalt put them in the ark" (10:2). Moses confirms: "I...put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be" (10:5).

**Key observations:**
- God wrote the replacement tablets: "He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments" (10:4). The content is the same; the author is the same (God).
- The phrase "the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly" (10:4) contains multiple identifying markers: the number (ten), the speaker (the LORD), the delivery mode (spake unto you), the setting (the mount, the fire), and the occasion (the day of the assembly).
- Moses confirms the tablets were placed inside the ark: "there they be, as the LORD commanded me" (10:5).

---

#### 1 Kings 8:9 and 2 Chronicles 5:10 (Only the Tablets Were Inside)

**Context:** Solomon's temple dedication, centuries after Sinai.

**Direct statement:** "There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb" (1Ki 8:9). The parallel account: "There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb" (2Ch 5:10).

**Key observations:**
- The exclusive statement "nothing...save" confirms only the Decalogue tablets were inside the ark. Neither the book of the law nor any other document was inside.
- Hebrews 9:4 mentions additional items "wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant." The manna and rod were associated with the ark (placed before it, Exo 16:33-34; Num 17:10) but according to the explicit OT statement, not inside it by Solomon's time. This difference is noted but does not affect the central observation: the Decalogue tablets were inside the ark.

---

#### Deuteronomy 31:9, 24-26 (The Book of the Law Placed BESIDE the Ark)

**Context:** Near the end of Moses' life. He has finished writing "this law" in a book.

**Direct statement:** "Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests" (31:9). "When Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished" (31:24). "Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark" (31:26).

**Key observations:**
- Moses is the author of this document ("Moses wrote"). God wrote the tablets (Exo 31:18; Deu 10:4). Different authors.
- The medium is a book (sepher), not stone tablets (luchoth). Different media.
- The location is "in the side of" (mitstsad) the ark -- beside it, not inside it. The preposition mitstsad (H6654) means "side" or "beside." This is spatially distinct from "into" (el-toch/be-toch) the ark where the tablets were placed.
- The purpose stated for the book is "that it may be there for a witness against thee" (31:26). The book of the law serves as a witness against Israel. The tablets inside the ark are called "the testimony" (eduth) -- God's testimony.

**Summary of the two repositories:**

| Feature | Stone Tablets (Decalogue) | Book of the Law |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Author | God (Exo 31:18; Deu 10:4) | Moses (Deu 31:9, 24) |
| Medium | Stone tablets | A book (scroll) |
| Location | INSIDE the ark (Exo 25:16; 40:20; Deu 10:5) | BESIDE the ark (Deu 31:26) |
| Content | The Ten Commandments (Deu 10:4) | "This law" -- statutes, judgments, etc. |
| Designation | "The testimony" / "tables of the covenant" | "Book of the law" / "this law" |

### D. Moses' Explicit Distinctions in Deuteronomy

#### Deuteronomy 4:10-14 (The Core Distinction)

**Context:** Moses addresses the new generation before they enter Canaan. He recounts the Sinai event.

**Direct statement:** "The LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice" (4:12). "And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone" (4:13). "And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments" (4:14).

**Key observations:**
- Verse 13 identifies three things simultaneously: (a) "his covenant" -- the covenant belongs to God; (b) "even ten commandments" -- the content is the Decalogue; (c) "he wrote them upon two tables of stone" -- the medium and author.
- Verse 14 introduces a different category with a different delivery mode: "the LORD commanded ME" -- Moses is now the agent. The content is "statutes and judgments" (chuqqim and mishpatim) -- different terms from "his covenant, even ten commandments."
- The juxtaposition is sequential and explicit: verse 13 addresses what God declared directly; verse 14 addresses what God commanded Moses to teach. The shift from God declaring to Moses teaching mirrors the shift in Exodus 20 from God speaking directly (20:1-17) to Moses mediating (20:22ff.).
- Both the Continues and the Abolished positions acknowledge the textual distinction in these verses. The disagreement concerns what the distinction implies for the ongoing authority of each category.

---

#### Deuteronomy 5:1-33 (Moses Recounts the Full Sinai Event)

**Context:** Moses' second retelling of the Sinai event to the new generation.

**Direct statement (key verses):**
- 5:4: "The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire."
- 5:5: "(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount.)"
- 5:22: "These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me."
- 5:27: "Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee."
- 5:28: "I have heard the voice of the words of this people...they have well said all that they have spoken."
- 5:31: "But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them."

**Key observations:**
- Verse 4 states God spoke "face to face" -- the most direct form of communication possible.
- Verse 5 is a parenthetical: Moses' mediation role existed even during the direct speech. The text explains: "for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount." Moses stood between, but the people still heard God's voice (v.4).
- Verse 22 contains the phrase "he added no more" (lo yasaph). After the Ten Commandments, God stopped speaking directly to the assembly. This phrase marks a definitive boundary. All subsequent legislation came through a different delivery mode.
- Verse 22 also states: "he wrote them in two tables of stone." The writing by God follows the speaking by God. Both the auditory and written forms of the Decalogue are attributed directly to God.
- Verses 23-27: The people's response after hearing God's voice. They request mediation for all future divine communication. This is the pivotal moment in the narrative.
- Verse 28: God approves the request ("they have well said"). The mediation arrangement is divinely sanctioned.
- Verse 31: God tells Moses to remain and receive "all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments." The word "all" (kol) combined with three distinct terms (mitsvah, choq, mishpat) indicates a comprehensive body of legislation -- given to Moses, not spoken directly to the people.

---

#### Deuteronomy 9:9-11 (Tables of Stone = Tables of the Covenant)

**Context:** Moses recounts the first forty days on the mountain.

**Direct statement:** "The tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you" (9:9). "Two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount" (9:10). "The LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant" (9:11).

**Key observations:**
- The stone tablets are equated with the covenant twice: "tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant" (9:9, 11). The conjunction "even" (a rendering of the Hebrew appositional construction) makes the identification explicit: the stone tablets ARE the covenant.
- The content of the tablets is identified as "all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount" (9:10) -- referring back to the Decalogue of Exodus 20/Deuteronomy 5.
- Three identifying features are repeated: stone medium, divine authorship (finger of God), and the direct-speech content.

---

### E. The Naming Conventions

#### Exodus 32:15-16 (The Tables Described)

**Direct statement:** "The two tables of the testimony were in his hand" (32:15). "The tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables" (32:16).

**Key observations:**
- "Tables of the testimony" -- the naming convention eduth (testimony/witness) is used. This term (H5715) is used exclusively for the Decalogue tablets in the Pentateuchal narrative.
- "The work of God" -- the tablets themselves were made by God. "The writing was the writing of God" -- the inscription was made by God. Both the medium and the content are attributed entirely to God, distinguishing them from every other document in the Mosaic legislation.

---

#### Exodus 34:27-29 (Words of the Covenant / Tables of Testimony)

**Direct statement:** "He wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments" (34:28). "Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand" (34:29).

**Key observations:**
- Verse 27 says "Write thou these words" -- directed to Moses. Verse 28 says "he wrote upon the tables" -- the subject of "he" in the Hebrew context has been debated. Given Exodus 34:1 ("I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables") and Deuteronomy 10:4 ("He [God] wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments"), the consistent testimony identifies God as the writer of the tablets.
- The tablets are simultaneously called "the words of the covenant" and "the ten commandments" (34:28). Two naming conventions applied to the same object.
- In verse 29, they are called "tables of testimony" -- a third naming convention.

---

#### Exodus 24:7 ("The Book of the Covenant")

**Direct statement:** "He took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people."

**Key observations:**
- This document is called "the book of the covenant" (sepher ha-berith). It is a book (sepher), not tablets (luchoth). It was written by Moses (24:4), not by God. It contains "all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments" (24:3).
- The naming convention "book of the covenant" applies to Moses' written document. The naming convention "tables of the covenant" applies to the stone tablets God wrote. Both use berith (covenant), but the qualifying nouns are different: "book" vs. "tables."

**Summary of naming conventions:**

| Name | Applied to | Reference |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| "Tables of the covenant" | Stone tablets (Decalogue) | Deu 9:9, 11 |
| "Tables of testimony" | Stone tablets (Decalogue) | Exo 31:18; 34:29 |
| "The testimony" | Stone tablets (Decalogue) | Exo 25:16, 21; 40:20 |
| "His covenant, even ten commandments" | The Decalogue | Deu 4:13 |
| "Words of the covenant, the ten commandments" | The Decalogue | Exo 34:28 |
| "The book of the covenant" | Moses' written document | Exo 24:7 |
| "This book of the law" | Moses' written document | Deu 31:26 |
| "This law" | Moses' written legislation | Deu 31:9, 24 |

---

### F. Related Cross-References

#### Galatians 3:19-20 (The Law Ordained Through a Mediator)

**Context:** Paul discusses the relationship between the Abrahamic promise and the law.

**Direct statement:** "Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one."

**Key observations:**
- Paul states the law was given "in the hand of a mediator" (en cheiri mesitou). The word mesites (G3316) denotes a go-between.
- Verse 20 contrasts the mediator arrangement with God acting alone: "a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one." This distinguishes mediated legislation from God's direct act.
- The Continues position infers that this statement applies to the mediated legislation (mishpatim, ceremonial law) given through Moses after the people requested mediation, not to the Decalogue which God spoke directly. The Abolished position may read "the law" as inclusive of all Sinai legislation.
- The referent of "the law" is not specified in the verse as either the moral law or the ceremonial system. The context discusses the law in relation to the Abrahamic promise.
- Acts 7:38, 53 and Hebrews 2:2 similarly reference the law being mediated by angels. Stephen says Moses "received the lively oracles to give unto us" (Acts 7:38) -- describing Moses as a recipient and relay, consistent with the mediation narrative.

---

#### Nehemiah 9:13-14 (Retrospective on Sinai)

**Context:** The Levites' prayer recounting Israel's history, centuries after Sinai.

**Direct statement:** "Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments" (9:13). "And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant" (9:14).

**Key observations:**
- Verse 13 describes God's direct action: "spakest with them from heaven." The verb "spakest" (dabar) with the preposition "with them" (immahem) indicates direct communication with the people.
- Verse 14 shifts to mediated action: "commandedst them...by the hand of Moses thy servant." The phrase "by the hand of" (be-yad) is the standard Hebrew idiom for mediation/instrumentality.
- The Sabbath is specifically mentioned in connection with the direct communication from heaven (v.14a: "madest known unto them thy holy sabbath"). The Continues position notes that the Sabbath is placed in the category of what God directly communicated.
- This retrospective by a later author (the Levites in Nehemiah's time) maintains the same two-mode distinction found in the Exodus narrative itself: direct speech vs. mediation through Moses.

---

#### Hebrews 12:18-26 (NT Recollection of Sinai)

**Context:** The author of Hebrews contrasts the old covenant experience at Sinai with the new covenant experience at heavenly Zion.

**Direct statement:** The Sinai event featured "fire...blackness, and darkness, and tempest...the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more" (12:18-19). The author contrasts this with "Jesus the mediator of the new covenant" (12:24).

**Key observations:**
- The author recalls the people's request ("intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more") -- this is the mediation request of Exodus 20:19/Deuteronomy 5:25-27.
- Verse 25: "Him that spake on earth...him that speaketh from heaven." The divine voice is noted as speaking both "on earth" (at Sinai) and "from heaven" -- consistent with Nehemiah 9:13's description.
- The passage treats the Sinai voice as the voice of God Himself, not of an angelic intermediary. The fear response of the people is attributed to the direct encounter with God.

---

#### 2 Corinthians 3:3-14 (Written and Engraven in Stones)

**Context:** Paul contrasts the old and new covenant ministrations.

**Direct statement:** "The ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious" (3:7). "If that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious" (3:11). Paul also references "not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart" (3:3).

**Key observations:**
- The phrase "written and engraven in stones" explicitly identifies the Decalogue (the only law written on stone by God).
- The passage uses cessation language: "done away" (katargeo), "abolished" (3:13). The grammatical subject of what is "done away" is debated. Verse 7 says "which glory was to be done away" -- the referent of "which glory" is the glory on Moses' face (v.7b: "the glory of his countenance"). Verse 13: "that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished" -- the referent of "that which is abolished" can be read as the glory (fading) or the old covenant ministration.
- The Continues position reads the passage as: the old covenant administration/glory fades, but the law itself continues (written on hearts, v.3, per Jer 31:33). The Abolished position reads it as: the law written on stone itself is "done away."
- This passage requires detailed examination in a dedicated study (2-corinthians-3-ministration). For this study, the observation is that 2 Corinthians 3:7 uses the phrase "written and engraven in stones" -- which identifies the Decalogue by its unique medium.

*(Examined in depth in 2-corinthians-3-ministration.)*

---

#### Leviticus 26:46

**Direct statement:** "These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses."

**Key observations:**
- This verse describes the legislation given "by the hand of Moses" (be-yad Moshe) -- the same mediator formula as Nehemiah 9:14.
- The terms are "statutes and judgments and laws" (chuqqoth, mishpatim, towroth) -- the same terms distinguished from "his covenant, even ten commandments" in Deuteronomy 4:13-14.
- This closing formula at the end of the Levitical legislation attributes these laws to God's authorship through Moses' mediation. The Decalogue, by contrast, was spoken directly by God and written by God's finger.

---

#### Hosea 8:12

**Direct statement:** "I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing."

**Key observations:**
- God says "I have written" (echtov) -- using the first person. God claims authorship of the written law. In the historical context, God literally wrote the Decalogue with His finger (Exo 31:18).
- "The great things of my law" (rubbou torati) -- the content is called "great things" and "my law." God claims ownership.
- This is consistent with the testimony that the Decalogue is uniquely God's own writing.

---

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Consistent Two-Mode Distinction Across Authors and Centuries

The distinction between God's direct speech (Decalogue) and mediated legislation (everything else) is maintained by:
- The Exodus narrative itself (Exo 20:1 vs. 20:22 and 21:1)
- Moses' retrospective (Deu 4:13-14; 5:22, 31)
- The Levitical closing (Lev 26:46)
- The Nehemiah retrospective (Neh 9:13-14)
- The Hebrews author (Heb 12:18-21)
- Paul's mediator reference (Gal 3:19-20)

### Pattern 2: Consistent Two-Repository Distinction

The spatial distinction between inside and beside the ark is stated by:
- Exodus instructions (25:16, 21)
- Exodus execution narrative (40:20)
- Moses' retrospective (Deu 10:5)
- Moses' book placement (Deu 31:26)
- Solomon's confirmation (1Ki 8:9; 2Ch 5:10)

### Pattern 3: Consistent Authorship Distinction

The Decalogue authorship (God) vs. other legislation authorship (Moses) is stated by:
- Exodus 31:18: "written with the finger of God"
- Exodus 32:16: "the writing was the writing of God"
- Deuteronomy 9:10: "written with the finger of God"
- Deuteronomy 10:4: "he [God] wrote on the tables"
- Contrasted with:
- Exodus 24:4: "Moses wrote all the words of the LORD"
- Deuteronomy 31:9: "Moses wrote this law"
- Deuteronomy 31:24: "Moses had made an end of writing"

### Pattern 4: Consistent Naming Convention Distinction

The Decalogue is called: "the testimony," "tables of the covenant," "his covenant, even ten commandments," "tables of testimony."
Moses' legislation is called: "the book of the covenant," "this book of the law," "this law," "statutes and judgments."

### Pattern 5: The Boundary Marker "He Added No More"

Deuteronomy 5:22 states "he added no more" (lo yasaph). This phrase marks a boundary between what God spoke directly (the Decalogue) and what followed (through Moses). The phrase is unique in Scripture for this purpose.

## Connections Between Passages

### The Exodus-Deuteronomy Narrative Arc

The Exodus narrative (chapters 19-31) presents the events in real time. Deuteronomy (chapters 4-5, 9-10, 31) presents Moses' retrospective interpretation of those events for the next generation. The fact that Moses, decades later, still maintains the same distinctions (delivery mode, authorship, repository) indicates these are not incidental but structurally significant to the narrative.

### The NT Authors' Reception

The NT authors maintain the Sinai narrative's distinctions:
- Hebrews 12:18-21 recalls the theophany and the people's fear response
- 2 Corinthians 3:7 identifies "written and engraven in stones" as a distinct medium
- Galatians 3:19-20 references the mediation arrangement
- Hebrews 9:4 lists the "tables of the covenant" as the ark's contents
- Acts 7:38 describes Moses receiving "lively oracles to give unto us"

### The Covenant-Repository Connection

The Decalogue inside the ark represents the covenant's terms, while the ark itself is called "the ark of the covenant." The mercy seat above the ark (the place of atonement, Lev 16) is directly above the law. The connection between law and atonement is spatial and physical in the sanctuary design.

## Word Study Insights

### eduth (H5715) -- "testimony"

The word eduth is used exclusively for the Decalogue tablets in the Pentateuchal narrative: "tables of testimony," "the testimony," "ark of the testimony," "tabernacle of testimony." It is never used for the mishpatim or the book of the law in the Pentateuch. This constitutes a consistent naming convention distinguishing the Decalogue.

### berith (H1285) -- "covenant"

Berith is applied to both documents: "his covenant, even ten commandments" (Deu 4:13) and "the book of the covenant" (Exo 24:7). The word itself does not distinguish the two; the qualifying phrases do. "His covenant" (beritho) with the possessive pronoun points to the Decalogue. "The book of the covenant" (sepher ha-berith) points to Moses' document.

### mishpat (H4941) -- "judgment"

Mishpat introduces the civil/judicial legislation in Exodus 21:1 ("these are the judgments") and is one of the terms Moses explicitly distinguishes from the Decalogue in Deuteronomy 4:14 ("statutes and judgments").

### towrah (H8451) -- "law/torah"

Towrah has a broad semantic range. In Deuteronomy 31:9, 24, 26, it refers to the book Moses wrote. In Exodus 24:12, it may refer to the stone tablets. Context determines which document is meant. The word alone does not distinguish the categories.

### etsba (H676) -- "finger"

"Finger of God" (etsba Elohim) is used only for the Decalogue writing (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10) and the plague recognition (Exo 8:19). The authorship marker is unique and exclusive.

### mesites (G3316) -- "mediator"

Paul's statement that the law was given "in the hand of a mediator" (Gal 3:19) aligns with the Exodus narrative where Moses functions as mediator for all post-Decalogue legislation. The Decalogue was spoken directly by God (no mediator for the initial delivery to the people). The mediator concept applies to the second stage of the two-stage delivery.

## Difficult Passages

### 2 Corinthians 3:7 -- "Written and Engraven in Stones...Done Away"

This passage explicitly references the Decalogue ("written and engraven in stones") in a context that uses cessation vocabulary. The grammatical analysis shows "which glory was to be done away" -- the subject being grammatically linked to "the glory of his countenance" rather than the law itself. The passage is addressed in a dedicated study (2-corinthians-3-ministration). For this study's scope, the observation is that 2 Corinthians 3:7 is the passage that most directly applies cessation language in proximity to a Decalogue reference.

### Galatians 3:19 -- "The Law...Ordained in the Hand of a Mediator"

If "the law" here includes the Decalogue, the mediation reference creates a difficulty for the two-mode distinction. However, the Decalogue was initially spoken by God directly (Exo 20:1); Moses' mediating role came after the people's request (Exo 20:19). The Galatians 3:19 context discusses the law that was "added because of transgressions" -- which more naturally describes the regulatory legislation added after the Decalogue. The referent is not specified.

### Hebrews 9:4 -- Items Inside the Ark

Hebrews 9:4 lists "the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant" as being inside the ark. 1 Kings 8:9 states "there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone." This apparent discrepancy concerns the time reference: by Solomon's era, only the tablets remained. The manna and rod were originally placed "before the testimony" (Exo 16:34; Num 17:10) -- which could mean in front of the ark rather than inside it. The Hebrews author may describe the original full arrangement or use a broader spatial description. Neither reading affects the core observation that the Decalogue tablets were the primary and permanent contents of the ark.

### Deuteronomy 5:5 -- Moses' Mediation During the Decalogue

Deuteronomy 5:5 states Moses "stood between the LORD and you at that time." This could suggest Moses mediated even the Decalogue. However, the immediately preceding verse (5:4) states "The LORD talked with you face to face." The parenthetical nature of 5:5 ("for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount") explains Moses' intermediary position without negating the direct speech of 5:4. Moses stood in a mediating position, but the people still heard God's voice directly (confirmed by 5:22-24).
