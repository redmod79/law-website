# How Does the Exodus Narrative Distinguish the Decalogue from the Laws Given Afterward?

## Question
How does the Exodus narrative distinguish the Decalogue from the laws given afterward? Investigate the two-stage giving of the law: (1) God speaks the Ten Commandments directly to the people (Exo 20:1-17), the people tremble and ask Moses to mediate (Exo 20:18-21); (2) God gives additional "judgments" through Moses (Exo 21-23), the sanctuary/ceremonial instructions through Moses (Exo 25-31). Examine the two repositories: tables of stone placed INSIDE the Ark (Exo 25:16; Deu 10:1-5) vs. the book of the law placed BESIDE the Ark (Deu 31:24-26). Study Deu 4:13-14 where Moses explicitly distinguishes "his covenant, the ten commandments" from "statutes and judgments." Deu 5:22: "These words the LORD spake... and he added no more."

## Summary Answer
The Exodus-Deuteronomy narrative presents a consistent textual distinction between the Decalogue and all subsequent legislation across five dimensions: (1) delivery mode -- God spoke the Ten Commandments directly to the assembly; all other laws came through Moses as mediator after the people requested mediation; (2) authorship -- God wrote the Decalogue with His own finger on stone; Moses wrote the additional laws in a book; (3) repository -- the stone tablets were placed inside the ark; the book of the law was placed beside the ark; (4) naming conventions -- the tablets are called "the testimony," "tables of the covenant," and "his covenant, even ten commandments"; Moses' document is called "the book of the covenant" and "this book of the law"; (5) boundary marker -- "he added no more" (Deu 5:22). These distinctions are maintained across the Exodus narrative, Moses' Deuteronomy retrospectives, the Levitical closing (Lev 26:46), the Nehemiah retrospective (Neh 9:13-14), and the NT references (Heb 12:18-21; Gal 3:19-20; 2 Cor 3:7). The textual data is consistent across multiple authors, genres, and centuries.

## Key Verses

**Exodus 20:1** -- "And God spake all these words, saying" (God speaks the Decalogue directly)

**Exodus 20:19** -- "Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die" (the people request mediation)

**Exodus 21:1** -- "Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them" (mediated legislation begins)

**Deuteronomy 4:13** -- "He declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone."

**Deuteronomy 4:14** -- "And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments."

**Deuteronomy 5:22** -- "These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly...with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone."

**Exodus 25:16** -- "Thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee."

**Deuteronomy 31:26** -- "Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark."

**Exodus 31:18** -- "Two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God."

**1 Kings 8:9** -- "There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone."

| E28 | The Decalogue tablets are called "the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you" (Deu 9:9). The identifying conjunction "even" makes the equation explicit. | Deu 9:9, 11 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Naming convention observation, same as E006.) | E006 (exists -- "Also In" update) |

| E33 | "The ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious...which glory was to be done away." | 2Co 3:7 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: "done away" is cessation vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: The grammatical subject of "done away" is "which glory" (referring to "the glory of his countenance," v.7b). The referent of the cessation language is the glory on Moses' face, not the law itself. Moreover, the passage says the ministration was "glorious," affirming its quality. Step 3: RC1 -- "done away" applies to the glory, not the law. RC2: "The glory associated with the old covenant ministration of the stone-engraved law was transient." RC3: Neither V1 nor V2 applies to the law itself. -> Neutral. *(Examined in depth in 2-corinthians-3-ministration.)* | E048 (exists) |
| E34 | Paul writes: "Not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart." | 2Co 3:3 | Continues | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral per vocabulary scan. OVERRIDE: Paul's contrast between "tables of stone" and "fleshy tables of the heart" presupposes a medium distinction (stone vs. heart) that evidences the Bible's distinction between the Decalogue (written on stone) and other legislation. The Continues position argues the Bible distinguishes moral from ceremonial/civil law; the Abolished position denies any such distinction. Evidence of a distinction supports Continues. -> Continues. | E118 (new) |

Gate 1: PASS -- the Sabbath commandment within the Decalogue is explicitly identified. Gate 2: PASS -- imperative mood. Gate 3: PASS -- legal/didactic. Gate 4: No conflict. PASS. -> CONTINUES. | E086 (exists) |
| E38 | The Shema: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates." | Deu 6:4-9 | Neutral | V1: No continuation/cessation vocabulary specific to the moral/ceremonial distinction. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: the Shema is a didactic command about loving God and teaching His words. It is a textual observation relevant as context for the historical pairing with the Decalogue in synagogue liturgy.) | E260 (new) |

| N5 | Moses draws an explicit textual distinction in Deuteronomy 4:13-14 between "his covenant, even ten commandments" (declared by God directly, written on stone) and "statutes and judgments" (given through Moses as teacher). The subject of v.13 is God declaring; the subject of v.14 is God commanding Moses to teach. | E001, E005, E013, E101 | Continues | E13/E101 directly quotes the two consecutive verses where Moses uses different designations and different delivery modes. The distinction is in the text itself -- Moses states it. No reader can deny that Moses uses two different designations in consecutive verses. | Gate 0: N-Test 1: YES -- both positions acknowledge the textual distinction in Deu 4:13-14.

### 3. Inferences Table

Each I-item below has been processed through **Tree 2 (I-Type Classification)** and **Tree 5 (I-Item Positional Classification)**.

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that the moral law (Decalogue) and the ceremonial/civil law are two categorically distinct bodies of legislation, based on the five textual distinctions (delivery mode, authorship, repository, naming conventions, boundary marker). | I-A | N1/N001 (two delivery modes). N2/N002 (two repositories). N3/N011 (two authorships). N4/N012 (two naming conventions). N5/N013 (explicit distinction in Deu 4:13-14). N6/N014 ("he added no more" boundary). All five dimensions consistently separate the Decalogue from all other legislation. | The Bible presents five dimensions of distinction (all at N-tier). The claim that these constitute two "categorically distinct bodies of legislation" systematizes these five observations into a doctrinal framework. The individual N-items are each independently verifiable; the combined claim that they prove "categorical distinction" involves systematization. The text does not use the phrase "categorically distinct." | #5 (systematizing five N-items into a doctrinal claim) | I002 (exists -- "Also In" update) |
| I2 | The Decalogue's unique delivery mode (God's direct voice), unique authorship (God's finger), unique medium (stone), unique repository (inside the ark), unique boundary ("he added no more"), and unique naming conventions ("the testimony," "his covenant") establish it as a higher-authority law code than the mediated legislation. | I-A | E001-E009, E098-E114 (all the factual observations about the Decalogue's unique features). N001, N002, N011-N015 (the necessary implications from those facts). The Decalogue has seven markers that no other legislation shares. | The claim that these features establish "higher authority" is a step of reasoning beyond the textual observations. The text states the features but does not explicitly state that one law code has "higher authority" than another. Both are given by God; the distinction is in the mode of delivery and medium. The concept of a hierarchy between law codes must be inferred from the data. An Abolished scholar could argue that all laws from God have equal authority regardless of delivery mode. | #5 (systematizing); #1 (adding "higher authority" concept) | I015 (new) |
| I3 | Paul's statement that the law was given "in the hand of a mediator" (Gal 3:19) refers to the mediated legislation (mishpatim, ceremonial law) given through Moses, not to the Decalogue which God spoke directly. | I-B | FOR: E001 (God spoke the Decalogue directly), E098 (people requested mediation afterward), E109 (Paul's mediator statement), N001 (two delivery modes). The Decalogue was spoken by God's own voice before any mediator was requested. Paul's mediator reference fits the post-mediation-request legislation. AGAINST: E109 (Gal 3:19 says "the law" without specifying which category). E058 (Gal 3:19 context discusses "the law" broadly). Acts 7:38, 53 and Heb 2:2 describe the entire Sinai event involving angelic mediation. The Abolished position may read "the law" as inclusive of all Sinai legislation, including the Decalogue (since even the Decalogue was ultimately delivered through Moses to the people per Deu 5:5). | Paul uses "the law" (ho nomos) in Gal 3:19 without specifying the referent as moral or ceremonial. Assigning the mediator reference to one category requires choosing between readings. The Continues position chooses to apply it to the mediated legislation only; the Abolished position may apply it to all Sinai law. Both readings require interpretive judgment beyond what the verse specifies. | #2 (choosing between readings of which law Paul means); #5 (systematizing with the Exodus narrative) | I016 (new) |
| I4 | The five textual distinctions between the Decalogue and other laws demonstrate that the cessation passages (which use dogma [G1378] for what was abolished) apply to the mediated legislation, not to the Decalogue. | I-A | N1-N7 (all five dimensions of distinction). E053/E054 from law-01 (Eph 2:15 and Col 2:14 use dogma for what was abolished). The Decalogue has a completely different profile from the legislation described by dogma: different delivery, different author, different medium, different repository, different name. The cessation vocabulary (dogma) is never applied to the Decalogue. | This claim connects the law-03 distinctions with the law-01 word study finding about dogma. All components are in the E/N tables across both studies. The systematization combines the narrative distinctions with the Greek vocabulary observations. It extends beyond any single verse's statement. | #5 (systematizing cross-study E/N items); #4a (SIS: the Decalogue's profile -- established by multiple E-items -- governs the reading of which law the cessation passages address) | I017 (new) |
| I5 | The textual distinctions between the Decalogue and other legislation are merely narrative details about how different laws were delivered. They do not establish two separate law codes with different fates. All Sinai legislation was one unified "law of Moses" that was fulfilled and set aside at the cross. | I-B | FOR: E090 from law-02 (Jhn 1:17: "the law was given by Moses" -- attributes all law to Moses). E058 (Gal 3:19: "the law...added till the seed should come" -- temporal limit). E048 (2 Cor 3:7: "written and engraven in stones...done away" -- cessation language near a Decalogue reference). AGAINST: E001-E009, E098-E114, N001-N007, N011-N015 (the entire body of textual distinctions this study documents). E010, E011 from law-01 (the law is holy, just, good, spiritual -- present tense). E021, E022 from law-01 (not one jot/tittle shall pass). E025 from law-01 (faith establishes the law). The claim that the distinctions are "merely narrative details" requires overriding the text's explicit and repeated emphasis on these distinctions across multiple authors and centuries. | This claim has E/N items on both sides. The AGAINST side has the five-dimensional distinction pattern documented across the Exodus narrative, Deuteronomy, Leviticus, Nehemiah, Hebrews, and Paul. The FOR side has passages where "the law" is used broadly without specifying categories. The claim requires the distinctions (five dimensions, maintained by multiple authors) to be incidental rather than structurally significant. | #2 (choosing to read the distinctions as incidental); #1 (adding the concept that "one law code" overrides the textual distinctions) | I018 (new) |
| I6 | The Sabbath commandment's placement within the Decalogue (the directly-spoken, God-written, stone-engraved, inside-the-ark law) distinguishes it from the ceremonial sabbaths of Leviticus 23, which were given through Moses as mediated legislation. | I-A | E086 (Exo 20:8-11: the Sabbath commandment is part of the Decalogue). E001 (God spoke the Decalogue directly). E003 (written by God's finger). E007 (placed inside the ark). N001 (two delivery modes). The fourth commandment shares all the Decalogue's unique features. The Levitical feast sabbaths (Lev 23) were given through Moses on the mountain (mediated). | The claim that the Sabbath's Decalogue placement "distinguishes it from ceremonial sabbaths" is a step of systematization. The text places the Sabbath in the Decalogue (E086) and the feast days in the Levitical legislation (given through Moses). The claim combines these two observations. An Abolished scholar could argue that the seventh-day Sabbath is also ceremonial despite its Decalogue placement. | #5 (systematizing the Sabbath's Decalogue placement with the five-dimensional distinction) | I019 (new) |
| I7 | The narrative distinction between the Decalogue and other laws has no implications for the ongoing authority of either category. Both are equally subject to the new covenant change. The delivery mode is historically interesting but theologically irrelevant. | I-D | AGAINST: N001-N007, N011-N015 (the entire pattern of distinctions maintained by multiple authors over centuries). N005/N013 (Moses explicitly draws the distinction in Deu 4:13-14). E021 from law-01 (Jesus: not one jot shall pass from the law). E025 from law-01 (faith establishes the law). E038-E040 from law-01 (new covenant writes "my law" on hearts). E010-E011 from law-01 (the law is holy, just, good, spiritual). The claim that these distinctions are "theologically irrelevant" requires dismissing the narrative emphasis multiple authors place on them and overriding the statements that the law continues. | This claim imports the concept of "theological irrelevance" -- a judgment the text does not make. The text does not state the distinctions are irrelevant; it consistently emphasizes them. Dismissing the distinctions as irrelevant requires adding a framework the text does not provide and overriding the repeated emphasis. | #1 (adding "theologically irrelevant" to what the text emphasizes); #3 (applying an external framework of unified-law theology) | I020 (new) |
| I8 | The Bible does not need to use the specific labels "moral," "ceremonial," and "civil" for the distinction to exist, because the narrative structure itself encodes the categories through five dimensions of differential treatment: (1) delivery mode -- God spoke the Decalogue directly to the assembly; all other laws came through Moses as mediator (N001); (2) authorship -- God wrote the Decalogue with His own finger; Moses wrote the additional laws (N011); (3) repository -- tablets inside the ark; book beside the ark (N002); (4) naming conventions -- "the testimony," "his covenant, even ten commandments" vs. "the book of the covenant," "this book of the law" (N012); (5) boundary marker -- "he added no more" (N014). The objection that "the text never uses the terms moral/ceremonial/civil" is answered by the structural encoding: the text distinguishes the categories by treatment even without using those specific labels. | I-A | N001 (two delivery modes), N002 (two repositories), N011 (two authorships), N012 (two naming conventions), N013 (Moses' explicit distinction in Deu 4:13-14), N014 ("he added no more" boundary), N015 (multi-author consistency). All five dimensions are documented in the N-tier of this study. The Decalogue receives consistently different treatment from all subsequent legislation across every dimension. No single verse states the label "moral law," but the structural encoding across five dimensions performs the same distinguishing function. | This claim systematizes the five N-tier observations into a response to the specific objection that the text never uses the labels "moral/ceremonial/civil." All components are in the N tables. The step beyond what the text states is framing the five-dimensional distinction as a "structural encoding" that substitutes for explicit labeling -- the text shows the distinction without naming it, and the claim that showing equals naming requires a step of reasoning. | #5 (systematizing five N-items into a response to a specific objection) | I053 (new) |
| I9 | Historical evidence corroborates the textual distinction between the Decalogue and the rest of the law: the Decalogue was recited daily in synagogue liturgy alongside the Shema (Deu 6:4-9) until the early centuries CE. The Mishnah (Tamid 5:1) records this practice. The Nash Papyrus (2nd century BCE) pairs the Decalogue with the Shema on a single manuscript, confirming the liturgical pairing. Rabbinic sources indicate the practice was discontinued specifically because early Christians (the minim) were arguing that only the Decalogue was uniquely binding -- the rabbis removed the Decalogue recitation to counter the claim that it had special authority above other laws. This historical evidence confirms that the distinction between the Decalogue and the rest of the law was recognized in early Jewish-Christian tradition, and that the Decalogue's unique status was sufficiently established that it had to be actively suppressed for polemical reasons. | I-C | E001-E009 (the textual features of the Decalogue: direct speech, God's finger, stone, inside the ark, "he added no more"). N001, N002, N011-N015 (the five-dimensional distinction). E260 (the Shema text, Deu 6:4-9). The Mishnah Tamid 5:1 records that the Ten Commandments were recited daily in the Temple service alongside the Shema. The Nash Papyrus (2nd century BCE Egyptian manuscript) contains the Decalogue and the Shema together. The Jerusalem Talmud (Berakhot 1:5) records the reason for discontinuation: "because of the claim of the minim" -- i.e., to counter the early Christian argument that the Decalogue had special binding authority. | This is I-C (Compatible External) because the evidence comes from outside the biblical text: the Mishnah, the Nash Papyrus, and the Jerusalem Talmud are not Scripture. The historical evidence does not contradict any E/N item -- it corroborates the textual distinction the Bible itself encodes. The source is external (rabbinic literature, archaeological manuscript); the direction is compatible (confirms, does not override, the E/N items). | #3 (external historical/archaeological evidence not found in Scripture); #5 (systematizing external data with biblical E/N items) | I054 (new) |

### I-B Resolution: I3 -- Galatians 3:19 "Mediator" Refers to Mediated Legislation Only

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (mediator = mediated legislation only): E001 (God spoke the Decalogue directly), E098 (people requested mediation afterward -- the mediation happened AFTER the Decalogue), E099 (God approved the request), E100 (God then gave additional laws through Moses), N001 (two delivery modes), N006 ("he added no more" boundary). The chronological sequence is clear: Decalogue first (direct), then mediation request, then remaining laws (mediated).
- AGAINST (mediator = all Sinai law including Decalogue): E109 (Gal 3:19 says "the law" without specifying), E058 (Gal 3:19 context discusses "the law" broadly), E113 (Deu 5:5 places Moses "between" even during the Decalogue), E115/E116/E117 (Acts 7:38, 53; Heb 2:2 reference angels and Moses in the broader Sinai event).

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E001 | Plain | Direct statement: "God spake all these words." |
| E098 | Plain | Direct narrative: "Speak thou with us...let not God speak with us." |
| E099 | Plain | Direct divine speech: "They have well said." |
| E100 | Plain | Direct divine speech: "I will speak unto thee all the commandments, statutes, and judgments." |
| N001 | Plain | Observable pattern from multiple Plain E-items. |
| N006 | Plain | "He added no more" -- stated in the text. |
| E109 | Ambiguous | "The law" (ho nomos) is unspecified as to which category. |
| E058 | Ambiguous | Same Galatians 3 context; referent unspecified. |
| E113 | Contextually Clear | Deu 5:5 places Moses "between," but 5:4 states God spoke "face to face." The parenthetical explains Moses' position without negating the direct speech. |
| E115-E117 | Contextually Clear | Acts 7:38, 53 and Heb 2:2 describe the Sinai event broadly. These passages do not specifically distinguish the Decalogue from the subsequent legislation; they describe the event as a whole. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR side: Multiple Plain statements (E001, E098, E099, E100, N001, N006) -- 6 items at Plain level. The chronological sequence in the narrative is unambiguous: God spoke first, then the people requested mediation, then the remaining laws were given through Moses.
AGAINST side: Two Ambiguous (E109, E058) and three Contextually Clear items (E113, E115-E117).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements establish the narrative sequence: the Decalogue was delivered before any mediator was requested. The mediator arrangement was instituted after the Decalogue (E098, E099). Paul's reference to "the hand of a mediator" (E109, Ambiguous) is most consistently read as referring to the legislation that actually came through a mediator -- the post-request legislation. Deu 5:5 (E113, Contextually Clear) describes Moses' position during the Decalogue delivery but does not negate the direct speech (5:4). The broader Sinai descriptions (Acts 7, Heb 2) describe the event as a whole without distinguishing the two stages.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate**
The FOR side has substantially more Plain evidence. The narrative sequence (Decalogue first, then mediation request, then remaining laws) is unambiguous. The AGAINST side relies on Ambiguous passages (unspecified "the law" in Galatians) and Contextually Clear passages (broader event descriptions). The resolution is Moderate rather than Strong because Acts 7:38, 53 and Heb 2:2 describe Moses receiving "the lively oracles" and "the law by the disposition of angels" without distinguishing stages, which requires contextual analysis.

---

### I-B Resolution: I5 -- The Textual Distinctions Are Merely Narrative Details

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (distinctions are incidental): E090 (Jhn 1:17: "the law was given by Moses"), E058 (Gal 3:19: "the law...added till the seed"), E048 (2 Cor 3:7: "written and engraven in stones...done away").
- AGAINST (distinctions are structurally significant): E001-E009 (seven Decalogue markers), E098-E114 (mediation narrative), N001-N007/N011-N015 (five dimensions of distinction maintained across authors). E010, E011 from law-01 (law is holy, just, good, spiritual). E021, E022 from law-01 (not one jot shall pass). E025 from law-01 (faith establishes the law). E038-E040 from law-01 (new covenant writes same law on hearts).

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E090 | Contextually Clear | "The law was given by Moses" -- addresses the mode of formal delivery, not the authorship question (God vs. Moses). |
| E058 | Ambiguous | "The law" referent is unspecified. |
| E048 | Contextually Clear | "Done away" applies grammatically to "the glory of his countenance." Requires contextual analysis. |
| E001-E009 | Plain | Direct quotations or close paraphrases of narrative facts. |
| E098-E114 | Plain | Direct quotations or close paraphrases. |
| N001-N007, N011-N015 | Plain | Observable patterns from Plain E-items. |
| E010-E011 (law-01) | Plain | Direct declarative statements. |
| E021-E022 (law-01) | Plain | Jesus' direct speech. |
| E025 (law-01) | Plain | Paul's declarative statement with strongest denial formula. |
| E038-E040 (law-01) | Plain | Direct divine speech from God/NT quotation. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: One Ambiguous (E058) + two Contextually Clear (E090, E048) = 3 items.
AGAINST: Approximately 25+ Plain items across the five dimensions of distinction, plus Plain continuation statements from law-01.
The AGAINST side dominates.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements from multiple authors maintaining the same five-dimensional distinction pattern govern the reading of the Ambiguous/Contextually Clear passages. The distinction pattern is not a single verse's claim but a sustained narrative feature across Exodus, Deuteronomy, Leviticus, Nehemiah, Hebrews, and Paul. The claim that these are "merely narrative details" must overcome the breadth and consistency of the pattern. The Ambiguous passages (unspecified "the law" in Galatians) do not address the distinction question; they simply use "the law" broadly. The Contextually Clear passage (2 Cor 3:7) requires analysis of the grammatical subject of "done away."

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong (against I5)**
The claim that the five textual distinctions are "merely narrative details" with no significance has only Ambiguous and Contextually Clear support. The opposing evidence is overwhelmingly Plain, consistent across multiple authors and centuries, and maintained by the text's own emphasis (Moses explicitly draws the distinction in Deu 4:13-14). I5 is weakly supported.

### Positional Classification Summary

**E-items:**
- **Continues:** E10-E18, E34, E37 / E086, E098-E106, E118 (delivery mode pivot, divine sanction of distinction, mediated delivery, Deu 4:13-14 distinction, different introductory formula, different authorships, third delivery mode, Nehemiah retrospective, medium distinction, Sabbath grounded in creation) = 11 items
- **Abolished:** 0 items (no verse in this study uses cessation vocabulary applied to the Decalogue; E33/E048 reclassified to Neutral via Gate analysis)
- **Neutral:** E1-E9, E19-E33, E35-E36, E38 / E001-E009, E048, E051, E107-E117, E119-E120, E260 = 27 items

**N-items:**
- **Continues:** N3-N7 / N011-N015 (two authorships, two naming conventions, Moses' explicit distinction, "he added no more" boundary, two-mode distinction maintained across authors/centuries) = 5 items
- **Abolished:** 0
- **Neutral:** N1-N2, N8 / N001, N002, N005 = 3 items

**I-items:**
- **I-A Continues:** I1 / I002 (categorical distinction), I2 / I015 (higher-authority inference), I4 / I017 (cessation = mediated law), I6 / I019 (Sabbath Decalogue placement), I8 / I053 (structural encoding responds to labeling objection) = 5 items
- **I-B (both sides):** I3 / I016 (Gal 3:19 mediator referent -- resolved Moderate toward Continues), I5 / I018 (distinctions are incidental -- resolved Strong against) = 2 items
- **I-C Continues:** I9 / I054 (historical evidence: Decalogue recited with Shema in synagogue liturgy, discontinued due to minim argument) = 1 item
- **I-D Abolished:** I7 / I020 (distinctions are theologically irrelevant) = 1 item

---

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases actual verse text. Checked.
- Each is the plain meaning of the words in the verse. Checked.
- E-items report what the text SAYS, not what a position infers. Checked.
- No items were misclassified between E and I tiers.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- E37/E086 (Continues): Subject is the Sabbath commandment within the Decalogue, grounded in creation. All four gates pass. Verified.
- E10-E18, E34 / E098-E106, E118 (Continues): These items evidence a textual distinction between the Decalogue and subsequent legislation (delivery mode pivot, divine sanction, mediated delivery, Deu 4:13-14 explicit distinction, different introductory formula, different authorships, third delivery mode, Nehemiah retrospective, medium distinction). The Continues position argues the Bible distinguishes moral from ceremonial/civil law; the Abolished position denies any such distinction. Evidence of a distinction supports Continues. Verified.
- E33/E048 (Neutral): "Done away" applies grammatically to "the glory," not the law. Gate 1 analysis shows the referent of cessation language is the glory/ministration, not the stone tablets. Reclassified to Neutral. Verified.
- Remaining E-items are Neutral because they report factual observations (delivery modes, authorship, repository, naming conventions) that do not specifically evidence a distinction between law categories. Verified.
- No E-item is classified Abolished because no verse in this study applies cessation vocabulary unambiguously to the Decalogue itself.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- N1/N001: Two delivery modes -- unavoidable from the cited E-items. Multiple authors confirm. Verified.
- N2/N002: Two repositories -- unavoidable from E7, E8, E9. Verified.
- N3/N011: Two authorships -- unavoidable from E3, E4, E9, E15. Verified.
- N4/N012: Two naming conventions -- observable in the text. Verified.
- N5/N013: Moses' explicit distinction in Deu 4:13-14 -- stated in the text. Verified.
- N6/N014: "He added no more" boundary -- stated in the text. Verified.
- N7/N015: Multi-author maintenance of distinction -- observable across texts. Verified.
- N8/N005: Replacement tablets have same content -- stated in the text. Verified.
- All N-items pass the three N-tier tests (universal agreement, no interpretation required, zero added concepts). Verified.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
- I1/I002 (I-A): Components (N001, N002, N011-N015) all in N table. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A.
- I2/I015 (I-A): Components (E001-E009, N items) all in E/N tables. "Higher authority" is added. Still text-derived since all data points are from E/N, but the concept of hierarchy is systematized. Confirmed I-A (criterion #5 + minor #1 for the "higher authority" label).
- I3/I016 (I-B): Both sides have E/N items. Confirmed I-B.
- I4/I017 (I-A): Components (N items + law-01 E053/E054) all in E/N tables. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A.
- I5/I018 (I-B): Both sides have E/N items. Confirmed I-B.
- I6/I019 (I-A): Components (E086, E001, E003, E007, N001) all in E/N tables. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A.
- I7/I020 (I-D): "Theologically irrelevant" is not in any E/N item. External. Overrides N001-N015 by dismissing them. Confirmed I-D.
- I8/I053 (I-A): Components (N001, N002, N011-N015) all in N table. Text-derived. The claim frames these as a "structural encoding" responding to a specific objection. Confirmed I-A (criterion #5 -- systematizing five N-items into a response framework).
- I9/I054 (I-C): Components include Mishnah Tamid 5:1, Nash Papyrus, Jerusalem Talmud -- all external to Scripture. NOT in E/N tables. External. Does not override any E/N statement -- corroborates the distinction. Confirmed I-C.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
- I1/I002: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I2/I015: Does not require E/N reinterpretation, but adds "higher authority." Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I3/I016: Requires choosing which law Paul means in Gal 3:19. Confirmed conflicts on one reading (I-B).
- I4/I017: Does not require E/N reinterpretation. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I5/I018: Requires the five dimensions of distinction to be "merely incidental." This requires the repeated textual emphasis to mean less than it appears. Confirmed conflicts (I-B).
- I6/I019: Does not require E/N reinterpretation. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I7/I020: Requires all N-items about the distinctions to be "irrelevant." Overrides. Confirmed (I-D).
- I8/I053: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I9/I054: Does not override any E/N statement. Confirmed compatible (I-C).

**Step E: Run consistency checks.**
- I1/I002 (I-A): Requires #5 only. Confirmed.
- I2/I015 (I-A): Requires #5 + minor #1. Noted.
- I3/I016 (I-B): E/N items on both sides. Confirmed.
- I4/I017 (I-A): Requires #5 + #4a. The SIS connection between the narrative distinctions and the dogma word study is verified by shared subject matter (different types of law). Confirmed.
- I5/I018 (I-B): E/N items on both sides. Confirmed.
- I6/I019 (I-A): Requires #5 only. Confirmed.
- I7/I020 (I-D): Overrides N001-N015. Confirmed.
- I8/I053 (I-A): Requires #5 only. Confirmed.
- I9/I054 (I-C): External source. Overrides nothing. Confirmed.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- I3/I016: Full I-B resolution documented above. Confirmed.
- I4/I017: The connection between the narrative distinctions (law-03) and the dogma word study (law-01) is through shared subject: both address the question of which laws are in which category. The law-03 narrative shows five dimensions of distinction; law-01 shows that the cessation vocabulary uses dogma (not applied to the Decalogue). Connection verified through shared subject matter. #4a applies. Confirmed.
- I5/I018: Full I-B resolution documented above. Confirmed.

### What CAN Be Said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies)

1. God spoke the Ten Commandments directly to the assembled people with His own voice; all other laws came through Moses as mediator (E001, E002, E098-E100, N001).
2. The people, after hearing God's voice speak the Decalogue, requested Moses to mediate all subsequent communication; God approved this arrangement (E098, E099).
3. God then told Moses to remain and receive "all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments" to teach the people (E100).
4. After the Decalogue, "he added no more" -- God ceased speaking directly to the assembly (E002, N006/N014).
5. Moses explicitly distinguished "his covenant, even ten commandments" from "statutes and judgments" in consecutive verses (Deu 4:13-14; E101, N005/N013).
6. God wrote the Decalogue with His own finger; Moses wrote the book of the law (E003, E004, E009, E103, E104; N003/N011).
7. The Decalogue tablets were placed inside the ark; the book of the law was placed beside the ark (E007, E008, E009, E110; N002).
8. The tablets are called "the testimony," "tables of the covenant," "his covenant, even ten commandments"; Moses' document is called "the book of the covenant," "this book of the law" (E005, E006, E009, E015, E024, E111; N004/N012).
9. The two-mode distinction (direct vs. mediated) is maintained by multiple biblical authors across centuries: Moses, the Levitical closing, the Nehemiah retrospective, the Hebrews author, and Paul (N007/N015).
10. The replacement tablets contain the same content as the originals (N008/N005).
11. The Sabbath commandment is part of the Decalogue (spoken directly by God, written by God's finger, placed inside the ark) and grounds itself in creation (E086).
12. Paul references the mediation arrangement and contrasts it with God acting directly: "a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one" (E109).
13. The Nehemiah retrospective maintains the distinction: God "spakest with them from heaven" (direct) and "commandedst them...by the hand of Moses" (mediated) (E106).
14. "There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone" -- confirmed by both 1 Kings 8:9 and 2 Chronicles 5:10 (E008, E110).
15. The Bible does not use the labels "moral," "ceremonial," or "civil," but the narrative structure itself encodes the distinction through five dimensions of differential treatment (delivery mode, authorship, repository, naming conventions, boundary marker) -- the categories are shown, not labeled (I8/I053: I-A, all components from N-tier).

### What CANNOT Be Said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture)

1. Scripture does not explicitly state that the textual distinctions between the Decalogue and other laws establish a "hierarchy of authority" among the laws. The text presents the distinctions; the concept of relative authority is inferred (I2/I015).
2. Scripture does not explicitly state whether "the law" in Galatians 3:19 ("ordained...in the hand of a mediator") refers to the Decalogue, the mediated legislation, or all Sinai law. The referent is unspecified (I3/I016).
3. Scripture does not explicitly state that the five-dimensional distinction means the Decalogue continues while the mediated law ceases. The text presents the distinctions; the implications for continuity are inferred from combining these distinctions with the cessation-vocabulary findings from law-01 (I4/I017).
4. Scripture does not explicitly state whether the delivery mode, authorship, medium, and repository differences are "incidental" or "structurally significant." The repeated emphasis across authors suggests significance, but the text does not use the word "significant" (I5/I018 addresses this).
5. Scripture does not explicitly state the purpose of the two repositories. The tablets inside the ark and the book beside the ark are a textual fact (N002); whether this reflects a difference in authority, permanence, or function is inferred.
6. Neither the Continues position nor the Abolished position can claim the text explicitly states its full framework regarding the distinction's implications. The Continues position systematizes the five distinctions into a doctrine of categorical distinction (I-A inferences). The Abolished position's claim that the distinctions are "theologically irrelevant" (I7/I020) requires dismissing the repeated textual emphasis.
7. Scripture does not use the specific labels "moral," "ceremonial," or "civil." The distinction is encoded structurally through differential treatment, not through explicit labeling. The absence of the labels does not negate the structural distinction (I8/I053), but the labels themselves are theological vocabulary imposed on a textual pattern.
8. The historical evidence that the Decalogue was recited alongside the Shema in synagogue liturgy (Mishnah Tamid 5:1; Nash Papyrus) and that this practice was discontinued due to the minim argument is external to Scripture (I9/I054, I-C). It corroborates the textual distinction but cannot be cited as what "the Bible says."

## Analysis

### The Narrative Sequence of Exodus 19-31

The Exodus narrative presents a clear sequential structure:

**Stage 1 (Exo 19:16-20:17): God speaks the Decalogue directly.** God descends in a theophany of fire, smoke, earthquake, and trumpet. "God spake all these words" (20:1). The people hear God's voice. The content is the Ten Commandments (20:2-17).

**Transition (Exo 20:18-21): The people request mediation.** "Speak thou with us...but let not God speak with us" (20:19). Moses draws near to God; the people stand afar off.

**Stage 2a (Exo 20:22-23:33): God gives the mishpatim through Moses.** "The LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say" (20:22). "Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them" (21:1). The content is civil, judicial, and social regulations.

**Stage 2b (Exo 25-31): God gives sanctuary/ceremonial instructions through Moses.** "The LORD spake unto Moses, saying" (25:1). The content is tabernacle construction, priestly vestments, offerings, and worship procedures.

**The tablets given (Exo 31:18): "Written with the finger of God."** The physical tablets of the Decalogue are given to Moses after all other instructions are completed.

This structure shows three distinct categories of legislation with distinct delivery modes: (1) the Decalogue, spoken directly by God to the people; (2) the mishpatim, given through Moses to the people; (3) the sanctuary/ceremonial laws, given to Moses alone on the mountain.

### The Deuteronomy 4:13-14 Distinction

Moses explicitly distinguishes two categories in consecutive verses:
- Verse 13: "He declared unto you **his covenant, even ten commandments**; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone."
- Verse 14: "And the LORD commanded **me** at that time to teach you **statutes and judgments**."

The subject of v.13 is God declaring directly. The subject of v.14 is God commanding Moses to teach. The content of v.13 is "his covenant, even ten commandments." The content of v.14 is "statutes and judgments." The possessive pronoun "his" (covenant) identifies the Decalogue as God's own. The pronoun "me" identifies Moses as the agent for the additional laws.

### Deuteronomy 5:22 -- "He Added No More"

The phrase "he added no more" (lo yasaph) marks a definitive boundary. After the Decalogue, God stopped speaking directly to the assembly. The phrase serves as a textual demarcation between what God spoke directly and what came through mediation. Everything after this boundary point was delivered through Moses.

### The Two Repositories

The spatial distinction is consistent and confirmed by multiple texts:
- Tablets: INSIDE the ark (Exo 25:16, 21; 40:20; Deu 10:2, 5)
- Book: BESIDE the ark (Deu 31:26)
- Exclusive confirmation: "Nothing in the ark save the two tables" (1Ki 8:9; 2Ch 5:10)

The Decalogue occupies the most sacred space in the entire tabernacle. The book of the law occupies a separate, adjacent space.

### The Mediator Concept: Galatians 3:19-20

Paul states the law was given "in the hand of a mediator" and then contrasts: "a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one." This contrast is consistent with the Exodus narrative: the mediated legislation came through Moses (a go-between), while the Decalogue came from God directly (God is one -- He acted alone in speaking the Ten Commandments).

The referent of "the law" in Galatians 3:19 is not specified as either the moral law or the ceremonial system. This is an I-B item (I3/I016) with a Moderate resolution toward the Continues reading.

### The Multi-Author Consistency

The two-mode distinction is not a single author's claim. It appears in:
- **Exodus** (narrative: chapters 19-31)
- **Deuteronomy** (Moses' retrospective: chapters 4-5, 9-10, 31)
- **Leviticus** (closing formula: 26:46)
- **Nehemiah** (Levites' prayer: 9:13-14)
- **Hebrews** (12:18-21)
- **Galatians** (3:19-20)
- **Acts** (7:38, 53)

This cross-author, cross-century consistency indicates a recognized feature of the Sinai narrative, not an incidental detail in one account.

## Word Studies

### Key Findings

**eduth (H5715):** Used exclusively for the Decalogue tablets in the Pentateuch ("tables of testimony," "the testimony," "ark of the testimony"). Never applied to the mishpatim or the book of the law in this context.

**berith (H1285):** Applied to both documents but with distinguishing qualifiers: "his covenant, even ten commandments" (Deu 4:13) vs. "the book of the covenant" (Exo 24:7). The possessive "his" identifies the Decalogue.

**mishpat (H4941):** Introduces the civil/judicial laws (Exo 21:1) and is one of the terms Moses explicitly separates from the Decalogue (Deu 4:14).

**towrah (H8451):** Broad semantic range. In Deu 31:9, 24, 26, refers to the book Moses wrote. Context determines the referent.

**etsba (H676):** "Finger of God" used only for the Decalogue writing and one plague reference. Unique authorship marker.

**mesites (G3316):** NT term for mediator. Paul uses it in Gal 3:19-20 for the law given through a mediator, contrasting with God acting alone.

## Conclusion

This study examined 38 explicit statements, 8 necessary implications, and 9 inferences. 11 of 38 E-items support Continues -- 1 uses law-continuation vocabulary (E086: Sabbath grounded in creation) and 10 evidence a categorical distinction between law types (different delivery modes, authorship, repositories, naming conventions, boundary markers, multi-author consistency). 27 E-items are Neutral. Zero E-items use cessation vocabulary applied to the Decalogue.

5 of 8 N-items support Continues -- documenting the five dimensions of distinction (delivery mode, authorship, repository, naming conventions, boundary marker), the multi-author consistency, and Moses' explicit distinction in Deu 4:13-14. 3 N-items are Neutral.

5 I-A inferences systematize the textual data toward the Continues position (categorical distinction, cessation-vocabulary connection, Sabbath placement, structural encoding responding to the labeling objection). 2 I-B inferences address competing readings: I3 (Gal 3:19 mediator referent, resolved Moderate toward Continues) and I5 (distinctions are incidental, resolved Strong against the Abolished reading). 1 I-C inference (historical evidence: Decalogue recited alongside Shema in synagogue liturgy until discontinued due to the minim argument) corroborates the textual distinction from an external source. 1 I-D inference (distinctions are theologically irrelevant) requires dismissing the repeated emphasis multiple authors place on the distinctions.

The objection that the text never uses the specific labels "moral," "ceremonial," or "civil" is addressed by the five-dimensional structural encoding: the text distinguishes the Decalogue from other legislation through differential treatment (delivery mode, authorship, repository, naming conventions, boundary marker) even without using those specific labels (I8/I053). Historical evidence from outside Scripture -- the Mishnah (Tamid 5:1), the Nash Papyrus (2nd century BCE), and the Jerusalem Talmud (Berakhot 1:5) -- corroborates that the distinction between the Decalogue and other laws was recognized in early Jewish-Christian tradition. The Decalogue was recited daily alongside the Shema in synagogue liturgy, and this practice was discontinued specifically because early Christians argued the Decalogue was uniquely binding. This external evidence (I9/I054, I-C) does not override or replace the biblical textual evidence but independently confirms the pattern the text encodes.

The textual data is consistent: the Exodus-Deuteronomy narrative, the Levitical closing, the Nehemiah retrospective, and the NT references all maintain the same distinction pattern between the Decalogue and the subsequent legislation. The five dimensions of distinction -- delivery mode, authorship, repository, naming conventions, and the "he added no more" boundary -- converge to present the Decalogue as textually separate from the mediated legislation.
