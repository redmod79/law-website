## [H5715](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5715/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - eduth (עֵדוּת) -- "testimony"
**Original:** עֵדוּת
**Transliteration:** ʻêdûwth
**Pronunciation:** ay-dooth
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** Testimony, witness
**Occurrences:** 66 total in the KJV

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| of the testimony | 15 | 22.7% |
| the testimony | 13 | 19.7% |
| of testimony | 8 | 12.1% |
| thy testimonies | 3 | 4.5% |
| of witness | 4 | 6.1% |
| a testimony | 2 | 3.0% |

### Key Verses for This Study
- **Exodus 25:16** -- "And thou shalt put into the ark the **testimony** (eduth) which I shall give thee."
- **Exodus 25:21** -- "in the ark thou shalt put the **testimony** (eduth) that I shall give thee."
- **Exodus 31:18** -- "two tables of **testimony** (eduth), tables of stone, written with the finger of God"
- **Exodus 32:15** -- "the two tables of the **testimony** (eduth) were in his hand"
- **Exodus 34:29** -- "the two tables of **testimony** (eduth) in Moses' hand"
- **Exodus 40:20** -- "he took and put the **testimony** (eduth) into the ark"

### Significance for This Study
The word eduth is used exclusively for the stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments in the Exodus/tabernacle context. The "ark of the testimony," the "tabernacle of testimony," and the "tables of testimony" all use this word. It is never used in the Pentateuch for the "judgments" (mishpatim) or "statutes" (chuqqoth) given through Moses. This is one of the naming conventions that distinguishes the Decalogue from the other laws.

In the Psalms, eduth/edoth is used more broadly for God's testimonies/precepts (Psa 19:8; 78:5; 119 passim), but in the Pentateuchal narrative it refers specifically to the stone-tablet document.

## [H1285](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1285/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - berith (בְּרִית) -- "covenant"
**Original:** בְּרִית
**Transliteration:** bᵉrîyth
**Pronunciation:** ber-eeth
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** Compact (from the root meaning "to cut," referring to the cutting of a covenant by passing between pieces of flesh); confederacy, covenant, league
**Occurrences:** 317 total in the KJV

### Translations

| a covenant | 40 | 12.6% |
| the covenant | 27 | 8.5% |
| his covenant | 14 | 4.4% |
| a league | 11 | 3.5% |

### Key Verses for This Study
- **Deuteronomy 4:13** -- "And he declared unto you **his covenant** (berith), which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone."
- **Deuteronomy 9:9** -- "the tables of stone, even the tables of the **covenant** (berith) which the LORD made with you"
- **Deuteronomy 9:11** -- "the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the **covenant** (berith)"
- **Exodus 34:28** -- "he wrote upon the tables the words of the **covenant** (berith), the ten commandments"
- **Exodus 24:7** -- "the book of the **covenant** (berith)"
- **Exodus 24:8** -- "the blood of the **covenant** (berith)"

### Significance for This Study
Berith is used for BOTH the stone tablets ("his covenant, even ten commandments" -- Deu 4:13; "tables of the covenant" -- Deu 9:9,11) AND the document Moses wrote ("book of the covenant" -- Exo 24:7). The distinction is not in the word berith itself but in the qualifying phrases: "his covenant" (God's = Decalogue) vs. "book of the covenant" (Moses' written document). The "tables of the covenant" and the "book of the covenant" are two different physical objects.

## [H4941](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4941/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - mishpat (מִשְׁפָּט) -- "judgment"
**Original:** מִשְׁפָּט
**Transliteration:** mishpâṭ
**Pronunciation:** mish-pawt
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Definition:** Verdict (favorable or unfavorable), sentence, formal decree (human or divine), including the act, place, suit, crime, and penalty; abstractly justice, right, privilege, style
**Occurrences:** 448 total in the KJV

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |

| my judgments | 23 | 5.1% |
| of judgment | 21 | 4.7% |
| after the manner | 12 | 2.7% |
| right | 7 | 1.6% |

### Key Verses for This Study
- **Exodus 21:1** -- "Now these are the **judgments** (mishpatim) which thou shalt set before them."
- **Exodus 24:3** -- "Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the **judgments** (mishpatim)"
- **Deuteronomy 4:1** -- "hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the **judgments** (mishpatim)"
- **Deuteronomy 4:14** -- "the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and **judgments** (mishpatim)"
- **Deuteronomy 5:31** -- "I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the **judgments** (mishpatim)"
- **Leviticus 26:46** -- "These are the statutes and **judgments** (mishpatim) and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses."
- **Nehemiah 9:13** -- "gavest them right **judgments** (mishpatim), and true laws, good statutes and commandments"

### Significance for This Study
Mishpat/mishpatim is the term used in Exodus 21:1 to introduce the civil/judicial laws given AFTER the Decalogue, through Moses as mediator. In Deu 4:14, Moses explicitly separates "statutes and judgments" (which God commanded Moses to teach) from "his covenant, even ten commandments" (which God declared directly, v.13). The mishpatim are the content of chapters 21-23, the "book of the covenant."

## [H2706](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2706/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - choq (חֹק) -- "statute/decree"
**Original:** חֹק
**Transliteration:** chôq
**Pronunciation:** khoke
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Definition:** Enactment; appointment (of time, space, quantity, labor or usage); appointed, commandment, decree, law, ordinance, statute
**Occurrences:** 134 total in the KJV

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| the statutes | 14 | 10.4% |
| thy statutes | 14 | 10.4% |
| statutes | 13 | 9.7% |
| a statute | 7 | 5.2% |
| his statutes | 7 | 5.2% |

### Key Verses for This Study
- **Deuteronomy 4:1** -- "hearken, O Israel, unto the **statutes** (chuqqim) and unto the judgments"
- **Deuteronomy 4:5** -- "I have taught you **statutes** (chuqqim) and judgments"
- **Deuteronomy 4:14** -- "the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you **statutes** (chuqqim) and judgments"

- **Deuteronomy 5:31** -- "the commandments, and the **statutes** (chuqqim), and the judgments"
- **Leviticus 26:46** -- "the **statutes** (chuqqim) and judgments and laws"
- **Nehemiah 9:13-14** -- "good **statutes** (chuqqim) and commandments"

### Significance for This Study
Choq/chuqqim (statutes) appears alongside mishpat/mishpatim (judgments) as a category of law that Moses was commanded to teach (Deu 4:14; 5:31). Both terms are distinguished from "his covenant, even ten commandments" (Deu 4:13). The statutes include ceremonial regulations (feast days, offerings, ritual purity) as well as civil ordinances.

## [H8451](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8451/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - towrah (תּוֹרָה) -- "law/torah"
**Original:** תּוֹרָה
**Transliteration:** tôwrâh
**Pronunciation:** to-raw
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** Precept or statute, especially the Decalogue or Pentateuch; law
**Occurrences:** 244 total in the KJV

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| the law | 60 | 24.6% |
| of the law | 28 | 11.5% |
| law | 24 | 9.8% |
| thy law | 20 | 8.2% |
| in the law | 19 | 7.8% |

### Key Verses for This Study
- **Exodus 24:12** -- "I will give thee tables of stone, and a **law** (towrah), and commandments which I have written"
- **Deuteronomy 4:8** -- "what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this **law** (towrah)"
- **Deuteronomy 4:44** -- "this is the **law** (towrah) which Moses set before the children of Israel"
- **Deuteronomy 31:9** -- "Moses wrote this **law** (towrah), and delivered it unto the priests"
- **Deuteronomy 31:24** -- "when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this **law** (towrah) in a book"
- **Deuteronomy 31:26** -- "Take this book of the **law** (towrah), and put it in the side of the ark"
- **Deuteronomy 33:4** -- "Moses commanded us a **law** (towrah), even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob"
- **Hosea 8:12** -- "I have written to him the great things of my **law** (towrah)"

### Significance for This Study
Towrah has a broad semantic range. The BLB lexicon notes it can refer to "the Decalogue or Pentateuch." In context:
- In Deu 31:9,24,26, "this law" (towrah) refers to the book Moses wrote and placed BESIDE the ark -- not the stone tablets (which were INSIDE).
- In Deu 33:4, "Moses commanded us a law" -- attributed to Moses, not directly to God.
- In Exo 24:12, "a law (towrah) and commandments which I have written" -- God is the writer; this may refer to the stone tablets.
- The word towrah by itself does not specify which category of law; context determines the referent.

## [H676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h676/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - etsba (אֶצְבַּע) -- "finger"
**Original:** אֶצְבַּע
**Transliteration:** ʼetsbaʻ
**Pronunciation:** ets-bah
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** Finger; by analogy, toe
**Occurrences:** 34 total in the KJV

### Key Verses for This Study
- **Exodus 8:19** (H8:15 in Hebrew) -- "the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the **finger** (etsba) of God"
- **Exodus 31:18** -- "two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the **finger** (etsba) of God"
- **Deuteronomy 9:10** -- "two tables of stone written with the **finger** (etsba) of God"

### Significance for This Study
The phrase "finger of God" (etsba elohim) occurs only three times in the OT: once in the plague context (Exo 8:19) and twice in reference to the writing on the stone tablets (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10). The "finger of God" is unique to the Decalogue's authorship -- no other legislation is described as written by God's finger. Moses wrote the book of the law (Deu 31:9,24); God's finger wrote the Ten Commandments. This is one of the seven markers identified in law-01.

## [G3316](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3316/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - mesites (μεσίτης) -- "mediator"
**Original:** μεσίτης
**Transliteration:** mesítēs
**Pronunciation:** mes-ee-tace
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Definition:** Go-between, internunciator
**Occurrences:** 6 total in the NT

### All Occurrences
| Verse | Translation |
|-------|-------------|
| Galatians 3:19 | "in the hand of a **mediator**" |
| Galatians 3:20 | "a **mediator** is not a mediator of one" |
| 1 Timothy 2:5 | "one **mediator** between God and men" |
| Hebrews 8:6 | "he is the **mediator** of a better covenant" |
| Hebrews 9:15 | "he is the **mediator** of the new testament" |
| Hebrews 12:24 | "Jesus the **mediator** of the new covenant" |

### OT Background
The lexicon lists Deu 5:5 and Job 9:33 as OT references. Deu 5:5 uses Moses' own description of his mediator role: "I stood between the LORD and you at that time."

### Significance for This Study
Galatians 3:19 states the law was "ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator." This is directly relevant because:
1. The Decalogue was spoken by God directly to the people (Exo 20:1; Deu 5:4,22) -- no mediator needed
2. The subsequent laws were given through Moses as mediator (Exo 20:19-22; Deu 5:23-31)
3. Paul's statement that the law came "in the hand of a mediator" applies to the legislation given through Moses, which occurred after the people requested mediation
4. Verse 20 adds: "a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one" -- distinguishing the mediated law from God's direct act

In Hebrews, mesites is used exclusively for Jesus as mediator of the new/better covenant (Heb 8:6; 9:15; 12:24).

## [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - entole (ἐντολή) -- "commandment"
**Original:** ἐντολή
**Transliteration:** entolḗ
**Pronunciation:** en-tol-ay
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** Injunction, authoritative prescription
**Occurrences:** 43 in the KJV (71 per BLB count including variant forms)

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| commandment | 23 | 53.5% |
| commandments | 12 | 27.9% |
| precept | 2 | 4.7% |
| a commandment | 2 | 4.7% |

### Key Verses for This Study
- **Romans 7:12** -- "the **commandment** (entole) holy, and just, and good"
- **Romans 13:9** -- "it is briefly comprehended in this saying... Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (summarizing several Decalogue commands)
- **Ephesians 2:15** -- "the law of **commandments** (entole) contained in ordinances (dogma)"
- **1 John 2:3,7** -- "keep his **commandments** (entole)"
- **Revelation 12:17** -- "keep the **commandments** (entole) of God"
- **Revelation 14:12** -- "keep the **commandments** (entole) of God"

### Significance for This Study
Entole is used in the NT for commandments in general -- it can refer to individual Decalogue commands (Rom 7:8-12; 13:9), to God's commandments broadly (1 John, Revelation), or to ceremonial prescriptions (Heb 7:5,16,18; 9:19). Context determines the referent. Notably, in Eph 2:15 entole appears WITH dogma ("law of commandments contained in ordinances"), which is the only NT passage where these two terms are combined.

## [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - dogma (δόγμα) -- "ordinance/decree"
**Original:** δόγμα
**Transliteration:** dógma
**Pronunciation:** dog-mah
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**Definition:** Law (civil, ceremonial)
**Occurrences:** 5 total in the NT

### All Occurrences
| Verse | Translation | Context |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Luke 2:1 | "a **decree**" | Caesar's decree for taxation |
| Acts 16:4 | "**decrees**" | Apostolic decrees from Jerusalem council |
| Acts 17:7 | "**decrees**" | Decrees of Caesar |
| Ephesians 2:15 | "of **ordinances**" | "the law of commandments contained in ordinances" |
| Colossians 2:14 | "**ordinances**" | "handwriting of ordinances... nailed to his cross" |

### OT LXX References
Dan 2:13; 3:10; 4:3; 6:13 -- all referring to human/royal decrees

### Significance for This Study
Dogma is used in the two key "cessation" passages (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14). In secular usage (Luke 2:1; Acts 17:7) it means a governmental decree. In Acts 16:4 it refers to the apostolic council's decisions. In Eph 2:15 and Col 2:14 it describes what was "abolished" or "nailed to the cross."

The word dogma is NEVER used for the moral law or the Decalogue in the NT. The Decalogue is referred to with entole (commandment) or nomos (law). Law-01 established this distinction: all cessation-vocabulary E-items use dogma or specify ceremonial items. This word study confirms that dogma has a limited semantic range (civil/ceremonial decrees) and does not overlap with the terminology used for the Ten Commandments.
