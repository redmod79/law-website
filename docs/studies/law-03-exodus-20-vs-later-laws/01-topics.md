## Question
How does the Exodus narrative distinguish the Decalogue from the laws given afterward? Investigate the two-stage giving of the law: (1) God speaks the Ten Commandments directly to the people (Exo 20:1-17), the people tremble and ask Moses to mediate (Exo 20:18-21); (2) God gives additional "judgments" through Moses (Exo 21-23), the sanctuary/ceremonial instructions through Moses (Exo 25-31). Examine the two repositories: tables of stone placed INSIDE the Ark (Exo 25:16; Deu 10:1-5) vs. the book of the law placed BESIDE the Ark (Deu 31:24-26). Study Deu 4:13-14 where Moses explicitly distinguishes "his covenant, the ten commandments" from "statutes and judgments." Deu 5:22: "These words the LORD spake... and he added no more."

## Topics

### DECALOGUE
Written by God: EXO 24:12; 31:18; 32:16; DEU 5:22; 9:10; HOS 8:12
Divine authority of: EXO 20:1; 34:27,28; DEU 5:4-22
Called WORDS OF THE COVENANT: EXO 34:28; DEU 4:13
Called TABLES OF TESTIMONY: EXO 31:18; 34:29; 40:20
See COMMANDMENTS: EXO 20:1-17; DEU 5:7-21; MAT 19:18,19; 22:34-40; LUK 10:25-28; ROM 13:8-10

**Observations for this study:** Nave's explicitly catalogues the Decalogue's unique features: written by God (not Moses), divine authority, and distinctive naming conventions ("words of the covenant," "tables of testimony"). These are the very distinctions this study investigates.

### TEN COMMANDMENTS / COMMANDMENTS
Nave's cross-references TEN COMMANDMENTS to COMMANDMENTS. The COMMANDMENTS entry covers:
- General scriptures: EXO 13:8-10; 20:3-17; DEU 4:5,9,10; 5:6-21; 6:4-9; 11:18-21; 32:46,47; JOS 8:30-35
- Precepts of Jesus: MAT 5:16,22-24,27-48; 19:16-19; 22:21,34-40; JHN 14:15,23,24; 15:10-12
- Cross-references: See DECALOGUE, See TABLES
- Of men (distinguished from God's): ISA 29:13; MAT 15:3-20; MRK 7:2-23

### COVENANT
Key entries relevant to this study:
- Blood of: EXO 24:8
- Book of: EXO 24:7
- The Mosaic law called a covenant: EXO 34:28
- Binding: JOS 9:18-20; JER 34:8-21; GAL 3:15
- Of the Ten Commandments: EXO 34:28; DEU 5:2,3; 9:9
- Of the sabbath: EXO 31:16
- With Israel, at Horeb: DEU 5:2,3
- The second covenant: JER 31:31-34; HEB 8:4-13; 12:18-24; 13:20
- Everlasting: GEN 8:20-22; 9:1-17; PSA 105:8,10; ISA 54:10; 61:8

**Observations for this study:** Nave's distinguishes "the book of the covenant" (EXO 24:7) from "the Ten Commandments" as a covenant (EXO 34:28; DEU 5:2,3; 9:9). These are two different documents associated with the covenant concept.

### ARK (OF THE COVENANT)
Named variously:
- Ark of the Covenant: NUM 10:33; DEU 31:26; JOS 4:7; HEB 9:4
- Ark of the Testimony: EXO 30:6
- Ark of the Lord: JOS 4:11; 1SA 4:6
- Ark of God: 1SA 3:3; 2SA 6:7
- Ark of God's Strength: 2CH 6:41

Contents:
- **The law**: EXO 25:16,21; 40:20; DEU 10:5; 31:26; 1KI 8:9; 2CH 5:10
- Aaron's rod: NUM 17:10; HEB 9:4
- Pot of manna: EXO 16:33,34; HEB 9:4

Directions for making: EXO 25:10-15; 35:12
Construction: EXO 37:1-5; DEU 10:3

**Observations for this study:** Nave's lists under "Contents" both EXO 25:16 (testimony put INTO the ark) and DEU 31:26 (book of the law placed by/beside the ark). These two repositories are catalogued together but refer to different objects: the stone tablets inside, and the book beside.

### LAW (OF MOSES)
Given at Sinai: EXO 19; DEU 1:1; 4:10-13; 33:2; HAB 3:3
Received by the disposition of angels: DEU 33:2; PSA 68:17; ACT 7:53; GAL 3:19; HEB 2:2
Was given because of transgressions until the Messiah arrived: GAL 3:19
Engraved on stone: EXO 20:3-17; with 24:12; 31:18; 32:16; 34:29; 40:20; DEU 4:13; 5:4-22; 9:10
Preserved in the ark of the covenant: EXO 25:16; DEU 31:9,26
Divine authority for: EXO 19:16-24; 20:1-17; 24:12-18; 31:18; 32:15,16; 34:1-4,27,28; LEV 26:46; DEU 4:10-13,36; 5:1-22; 9:10; 10:1-5; 33:2-4; ACT 7:38,53; GAL 3:19; HEB 9:18-21

Nave's also lists under LAW:
- TEMPORARY: JER 3:16; DAN 9:27; MAT 5:17-45; LUK 16:16,17; JHN 1:17; ROM 7:1-6; 8:3; 10:4; 2CO 3:7-14; GAL 2:3-9; EPH 2:15; COL 2:14-23; HEB 8:4-13; 9:8-24; 10:1-18; 12:18,19,27

**Observations for this study:** Nave's groups the stone-engraved law and the book of the law together under "LAW OF MOSES" but also provides separate entries under DECALOGUE that highlight the unique features of the Ten Commandments. The "TEMPORARY" subheading lists passages used in the Abolished position.

### MOSES
Key entries relevant to this study:
- Commissioned as leader: EXO 3:10-22; 6:13
- Receives the law and ordains various statutes (See LAW OF MOSES)
- God spoke to, as a man to his friend: EXO 33:11
- Magnified of God: EXO 19:9
- A type of the Messiah: DEU 18:15-18; ACT 3:22; 7:37
- Face transfigured: EXO 34:29-35; 2CO 3:13

**Observations for this study:** Moses' dual role is central -- he both receives the Decalogue on behalf of the people (after they request mediation) and receives additional legislation (mishpatim, sanctuary instructions) as mediator. The Nave's entry distinguishes his role as prophet/type of Messiah from his role as lawgiver.

### TABERNACLE
Pattern revealed to Moses: EXO 25:9; 26:30; 39:32,42,43; ACT 7:44; HEB 8:5
Materials voluntarily offered: EXO 25:1-8; 35:4-29
The Most Holy Place: EXO 26:33-35; 40:20,21; HEB 9:3-5,7,8
Symbol of spiritual things: PSA 15:1; HEB 8:2,5; 9:1-12,24

**Observations for this study:** The tabernacle/sanctuary instructions (Exo 25-31) are given to Moses on the mountain AFTER the people request mediation and AFTER the Decalogue is spoken directly. This represents a third category of legislation (sanctuary/ceremonial) given through a different delivery mode than the Decalogue.

### TESTIMONY
Ark of (See ARK)
Nave's cross-references the term "testimony" to the Ark entry. The word "testimony" (Hebrew: eduth, H5715) is used as a name for the Decalogue: "tables of testimony" (EXO 31:18; 34:29), "the testimony" (EXO 25:16,21; 40:20).

### MEDIATION
Nave's entry is brief: See INTERCESSION; JESUS, MEDIATOR. The concept of mediation between God and the people is central to this study but not extensively catalogued as a standalone Nave's topic. The relevant data comes from the narrative passages (Exo 20:18-21; Deu 5:23-31; Gal 3:19-20).

## Related Topics Discovered
During gathering, the following additional connections were noted:
- **INTERCESSION** -- Moses' role as intercessor/mediator connects to the two-stage delivery
- **JESUS, MEDIATOR** -- NT parallel to Moses as mediator (Gal 3:19-20; Heb 8:6; 9:15; 12:24)
- The Nave's distinction between "book of the covenant" (EXO 24:7) and "words of the covenant, the ten commandments" (EXO 34:28) directly maps to the two-document thesis
