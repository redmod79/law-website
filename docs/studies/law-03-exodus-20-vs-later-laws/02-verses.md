## Question
How does the Exodus narrative distinguish the Decalogue from the laws given afterward?

---

## A. The Two-Stage Delivery -- Stage 1: God Speaks the Decalogue Directly

### Exodus 19:16-25 (The Theophany at Sinai)

> **Exodus 19:16** And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.
> **Exodus 19:17** And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
> **Exodus 19:18** And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
> **Exodus 19:19** And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.
> **Exodus 19:20** And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
> **Exodus 19:21** And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.
> **Exodus 19:22** And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.
> **Exodus 19:23** And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
> **Exodus 19:24** And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.
> **Exodus 19:25** So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

**Context (Exodus 19:1-15):** God instructs Moses to sanctify the people for three days. God announces: "I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever" (19:9). The explicit purpose is for the people to hear God's voice directly.

### Exodus 20:1-17 (The Ten Commandments -- God Speaks Directly)

> **Exodus 20:1** And God spake all these words, saying,
> **Exodus 20:2** I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
> **Exodus 20:3** Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
> **Exodus 20:4** Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
> **Exodus 20:5** Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;
> **Exodus 20:6** And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
> **Exodus 20:7** Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
> **Exodus 20:8** Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
> **Exodus 20:9** Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:
> **Exodus 20:10** But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
> **Exodus 20:11** For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
> **Exodus 20:12** Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
> **Exodus 20:13** Thou shalt not kill.
> **Exodus 20:14** Thou shalt not commit adultery.
> **Exodus 20:15** Thou shalt not steal.
> **Exodus 20:16** Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
> **Exodus 20:17** Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

### Exodus 20:18-21 (The People Request Mediation)

> **Exodus 20:18** And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.
> **Exodus 20:19** And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
> **Exodus 20:20** And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.
> **Exodus 20:21** And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.

### Exodus 20:22-26 (Transition: God Now Speaks to Moses)

> **Exodus 20:22** And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
> **Exodus 20:23** Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.
> **Exodus 20:24** An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.
> **Exodus 20:25** And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
> **Exodus 20:26** Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.

## B. The Two-Stage Delivery -- Stage 2: Laws Given Through Moses as Mediator

### Exodus 21:1-6 (The "Judgments" Begin -- Mishpatim)

> **Exodus 21:1** Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
> **Exodus 21:2** If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
> **Exodus 21:3** If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.
> **Exodus 21:4** If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.
> **Exodus 21:5** And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:
> **Exodus 21:6** Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.

**Note:** The text transitions from God speaking directly to the people (20:1-17) to Moses setting judgments before them (21:1). The introduction "Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them" marks a structural shift.

### Exodus 24:1-18 (The Covenant Ceremony and Moses Ascends the Mountain)

> **Exodus 24:1** And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off.
> **Exodus 24:2** And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.
> **Exodus 24:3** And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.
> **Exodus 24:4** And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
> **Exodus 24:5** And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.
> **Exodus 24:6** And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
> **Exodus 24:7** And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient.
> **Exodus 24:8** And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words.
> **Exodus 24:9** Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:
> **Exodus 24:10** And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.
> **Exodus 24:11** And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.
> **Exodus 24:12** And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.
> **Exodus 24:13** And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.
> **Exodus 24:14** And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.
> **Exodus 24:15** And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.
> **Exodus 24:16** And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
> **Exodus 24:17** And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.
> **Exodus 24:18** And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.

**Key observations in Exodus 24:**
- v.3: "all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments" -- Moses relays both
- v.4: "Moses wrote all the words of the LORD" -- Moses is the writer
- v.7: "the book of the covenant" -- a document Moses wrote
- v.12: "tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written" -- God is the writer of the stone tablets; this is AFTER Moses wrote the book

### Exodus 25:1-22 (Sanctuary Instructions -- Given to Moses on the Mount)

> **Exodus 25:1** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
> **Exodus 25:2** Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering...
> **Exodus 25:8** And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.
> **Exodus 25:9** According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.
> **Exodus 25:10** And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.
> **Exodus 25:16** And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.
> **Exodus 25:21** And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.
> **Exodus 25:22** And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.

**Note:** The sanctuary instructions (Exo 25-31) are given to Moses alone on the mountain. The people do not hear any of this directly. The Ark is designed specifically to house "the testimony."

### Exodus 31:18 (The Stone Tablets Given to Moses)

> **Exodus 31:18** And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.

---

## C. The Two Repositories

### Exodus 25:16, 21 (Testimony Placed INSIDE the Ark)

> **Exodus 25:16** And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.
> **Exodus 25:21** And in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

### Exodus 40:20 (Moses Places the Testimony in the Ark)

> **Exodus 40:20** And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:

### Deuteronomy 10:1-5 (Moses Recounts Placing the Tables in the Ark)

> **Deuteronomy 10:1** At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.
> **Deuteronomy 10:2** And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.
> **Deuteronomy 10:3** And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.
> **Deuteronomy 10:4** And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.
> **Deuteronomy 10:5** And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.

### 1 Kings 8:9 (Nothing in the Ark but the Two Tables)

> **1 Kings 8:9** There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.

### 2 Chronicles 5:10 (Parallel Account)

> **2 Chronicles 5:10** There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

### Deuteronomy 31:9 (Moses Writes "This Law")

> **Deuteronomy 31:9** And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.

### Deuteronomy 31:24-26 (The Book of the Law Placed BESIDE the Ark)

> **Deuteronomy 31:24** And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
> **Deuteronomy 31:25** That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,
> **Deuteronomy 31:26** Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.

**Key distinction:**
- Tables of stone: God wrote them (Exo 31:18; Deu 10:4); placed INSIDE the ark (Exo 25:16; 40:20; Deu 10:5)
- Book of the law: Moses wrote it (Deu 31:9,24); placed BESIDE/IN THE SIDE OF the ark (Deu 31:26)

### Hebrews 9:1-5 (NT Description of the Ark's Contents)

> **Hebrews 9:1** Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
> **Hebrews 9:2** For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.
> **Hebrews 9:3** And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;
> **Hebrews 9:4** Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
> **Hebrews 9:5** And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.

## D. Moses' Explicit Distinctions in Deuteronomy

### Deuteronomy 4:10-14 (Moses Distinguishes "His Covenant" from "Statutes and Judgments")

> **Deuteronomy 4:10** Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.
> **Deuteronomy 4:11** And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.
> **Deuteronomy 4:12** And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.
> **Deuteronomy 4:13** And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.
> **Deuteronomy 4:14** And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.

**Key observation:** Verse 13 identifies "his covenant" as "ten commandments" written on "two tables of stone." Verse 14 immediately introduces a different category: "statutes and judgments" which the LORD commanded Moses to teach. The subject changes from God declaring directly (v.13) to God commanding Moses to teach (v.14).

### Deuteronomy 5:1-33 (Moses Recounts the Sinai Event)

> **Deuteronomy 5:1** And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.
> **Deuteronomy 5:2** The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
> **Deuteronomy 5:3** The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
> **Deuteronomy 5:4** The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,
> **Deuteronomy 5:5** (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,
> **Deuteronomy 5:6-21** [The Ten Commandments repeated -- see Exodus 20:2-17 above]
> **Deuteronomy 5:22** These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.
> **Deuteronomy 5:23** And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
> **Deuteronomy 5:24** And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.
> **Deuteronomy 5:25** Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.
> **Deuteronomy 5:26** For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
> **Deuteronomy 5:27** Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.
> **Deuteronomy 5:28** And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.
> **Deuteronomy 5:29** O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
> **Deuteronomy 5:30** Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.
> **Deuteronomy 5:31** But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
> **Deuteronomy 5:32** Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
> **Deuteronomy 5:33** Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.

**Key observations in Deuteronomy 5:**
- v.4: "The LORD talked with you face to face" -- the people heard directly
- v.5: Moses stood between -- but this was to "shew you the word of the LORD" because they "were afraid"
- v.22: "he added no more" -- after speaking the Ten Commandments, God stopped speaking directly to the people; "he wrote them in two tables of stone"
- v.23-27: The people, having heard God's voice, request Moses to mediate all future communication
- v.28: God approves the people's request
- v.31: God then tells Moses to stay and receive "all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments" -- these are the additional laws Moses will mediate

### Deuteronomy 9:9-11 (Tables of Stone = Tables of the Covenant)

> **Deuteronomy 9:9** When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:
> **Deuteronomy 9:10** And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
> **Deuteronomy 9:11** And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.

## E. The Naming Conventions

### Exodus 32:15-16 (The Tables Described)

> **Exodus 32:15** And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
> **Exodus 32:16** And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.

### Exodus 34:1-4 (Replacement Tables)

> **Exodus 34:1** And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.
> **Exodus 34:2** And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.
> **Exodus 34:3** And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
> **Exodus 34:4** And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.

### Exodus 34:27-29 (Words of the Covenant / Tables of Testimony)

> **Exodus 34:27** And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.
> **Exodus 34:28** And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
> **Exodus 34:29** And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.

### Exodus 24:7 ("The Book of the Covenant")

> **Exodus 24:7** And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient.

> **Nehemiah 9:14** And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:

**Key observation:** Verse 13 describes what God did directly ("spakest with them from heaven"). Verse 14 describes what God did through Moses ("commandedst them... by the hand of Moses thy servant"). The Sabbath is specifically mentioned in connection with the direct communication from heaven.

### Hebrews 12:18-26 (NT Recollection of Sinai)

> **Hebrews 12:18** For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,

### 2 Corinthians 3:3-14 (Written and Engraven in Stones)

> **2 Corinthians 3:9** For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
> **2 Corinthians 3:10** For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
