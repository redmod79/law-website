# Bible Study: Commandments of God in Revelation -- End-Time Identification and the Moral Law

## Question
What commandments are in Revelation and what do they mean? Investigate Rev 12:17 ("the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ"), Rev 14:12 ("Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus"), and Rev 22:14 in the Textus Receptus ("Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life"). Study the Greek grammar: what is entolas tou theou (commandments of God) -- does "commandments of God" in Revelation refer to the Decalogue, to NT commands, or to something else? Examine the dual identification marks of God's end-time people (commandments + faith/testimony). Investigate the three angels' messages connection (Rev 14:6-12) and whether "commandments of God" in the context of end-time judgment points to the moral law.

### Related Existing Studies

| Study | Question | Relevance |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| revelation-commandments | Study ALL verses in Revelation that reference "commandments." Greek grammar, NT/OT parallels, identify what commandments are referred to. | **Directly relevant.** Already analyzed Rev 12:17, 14:12, 22:14 in detail. Found they refer to the Decalogue. |
| law-14-jesus-law-teachings | What did Jesus specifically teach about the law and commandments? | Established the commandment-authority chain: Father -> Jesus -> disciples -> end-time saints. Same entole vocabulary throughout. |
| law-20-nt-greek-law-vocabulary | What do entole, nomos, dogma, cheirographon, dikaioma reveal about law categories? | Established entole unqualified = moral commands (43/43 instances). Dogma = never moral (0/5). Vocabulary partitions cleanly. |
| law-21-nt-vocab-law-categories | How does NT vocabulary distinguish moral, ceremonial, and civil law? | Mapped every entole occurrence to identifiable content. All unqualified entole = moral/Decalogue. Ceremonial uses have qualifier. |
| law-27-sabbath-still-in-effect | Is the seventh-day Sabbath still binding today? | Cites Rev 14:12 and 12:17 as evidence of end-time commandment-keeping. Notes Rev 14:7 echoes Exo 20:11 (4th commandment). |
| ecclesiastes-12-revelation-14-parallel | Connection between Ecc 12:13-14 and Rev 14:6-7,12? | Demonstrated Fear God + Keep Commandments + Judgment pattern runs from Deuteronomy through Ecclesiastes to Revelation. |
| law-01-gods-moral-law | What is God's moral law? | Registered Rev 12:17 as E031, Rev 14:12 as E032, Rev 22:14 as E033 in the master evidence database. All classified Continues. |

**Key Findings from Prior Study Conclusions:**

1. **revelation-commandments study** (completed 2026-02-11): Analyzed all three Revelation commandment verses. Found the definite article in "THE commandments" (tas entolas) marks them as a specific known body of commands. The genitive "of God" (tou theou) distinguishes from human commands. The fourth commandment is explicitly echoed in Rev 14:7 (creation-worship language from Exo 20:11). The dual identification formula (commandments + faith/testimony) resists both legalism and antinomianism.

2. **law-20/law-21 vocabulary studies**: Entole (G1785) without qualifier = moral/Decalogue content in 43/43 identifiable NT instances. When entole appears in a ceremonial context, a qualifier is always present (sarkines in Heb 7:16, en dogmasin in Eph 2:15, anthropon in Tit 1:14). This is a complete distribution pattern. Dogma (G1378) is never used for God's moral commandments.

3. **law-14 Jesus law teachings study**: Jesus uses the same word entole for "my commandments" (Jhn 14:15), "my Father's commandments" (Jhn 15:10), and these are the same "commandments of God" in Revelation. 24 explicit statements found; 17 Continues, 7 Neutral, 0 Abolished.

4. **law-27 Sabbath study**: The Revelation commandment passages (Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14) are classified as Continues E-items in the master evidence database (E031, E032, E033). The Sabbath is specifically implicated by Rev 14:7's echo of Exo 20:11.

5. **ecclesiastes-12-revelation-14-parallel study**: The "everlasting gospel" of Rev 14:6-7,12 restates the "conclusion of the whole matter" from Ecc 12:13-14. Both contain: Fear God + Keep Commandments + Judgment.

### Focus Areas

**NOTE:** The prior study `revelation-commandments` already covered the three core verses. Law-28 as a LAW SERIES study must apply the law-series methodology (evidence classification with E/N/I tiers, positional classification as Continues/Abolished/Neutral, Tree 3 four-gate validation, and evidence database registration). This is the unique contribution of law-28 beyond the prior study.

1. **Greek Grammar Deep Dive** -- Parse Rev 12:17, 14:12, and 22:14 using greek_parser.py. Analyze the exact grammatical forms of entolas tou theou (case, number, article pattern). Compare the TR vs. critical text variant in Rev 22:14 using greek_text_compare.py.

2. **Entole in Revelation vs. Broader NT** -- The prior studies (law-20, law-21) established the entole distribution pattern. This study should verify how the Revelation instances fit that pattern and whether the apocalyptic genre (Gate 3 of Tree 3) affects the positional classification.

3. **The Dual Identification Marks** -- Analyze the pairing of commandments + testimony/faith across Rev 12:17, 14:12, and 20:4. What is "the testimony of Jesus" (martyria Iesou)? Rev 19:10 defines it as "the spirit of prophecy." What is "the faith of Jesus" (pistin Iesou) -- objective genitive (faith IN Jesus) or subjective genitive (faith OF Jesus)?

4. **Three Angels' Messages Connection** -- Analyze Rev 14:6-12 as a unit. The first angel's creation-worship language (14:7) echoes Exo 20:11 (4th commandment). How does the judgment context (14:7) connect to commandment-keeping (14:12)?

5. **Rev 22:14 Textual Variant** -- Compare TR reading (poiountes tas entolas autou = "those doing his commandments") vs. critical text (plunontes tas stolas auton = "those washing their robes"). Analyze both readings for theological implications. Use greek_text_compare.py.

6. **Dragon's War Against Commandment-Keepers** -- Rev 12:17 places commandment-keeping in a cosmic conflict context. The dragon targets the remnant specifically because they keep God's commandments. Connect to Dan 7:25 (attempt to change times and laws).

7. **Commandments-Life Connection** -- Rev 22:14 links commandment-doing to "right to the tree of life." Compare with Mat 19:17 ("if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments"), Luk 10:28, Jhn 12:50.

8. **Law-Series Evidence Classification** -- Apply the full law-series methodology: classify all findings as E/N/I items, determine positional classification (Continues/Abolished/Neutral), run Tree 3 four-gate validation for E-items, register items in the evidence database.
