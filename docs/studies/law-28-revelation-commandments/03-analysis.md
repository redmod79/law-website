## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Revelation 12:17

> And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

**Context:** The closing verse of Revelation 12, which narrates the cosmic conflict between the dragon (identified as "that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan" in v.9) and the woman (representing God's people through history). The dragon has failed to destroy the man child (v.5), has been cast from heaven (vv.7-9), has persecuted the woman during the 1260-day period (vv.6, 14), and now turns to "the remnant of her seed" — the final generation.

**Greek Grammar:**
- **ton terounton** (τῶν τηρούντων) — Present Active Participle, Genitive Plural Masculine. The present tense indicates ongoing, habitual, characteristic action. These are not people who kept commandments once but who are characteristically commandment-keepers. The genitive case is appositional to "ton loipon tou spermatos autes" ("the remnant of her seed"), further defining who the remnant are.
- **tas entolas** (τὰς ἐντολὰς) — Accusative Plural Feminine with the definite article. The article "tas" (THE commandments) marks a specific, known body of commands — not generic instructions. The plural "entolas" indicates more than one commandment.
- **tou Theou** (τοῦ Θεοῦ) — Genitive Singular Masculine with the definite article. This genitive identifies the source/author of the commandments as God, distinguishing them from human commands (entalma, [G1778](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1778/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, used for "commandments of men" in Mat 15:9; Mrk 7:7; Col 2:22).
- **ten martyrian Iesou** (τὴν μαρτυρίαν Ἰησοῦ) — Accusative Singular Feminine with the article, followed by a genitive proper noun. The genitive "Iesou" is best understood as a subjective genitive (the testimony that Jesus gives), based on Rev 19:10 where "the testimony of Jesus IS the spirit of prophecy" (he martyria Iesou estin to pneuma tes propheteias).

**Direct statement:** The dragon (Satan) makes war specifically against people identified by two marks: (1) they keep the commandments of God, and (2) they have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

**Key observations:**
1. The dual identification creates a composite portrait: obedience to God's commands AND the testimony/prophetic witness of Jesus. Neither alone is sufficient to identify the remnant.
2. The dragon's war targets commandment-keepers. This implies that commandment-keeping is a distinguishing characteristic that provokes satanic opposition — it is not universal or assumed.
3. The phrase "entolas tou theou" (commandments of God) uses the same vocabulary as 1 Cor 7:19 ("the keeping of the commandments of God"), 1 Jhn 5:2-3 ("keep his commandments"), and Rev 14:12. Prior studies (law-20, law-21) established that entole unqualified refers to moral/Decalogue content in 43 of 43 identifiable NT instances.
4. The cosmic conflict context (dragon vs. remnant) parallels Daniel 7:21-22, 25 where the horn "made war with the saints" and "think to change times and laws."

**Cross-references:**
- Dan 7:25: The power that "thinks to change times and laws" is the adversary of God's people. Rev 12:17 shows the final result: a remnant who keep the unchanged commandments despite this attempted alteration.
- Gen 3:15: The enmity between the serpent and the woman's seed is the prototype of Rev 12:17. The same serpent (Rev 12:9 = Gen 3:1) targets the same lineage.
- Rev 19:10: Defines "the testimony of Jesus" as "the spirit of prophecy."
- 1 Jhn 5:2-3: "This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments." Same author (John), same vocabulary (entolas + autou).

### Revelation 14:12

> Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

**Context:** This verse is the concluding characterization after the three angels' messages (Rev 14:6-11). The first angel proclaims the "everlasting gospel" with a call to "fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters" (v.7). The second angel announces Babylon's fall (v.8). The third angel warns against beast worship (vv.9-11). Then v.12 identifies who the saints are in contrast to the beast-worshippers.

**Greek Grammar:**
- **hode he hupomone ton hagion estin** (Ὧδε ἡ ὑπομονὴ τῶν ἁγίων ἐστίν) — "Here is the patience/endurance of the saints." hupomone (G5281) = not passive suffering but cheerful, hopeful endurance under pressure.
- **hoi terountes** (οἱ τηροῦντες) — Present Active Participle, Nominative Plural Masculine with the article. This is a substantival participle: "the ones keeping." The nominative case makes it an appositive defining who the saints are. The present tense again marks ongoing characteristic action.
- **tas entolas tou Theou** — Identical construction to Rev 12:17. THE commandments OF GOD. Same definite article, same genitive of source/author.
- **kai ten pistin Iesou** (καὶ τὴν πίστιν Ἰησοῦ) — "and the faith of Jesus." pistin (G4102) = faith, with the definite article (THE faith). The genitive "Iesou" is debated: subjective (the faithfulness that Jesus himself had/has) or objective (faith directed toward Jesus). The parallel structure — entolas tou Theou (commandments that belong to God) paired with pistin Iesou (faith that belongs to/relates to Jesus) — may suggest consistency: both genitives indicate the person to whom the noun relates.

**Direct statement:** The patience/endurance of the saints consists of two things: keeping the commandments of God and holding the faith of Jesus.

**Key observations:**
1. This verse defines what "patience of the saints" means — it is commandment-keeping + faith-holding under persecution. The endurance is not mere passive waiting but active obedience and faith.
2. The dual formula (commandments of God + faith of Jesus) matches Rev 12:17 (commandments of God + testimony of Jesus), with "faith of Jesus" replacing "testimony of Jesus." Both passages describe the same people from different angles.
3. The placement after the three angels' messages is critical. Rev 14:7 calls humanity to "worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea" — language directly echoing Exo 20:11, the rationale of the Fourth Commandment: "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is." The verbal parallels are:
   - Rev 14:7: "made heaven, and earth, and the sea" (ton poiesanta ton ouranon kai ten gen kai ten thalassan)
   - Exo 20:11 (LXX): "the LORD made heaven and earth, and the sea" (epoiesen kyrion ton ouranon kai ten gen kai ten thalassan)
4. The three angels' messages framework: (1) worship the Creator, (2) reject Babylon, (3) refuse the beast's mark. Those who do all three are identified in v.12 as commandment-keepers.
5. The connection to Ecc 12:13-14 is verbally precise: "Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment." Rev 14:7,12 contains the same triad: fear God + keep commandments + judgment.

**Cross-references:**
- Ecc 12:13-14: The "conclusion of the whole matter" matches the three angels' messages pattern (fear God + commandments + judgment). *(Examined in depth in the ecclesiastes-12-revelation-14-parallel study.)*
- Exo 20:8-11: The creation-worship language of Rev 14:7 echoes the Fourth Commandment's rationale.
- Rev 13:10: "Here is the patience and the faith of the saints" — the preceding hode-statement, using the same vocabulary (hupomone + pistis + hagios).
- 1 Jhn 5:3: "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments" — same author, same vocabulary.

### Revelation 14:6-7 (The First Angel's Message)

> And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

**Context:** The opening of the three angels' messages, presented as a universal ("every nation, kindred, tongue, and people") proclamation of the "everlasting gospel."

**Direct statement:** The everlasting gospel includes: (1) Fear God, (2) Give glory to him, (3) The hour of his judgment has come, (4) Worship the Creator of heaven, earth, and sea.

**Key observations:**
1. The creation-worship language ("him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea") verbally echoes Exo 20:11 ("the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea"). The Sabbath commandment is the only one of the Ten Commandments that identifies God as Creator.
2. The phrase "the hour of his judgment is come" places the commandment-keeping of v.12 in a judgment context. Commandments serve as the standard of judgment.
3. This is called "the everlasting gospel" (euangelion aionion) — not a new or temporary message but an eternal one, consistent with commandments that are "sure" and "stand fast for ever and ever" (Psa 111:7-8).

### Revelation 14:8-11 (Second and Third Angel)

> And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God...

**Context:** The second angel announces Babylon's fall. The third warns against receiving the mark of the beast. These set up the contrast that v.12 resolves.

**Direct statement:** Those who worship the beast receive God's wrath. Those who refuse the beast are the saints described in v.12.

**Key observations:**
1. The contrast is binary: beast-worshippers (vv.9-11) vs. commandment-keepers (v.12). There is no middle category.
2. The mark of the beast is connected to worship (vv.9, 11), and the alternative to false worship is the true worship of the Creator (v.7). The commandments define the terms of true worship (first four commandments address worship: no other gods, no images, no vain use of God's name, remember the Sabbath).

---

### Revelation 22:14

> Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.

**Context:** The closing chapter of Revelation and the Bible. This beatitude (one of seven in Revelation: 1:3; 14:13; 16:15; 19:9; 20:6; 22:7; 22:14) is near the final words of the canon.

**Textual variant:** The N1904 (Nestle/Critical Text) reads "makarioi hoi plunontes tas stolas auton" ("Blessed are those washing their robes"). The TR (Textus Receptus/KJV) reads "makarioi hoi poiountes tas entolas autou" ("Blessed are those doing his commandments"). The KJV follows the TR. The text comparison confirms the variant: N1904 has plunontes (G4150, washing) + stolas (G4749, robes), while the TR has poiountes (G4160, doing) + entolas (G1785, commandments).

**Greek Grammar (TR reading):**
- **hoi poiountes** (οἱ ποιοῦντες) — Present Active Participle, Nominative Plural Masculine with the article. "The ones doing." Present tense = ongoing, characteristic action.
- **tas entolas autou** (τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ) — "HIS commandments." Same definite article + entolas as Rev 12:17 and 14:12, with autou (his) instead of tou Theou (of God). Since the speaker context includes Jesus (v.16: "I Jesus have sent mine angel"), "his" refers to God/Christ.

**Direct statement (TR):** Those who do God's commandments are blessed and receive access to the tree of life and entrance into the city.

**Key observations:**
1. Commandment-doing is connected to access to the tree of life. This reverses the Genesis 3 exclusion: Adam and Eve were barred from the tree of life after disobedience (Gen 3:22-24); those who do God's commandments receive "right to the tree of life" — restored access through obedience.
2. The commandment-life connection appears elsewhere: Mat 19:17 ("if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments"), Luk 10:28 ("this do, and thou shalt live"), Jhn 12:50 ("his commandment is life everlasting").
3. Even under the N1904 reading ("washing their robes"), the theological point of access to the tree of life remains. The "robes washed" language appears in Rev 7:14 ("washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb") and connects to justification. Both readings point to redeemed people entering God's presence.
4. The TR reading creates a three-verse chain in Revelation using entole for God's commandments: Rev 12:17 (terounton tas entolas), Rev 14:12 (terountes tas entolas), Rev 22:14 (poiountes tas entolas).

**Cross-references:**
- Gen 2:9; 3:22-24: The tree of life in Eden, access removed after sin.
- Rev 22:2: The tree of life in the New Jerusalem, bearing twelve fruits.
- Mat 19:17: Jesus says "if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments" — then lists Decalogue commands.
- Deu 30:16: "I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments...that thou mayest live."

### Revelation 19:10

> And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

**Context:** After the marriage supper of the Lamb announcement (vv.7-9), John falls to worship the angel, who corrects him and provides a definition of "the testimony of Jesus."

**Greek Grammar:**
- **ton echonton ten martyrian Iesou** (τῶν ἐχόντων τὴν μαρτυρίαν Ἰησοῦ) — "the ones having the testimony of Jesus." echonton = Present Active Participle, Genitive Plural Masculine. Same form as echonton in Rev 12:17.
- **he gar martyria Iesou estin to pneuma tes propheteias** (ἡ γὰρ μαρτυρία Ἰησοῦ ἐστιν τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς προφητείας) — "For the testimony of Jesus IS the spirit of prophecy." estin (G1510) = Present Active Indicative, third person singular. This is a definitive equation: testimony of Jesus = spirit of prophecy. The gar (for) is explanatory — it explains why the angel is a "fellowservant."

**Direct statement:** The testimony of Jesus is defined as the spirit of prophecy. Those who have this testimony are the prophets/brethren (the angel calls John's "brethren" those "that have the testimony of Jesus").

**Key observations:**
1. This verse is the Rosetta Stone for Rev 12:17. It defines what "the testimony of Jesus" means: the prophetic gift, the spirit of prophecy.
2. The subjective genitive reading is confirmed: the testimony that Jesus gives (through prophetic revelation) = the spirit of prophecy.
3. This connects the remnant of Rev 12:17 to two identification marks: (1) commandment-keeping (moral law), (2) the spirit of prophecy (prophetic gift/witness).

### Revelation 1:1-2

> The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John: Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.

**Context:** The opening statement of Revelation, establishing the chain of revelation: God -> Jesus Christ -> angel -> John -> servants.

**Direct statement:** John bore record of "the word of God" and "the testimony of Jesus Christ." The word of God and the testimony of Jesus are paired at the opening of the book, just as they are paired with "commandments of God" in 12:17.

---

### Revelation 1:9

> I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.

**Context:** John identifies himself and explains his situation. He is on Patmos "for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ."

**Direct statement:** John is in exile specifically because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus — the same pair identified in Rev 12:17 as characteristics of the remnant.

**Key observations:** John himself exemplifies the pattern: persecuted (exile) for holding the testimony of Jesus and the word of God. The dragon's war against the remnant (12:17) is prefigured in John's own experience.

---

### Revelation 6:9

> And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.

**Direct statement:** The martyrs were slain "for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held."

**Key observations:** The pairing "word of God + testimony" is consistent through Revelation: 1:2, 1:9, 6:9, 12:11, 12:17, 20:4. Those faithful to God's word and to the testimony face persecution and death.

---

### Revelation 12:11

> And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.

**Context:** The overcomers in the cosmic conflict with the dragon.

**Direct statement:** Victory comes through the blood of the Lamb + the word of testimony + willingness to die.

**Key observations:** The threefold basis of overcoming: Christ's sacrifice (blood of the Lamb), personal witness (word of their testimony), and total commitment (loved not their lives unto death). This is the spiritual dynamic behind the commandment-keeping of 12:17 — it is not legalism but faith-driven obedience sealed by Christ's blood.

---

### Revelation 20:4

> And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.

**Context:** The millennial reign. Those seated on thrones are identified by three characteristics.

**Direct statement:** Those who reign with Christ are described as: (1) beheaded for the witness/testimony of Jesus, (2) for the word of God, (3) had not worshipped the beast or received his mark.

**Key observations:** The same identification marks from 12:17 and 14:12 appear again: testimony/witness of Jesus + word of God + refusal of beast-worship. The consistency across these passages reinforces that "commandments of God" and "testimony/faith of Jesus" are the defining characteristics of God's people in the end-time Revelation narrative.

---

### Revelation 13:10

> He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

**Context:** Immediately preceding the three angels' messages (Rev 14). The beast from the sea exercises authority for 42 months.

**Direct statement:** The patience and faith of the saints is called for in response to the beast's persecution.

**Key observations:** The formula "here is the patience and the faith of the saints" (13:10) is expanded in 14:12 to "here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." Rev 14:12 adds the commandment-keeping element, defining what the patience/faith of 13:10 consists of.

---

### Revelation 2:2, 2:19, 3:10 (Patience in the Churches)

**Rev 2:2:** "I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience."
**Rev 2:19:** "I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience."
**Rev 3:10:** "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience."

**Key observations:** hupomone (patience/endurance) characterizes the faithful churches throughout Revelation. The word appears 7 times in the book (1:9; 2:2; 2:3; 2:19; 3:10; 13:10; 14:12), culminating in 14:12 where it is defined as commandment-keeping + faith.

---

### Revelation 22:7

> Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.

**Context:** Near the close of Revelation.

**Direct statement:** Blessing is pronounced on those who keep (tereo, [G5083](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5083/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} — the same verb as in 12:17 and 14:12) "the sayings of the prophecy of this book."

**Key observations:** The same verb tereo (keep) connects the commandment-keeping of 12:17 and 14:12 with the keeping of prophetic truth in 22:7.

---

### Revelation 22:15

> For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.

**Context:** Immediately after 22:14, describing who is excluded from the city.

**Direct statement:** Those excluded include murderers and idolaters — violations of the Sixth Commandment ("Thou shalt not kill") and the First/Second Commandments ("No other gods"/"No graven images"). Also liars — violation of the Ninth Commandment ("Thou shalt not bear false witness").

**Key observations:** The sins that exclude people from the city correspond to specific Decalogue violations. This confirms that "his commandments" in v.14 refer to the same Decalogue whose violations are listed in v.15.

---

### Revelation 11:18

> And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.

**Direct statement:** Judgment involves rewarding the prophets and saints, and destroying the destroyers. The saints and prophets are the same groups identified in 12:17 and 14:12.

---

### Revelation 20:11-15

> And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it... and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.

**Direct statement:** The final judgment is "according to their works" and from what is "written in the books."

**Key observations:** If works are judged, a standard is needed. The commandments provide that standard. This judgment context reinforces the importance of commandment-keeping.

---

### Revelation 22:12

> And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.

**Direct statement:** Jesus rewards according to works. This immediately precedes the commandment-doing beatitude of v.14.

---

### Exodus 20:3-17 / Deuteronomy 5:6-21 (The Decalogue)

**Context:** The Ten Commandments as given at Sinai and restated by Moses.

**Key observations for this study:**
1. The commandments of God in Revelation use entole (G1785) — the same word used when Jesus cites the Decalogue in Mat 19:17-19.
2. The definite article in "THE commandments of God" points to a specific, recognized body of commands — the Decalogue is the primary body of divine commands designated by this title throughout the OT and NT.
3. Exo 20:8-11 provides the creation language echoed in Rev 14:7.

---

### Ecclesiastes 12:13-14

> Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.

**Direct statement:** The "conclusion of the whole matter" is fear God + keep commandments, with judgment as the reason.

**Key observations:** The pattern Fear God + Keep Commandments + Judgment appears in both Ecc 12:13-14 and Rev 14:7,12. This is not incidental — it is a structural parallel spanning the OT and NT.

---

### Daniel 7:25

> And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.

**Direct statement:** A power opposes God, wears out the saints, and "thinks to change times and laws."

**Key observations:**
1. The time period ("time, times, and half a time") matches Rev 12:14 exactly. The same period appears as 1260 days in Rev 12:6 and 42 months in Rev 13:5.
2. The "think to change times and laws" in Dan 7:25 is the action that provokes the remnant response of Rev 12:17. The dragon attempts to change God's law; the remnant keeps it unchanged.
3. The word "times" (zimniyn, Aramaic) in Dan 7:25 is notable. The only commandment that involves "times" is the Fourth — the Sabbath commandment specifying the seventh day.

---

### John 14:15; 15:10

> If ye love me, keep my commandments. (14:15)
> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. (15:10)

**Direct statement:** Jesus equates love with commandment-keeping, and identifies his commandments with his Father's commandments.

**Key observations:** The chain: Father's commandments = Jesus's commandments = commandments the disciples are to keep = commandments of God in Revelation. Same author (John), same vocabulary (entole), same love-obedience framework.

---

### 1 John 2:3-6; 3:22-24; 5:2-3

> And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. (2:3)
> This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. (5:3)

**Direct statement:** John defines knowing God and loving God as keeping his commandments. Commandments are not grievous.

**Key observations:** John's epistles provide the theological framework for Revelation's commandment language. The same author who writes that "the commandments are not grievous" (1 Jhn 5:3) identifies the end-time saints by their commandment-keeping (Rev 12:17; 14:12).

---

### 1 Corinthians 7:19

> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.

**Direct statement:** Paul dismisses circumcision (a ceremonial requirement) as "nothing" while affirming that "the commandments of God" are what matters.

**Key observations:** The exact phrase "commandments of God" (entolas tou theou) that Paul affirms in 1 Cor 7:19 is the same phrase used in Rev 12:17 and 14:12. Paul explicitly separates the ceremonial (circumcision = nothing) from the moral (commandments of God = something). This is the same distinction made by the vocabulary partition: entole = moral, dogma = ceremonial.

---

### Romans 7:7, 12; 13:9-10

> The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. (7:12)
> Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. (13:9)

**Direct statement:** Paul identifies the commandments (entole) as holy, just, and good, and lists specific Decalogue commands under the term "commandment" (entole).

**Key observations:** When Paul uses entole and lists its content, he lists Decalogue commands. When Revelation says the saints "keep the commandments of God" using entole, the same content is indicated by the same word.

---

### 1 John 3:4

> Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.

**Direct statement:** Sin is defined as transgression of the law.

**Key observations:** If sin = law-breaking, then commandment-keeping (the opposite) = not sinning = righteousness. The saints described in Rev 12:17 and 14:12 are characterized by not transgressing the law.

---

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Consistent Dual Identification

Across Revelation, God's people are identified by a two-part formula:
- **Rev 12:17:** commandments of God + testimony of Jesus
- **Rev 14:12:** commandments of God + faith of Jesus
- **Rev 20:4:** witness of Jesus + word of God (same concept, different phrasing)
- **Rev 1:2:** word of God + testimony of Jesus
- **Rev 1:9:** word of God + testimony of Jesus
- **Rev 6:9:** word of God + testimony they held

The pattern is consistent: obedience to God's commands AND faith/testimony related to Jesus. Neither alone defines God's people — both are required. This resists both legalism (commandments without faith) and antinomianism (faith without commandments).

### Pattern 2: Entole (G1785) Used Exclusively in Revelation for God's Commandments

Revelation uses entole (G1785) for "commandments of God," never nomos (G3551, "law"). This is a significant vocabulary choice:
- Nomos does not appear in Revelation at all.
- Entole without a qualifier = moral/Decalogue content in 43/43 identifiable NT instances (established in law-20, law-21).
- When entole is used in a ceremonial context elsewhere in the NT, a qualifier is always present (sarkines in Heb 7:16, en dogmasin in Eph 2:15, anthropon in Tit 1:14).
- No qualifier appears with entole in any of the three Revelation commandment passages.

### Pattern 3: The Present Participle — Ongoing Characteristic Action

All three Revelation commandment passages use present active participles:
- Rev 12:17: terounton (keeping) — genitive participle
- Rev 14:12: terountes (keeping) — nominative participle
- Rev 22:14 (TR): poiountes (doing) — nominative participle

The present tense in Greek participles indicates ongoing, habitual action. These are not describing a single act of obedience but a characteristic lifestyle of commandment-keeping.

### Pattern 4: Fear God + Keep Commandments + Judgment

The triad appears in:
- Ecc 12:13-14: Fear God + keep commandments + judgment
- Rev 14:7,12: Fear God/worship Creator + keep commandments of God + hour of judgment

This structural parallel spans the OT (Ecclesiastes) into the NT (Revelation), indicating continuity of the commandment-keeping obligation from "the conclusion of the whole matter" to the "everlasting gospel."

### Pattern 5: Commandment-Doing = Life/Access

- Gen 2:16-17: God's first command in Eden; disobedience = death, obedience = continued access to the tree of life
- Lev 18:5: "Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them"
- Deu 30:16: "Keep his commandments...that thou mayest live"
- Mat 19:17: "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments"
- Luk 10:28: "This do, and thou shalt live"
- Jhn 12:50: "His commandment is life everlasting"
- Rev 22:14: "Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life"

The commandment-life connection runs from Genesis to Revelation.

### Pattern 6: The Vocabulary Partition

The NT uses three different Greek words for three different categories of commands:
- **Entole** (G1785) = God's moral commandments (what the saints keep)
- **Dogma** (G1378) = decrees/ordinances (what was nailed to the cross, Col 2:14; Eph 2:15)
- **Entalma** (G1778) = human religious precepts (what Jesus rebuked, Mat 15:9; Mrk 7:7; Col 2:22)

Revelation uses only entole for God's commands. Dogma never appears in Revelation. This vocabulary partition means the "commandments of God" in Revelation are categorically different from what was abolished at the cross.

## Connections Between Passages

### The Authority Chain

John 14:15,31; 15:10 establish a chain: The Father gives commandments -> Jesus keeps them -> Jesus transmits them as "my commandments" -> the disciples keep them. Revelation 12:17 and 14:12 extend this chain to the end-time remnant who "keep the commandments of God." The same entole vocabulary is used throughout, from the Father's commands to the remnant's obedience. The chain: Father -> Jesus -> disciples -> end-time saints.

### The Cosmic Conflict Framework

Daniel 7 and Revelation 12-14 share a narrative structure: a persecuting power attacks God's people and attempts to change God's law (Dan 7:25), while the saints are characterized by faithfulness to that law (Rev 12:17; 14:12). The time periods match (time, times, half a time = 1260 days = 42 months). The outcome also matches: judgment is given in favor of the saints (Dan 7:22; Rev 11:18; 20:4).

### The Ecc 12:13-14 / Rev 14:6-12 Structural Parallel

Both passages present the same three-element message:
1. Fear God (Ecc 12:13a / Rev 14:7a)
2. Keep his commandments (Ecc 12:13b / Rev 14:12)
3. God brings every work into judgment (Ecc 12:14 / Rev 14:7b)

The "conclusion of the whole matter" in the OT and the "everlasting gospel" in the NT contain the identical message.

### The Genesis-Revelation Bookend

Genesis opens with the tree of life accessible to humans (Gen 2:9), access lost through disobedience to God's command (Gen 3:22-24). Revelation closes with the tree of life accessible again (Rev 22:2,14), access granted through doing God's commandments. The Bible's narrative arc: command given -> command broken -> access lost -> redemption -> commandment-keeping restored -> access regained.

## Word Study Insights

### entole (G1785) — Commandment

The most critical word study for this analysis. Entole (ἐντολή) is the Greek word used in all three Revelation commandment passages (12:17; 14:12; 22:14 TR). Prior studies (law-20, law-21) established:
- 71 NT occurrences total
- When unqualified, entole refers to moral/Decalogue content in 43 of 43 identifiable instances
- When used in a ceremonial context, a qualifier is always present
- The Revelation instances are unqualified — therefore following the established pattern, they refer to moral/Decalogue content

### martyria (G3141) — Testimony

37 NT occurrences. In Revelation, "the testimony of Jesus" (martyria Iesou) is defined by Rev 19:10 as "the spirit of prophecy." The genitive construction is best read as subjective (the testimony that Jesus gives through prophetic revelation).

### pistis (G4102) — Faith

244 NT occurrences. In Rev 14:12, "the faith of Jesus" (pistin Iesou) parallels "the testimony of Jesus" in 12:17. Whether subjective (Jesus's own faithfulness) or objective (faith directed toward Jesus), the point is the same: the saints are marked by a faith-relationship with Jesus alongside commandment-keeping.

### hupomone (G5281) — Patience/Endurance

32 NT occurrences. In Revelation, hupomone characterizes the faithful under persecution (1:9; 2:2,19; 3:10; 13:10; 14:12). Rev 14:12 defines this endurance as commandment-keeping + faith — active obedience, not passive waiting.

### dogma (G1378) — Decree/Ordinance

5 NT occurrences. Used for what was "nailed to the cross" (Col 2:14) and "abolished" (Eph 2:15). Never used for God's moral commandments. Never appears in Revelation. This confirms the vocabulary partition: what was abolished (dogma) is categorically different from what the saints keep (entole).

### entalma (G1778) — Human Precept

3 NT occurrences. Used exclusively for "commandments of men" (Mat 15:9; Mrk 7:7; Col 2:22). Never for God's commands. A third distinct vocabulary term, further confirming that the NT distinguishes between categories of commands using different words.

## Difficult Passages

### The Genre Question: Apocalyptic Context

Revelation is apocalyptic literature, which raises the question of whether its commandment references should be read as symbolic rather than literal. However:
1. Rev 14:12 is a didactic statement within the apocalyptic framework. It is not part of a vision symbol — it is a direct characterization of the saints, introduced by "hode" (here is/this is).
2. Rev 12:17 similarly contains a defining description of the remnant. While the dragon and woman are symbolic, the description of what the remnant does ("keep the commandments of God") is definitional, not symbolic.
3. The vocabulary (entole) is used consistently across non-apocalyptic contexts (Gospels, Epistles) with the same meaning. The apocalyptic setting does not require a different referent for entole.
4. Gate 3 of Tree 3 notes that apocalyptic genre is a potential concern. However, the law-27 study already verified that these passages pass Gate 3 because the commandment-keeping statements are didactic content within an apocalyptic book, not symbolic imagery.

### Rev 22:14 Textual Variant

The N1904 reads "washing their robes" instead of "doing his commandments." This means:
1. The TR reading (entolas) is not universally attested in all manuscripts.
2. However, Rev 12:17 and 14:12 are not textually disputed — the entole language for commandment-keeping in Revelation is secure on at least two witnesses, irrespective of the Rev 22:14 variant.
3. Even the N1904 reading of Rev 22:14 ("washing robes") connects to the blood of the Lamb (Rev 7:14), which is a complementary rather than contradictory concept — the saints are both justified (washed in Christ's blood) and obedient (keep commandments).
4. The variant does not affect the overall pattern established by Rev 12:17 and 14:12.

### Does "Commandments of God" Mean Just the Decalogue?

One could argue that "commandments of God" includes all of God's commands, not specifically the Decalogue. However:
1. The entole vocabulary pattern (unqualified = moral/Decalogue in 43/43 instances) establishes the baseline referent.
2. The definite article (THE commandments) points to a recognized body of commands — the Decalogue is the body of commands designated "commandments of God" throughout Scripture.
3. The creation-worship language of Rev 14:7 specifically echoes the Fourth Commandment (Exo 20:11), embedding a Decalogue reference in the immediate context.
4. The sins listed in Rev 22:15 (murder, idolatry, lying) correspond to specific Decalogue violations (6th, 1st/2nd, 9th).
5. 1 Cor 7:19 uses the identical phrase "commandments of God" in a context where circumcision (ceremonial) is explicitly excluded — only moral commands remain.
6. This does not exclude additional divine instructions, but the Decalogue is the core referent.
