# What Commandments Are in Revelation?

**A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence**

---

The book of Revelation describes God's end-time people by two marks: they keep "the commandments of God" and they hold "the testimony of Jesus" or "the faith of Jesus." But what does "the commandments of God" actually mean in Revelation? Does it refer to the Ten Commandments? To some broader set of divine instructions? To the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels? This study examines every passage in Revelation that mentions commandments, traces the specific Greek vocabulary John uses, and compares it with how the same vocabulary is used throughout the rest of the New Testament.

## The Three Main Passages

Revelation contains three key passages where commandment-keeping defines God's people.

First, at the climax of the cosmic conflict described in Revelation 12, the dragon turns his fury on the last generation of believers:

> "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ." (Revelation 12:17)

Second, after the three angels' messages — the final warning to the world before Christ's return — the saints are identified by what sets them apart:

> "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." (Revelation 14:12)

Third, in the closing chapter of the Bible, a blessing is pronounced on those who obey:

> "Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city." (Revelation 22:14, Textus Receptus reading)

In each of these passages, the Greek word for "commandments" is entole (Strong's G1785), and in each case it appears with the definite article ("the commandments"), pointing to a specific, known body of commands — not vague or undefined instructions.

A note of honesty is necessary regarding the third passage: there is a textual variant at Revelation 22:14. Some Greek manuscript traditions read "washing their robes" instead of "doing his commandments." This means the verse's contribution depends on which manuscript tradition one follows. However, Revelation 12:17 and 14:12 are undisputed in all manuscript traditions, so the commandment-keeping pattern in Revelation rests securely on at least two clear witnesses regardless.

## What Does "Commandments" Mean Here?

The critical question is whether "commandments of God" means the Ten Commandments specifically or something broader. The answer emerges from how the New Testament uses the word entole throughout its pages.

When the New Testament writers wanted to refer to God's moral commands — the Ten Commandments — they used the word entole. When they referred to ceremonial regulations that were fulfilled in Christ, they used different words: dogma (for ordinances nailed to the cross) and entalma (for commandments of men). This vocabulary distinction is consistent across the entire New Testament.

Across every identifiable instance where entole appears without a qualifier (such as "commandments of men" or "carnal commandment"), it refers to moral or Decalogue content. When the word does carry a qualifier — like "fleshly" or "of men" — it takes on a different meaning, but those qualifiers are always present to signal the shift. In the Revelation passages, no such qualifier appears. John simply writes "the commandments of God."

Paul provides a particularly clear parallel. Using the identical Greek phrase — entolas tou theou, "commandments of God" — he writes:

> "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God." (1 Corinthians 7:19)

Here Paul explicitly sets aside circumcision (a ceremonial requirement) as "nothing" while affirming "the commandments of God" as what matters. The same phrase that appears in Revelation 12:17 and 14:12 is used in a context where the ceremonial law is specifically excluded.

Paul also identifies the word entole with a specific Decalogue command:

> "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." (Romans 7:12)

In the preceding verses, Paul identifies this "commandment" as "Thou shalt not covet" — the Tenth Commandment. So when Paul uses entole, he is talking about the moral law.

Jesus himself used the same word:

> "If ye love me, keep my commandments." (John 14:15)

> "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love." (John 15:10)

And John, the same author who wrote Revelation, stated plainly in his epistle:

> "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous." (1 John 5:3)

The vocabulary is consistent from Jesus's words in the upper room, through Paul's epistles, through John's letters, and into the book of Revelation. The same word is used, and it carries the same meaning.

## The Creation-Worship Echo

One of the most striking details in Revelation's commandment context is found in the first angel's message:

> "Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." (Revelation 14:7)

The phrase "made heaven, and earth, and the sea" directly echoes the language of the Fourth Commandment's rationale:

> "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it." (Exodus 20:11)

This is not a vague thematic similarity. The Greek text of Revelation 14:7 and the Greek translation of Exodus 20:11 share the same vocabulary: the verb for "made," plus "heaven," "earth," and "sea" in the same sequence. The first angel's message calls the world to worship the Creator using language drawn from the Sabbath commandment.

This creation-worship call stands in the immediate context of the commandment-keeping declaration in verse 12. The structural flow is: worship the Creator (verse 7), Babylon has fallen (verse 8), do not worship the beast (verses 9-11), and then: "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (verse 12). The commandment-keeping saints are placed in direct contrast with those who follow the beast's counterfeit worship.

## The Pattern Across Both Testaments

The pairing of "fear God," "keep commandments," and "judgment" is not unique to Revelation. The same triad appears at the conclusion of Ecclesiastes:

> "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." (Ecclesiastes 12:13-14)

The structural parallel is unmistakable: fear God, keep his commandments, face judgment. What Solomon declared as "the whole duty of man" in the Old Testament, the first angel proclaims to every nation in the last days. The commandment-keeping obligation spans from the wisdom literature of the Old Testament through to the final prophetic message before Christ's return.

## The Sins That Exclude

Revelation also defines who is shut out from the holy city:

> "For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie." (Revelation 22:15)

These exclusion sins correspond to specific Decalogue violations: murder (Sixth Commandment), idolatry (First and Second Commandments), and lying (Ninth Commandment). This further confirms that the moral content of the Ten Commandments is operative in Revelation's framework of judgment and salvation.

---

## The Dual Mark of God's People

A consistent pattern emerges across Revelation: commandment-keeping never appears alone. It is always paired with a second identifying mark.

In Revelation 12:17, "the commandments of God" is paired with "the testimony of Jesus Christ." In Revelation 14:12, "the commandments of God" is paired with "the faith of Jesus." In Revelation 22:14, commandment-doing is paired with "right to the tree of life."

Revelation 19:10 defines one of these companion terms:

> "The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." (Revelation 19:10)

The endurance of God's people in the last days, then, is defined as two things held together: obedience to God's moral commands and faithfulness connected to Jesus Christ. Neither element stands alone — together they form the complete identification of the remnant.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

Honest study requires acknowledging what the text does not explicitly state:

- **No verse in Revelation says, in so many words, "the commandments of God means the Ten Commandments."** The identification comes from the consistent vocabulary pattern across the New Testament and the Fourth Commandment echo in Revelation 14:7 — it is the clear direction of the evidence, but it is not stated in a single proof text.

- **No verse specifies that "times" in Daniel 7:25 refers to the Sabbath.** Daniel 7:25 predicts a power that will "think to change times and laws," but the word "times" could refer to the weekly Sabbath, annual feast days, or times in a more general sense. The text does not narrow it down.

- **No verse in Revelation explicitly lists all ten commandments by name.** The book references commandment-keeping as a whole and echoes specific commandments (the Fourth in 14:7, several in 22:15), but it does not recite the full Decalogue.

- **The textual variant at Revelation 22:14** means that one of the three commandment passages is not universally attested in all Greek manuscripts. The commandment-keeping identification of God's people does not depend on this single verse — Revelation 12:17 and 14:12 are sufficient — but the variant should be acknowledged.

## Conclusion

Revelation identifies God's end-time people as those who keep "the commandments of God" and hold "the faith of Jesus." The Greek word used for "commandments" in these passages is the same word used throughout the New Testament for the moral law — the Ten Commandments. Paul uses the identical phrase "commandments of God" in a context where ceremonial law is explicitly excluded. The first angel's message calls the world to worship the Creator in language drawn directly from the Fourth Commandment. The sins that bar people from the holy city correspond to Decalogue violations. And the vocabulary the New Testament uses for what was abolished at the cross is a different set of Greek words entirely — words that never appear in Revelation.

The Bible presents commandment-keeping not as legalism or an outdated obligation, but as the defining characteristic of God's faithful people at the end of time, held inseparably together with faith in Jesus Christ. What Solomon called "the whole duty of man" — fear God, keep his commandments, and face his judgment — is the same message the angels carry to every nation in Revelation's closing drama.
