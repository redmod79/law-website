## Question

What commandments are in Revelation and what do they mean? Does "commandments of God" (entolas tou theou) in Revelation refer to the Decalogue? Examine the dual identification marks of God's end-time people (commandments + faith/testimony of Jesus). Investigate the three angels' messages connection (Rev 14:6-12) and whether "commandments of God" in the context of end-time judgment points to the moral law.

## Summary Answer

Revelation identifies God's end-time people by a dual formula: keeping "the commandments of God" (tas entolas tou theou) and having "the testimony of Jesus" / "the faith of Jesus" (Rev 12:17; 14:12). The Greek word used is entole (G1785), which in the NT without a qualifier refers to moral/Decalogue content in 43 of 43 identifiable instances (established in law-20, law-21). The definite article marks a specific, known body of commands. The creation-worship language of Rev 14:7 echoes the Fourth Commandment's rationale (Exo 20:11), and the sins excluding people from the city (Rev 22:15) correspond to specific Decalogue violations. The vocabulary partition — entole for God's moral commands, dogma for what was abolished, entalma for human precepts — confirms that "commandments of God" in Revelation is categorically distinct from what was "nailed to the cross."

## Key Verses

**Revelation 12:17** -- "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."

**Revelation 14:7** -- "Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." (echoes Exo 20:11: "the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea" -- the Fourth Commandment's creation rationale)

**Revelation 14:12** -- "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."

**Revelation 22:14** -- "Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city." (TR reading)

**Revelation 19:10** -- "And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."

**1 Corinthians 7:19** -- "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."

**Ecclesiastes 12:13-14** -- "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil."

### Tree 3 Verification of Positional Classifications

**E1 (Rev 12:17) — Continues:**
- V1: "keep the commandments of God" — continuation vocabulary (commandments of God in Revelation). YES.
- Gate 1: "commandments of God" (entolas tou theou) identifies the referent as God's commandments. Entole unqualified = moral/Decalogue in 43/43 NT instances. PASS.
- Gate 2: terounton = present active participle; tas entolas = accusative plural with definite article; tou theou = genitive of source. Grammar is unambiguous. PASS.

## 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The three Revelation passages (Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14 TR) use the same Greek word (entole, G1785) for "commandments" and all three include the definite article (tas), marking a specific known body of commands. | E1, E2, E3 | Observable grammatical fact: terounton TAS entolas (12:17), terountes TAS entolas (14:12), poiountes TAS entolas (22:14). The same word with the same article in three passages. |
| N2 | Rev 14:7 and Exo 20:11 share the creation-worship phrase "made heaven, and earth, and the sea." This verbal parallel is observable. | E4 | The LXX of Exo 20:11 and the Greek of Rev 14:7 use the same vocabulary (poieo + ouranos + ge + thalassa). This is a textual fact both sides can verify. |
| N3 | Revelation pairs "commandments of God" with a second identification mark in every instance: testimony of Jesus (12:17), faith of Jesus (14:12), right to tree of life (22:14). The commandment references never stand alone. | E1, E2, E3 | In all three passages, commandment-keeping is paired with another element. No passage mentions commandments of God in isolation. Observable pattern. |
| N4 | The same Greek word entole (G1785) is used for "commandments" in Rev 12:17, 14:12, 22:14, Jhn 14:15, Jhn 15:10, 1 Jhn 5:3, 1 Cor 7:19, and Rom 7:12. | E1, E2, E3, E8, E9, E10, E11, E16 | Observable vocabulary fact: all these passages use the same Strong's number (G1785). |
| N5 | Rev 14:12 defines the patience (hupomone) of the saints as consisting of two things: keeping the commandments of God and holding the faith of Jesus. | E2 | The verse explicitly states "Here is the patience of the saints" and then defines it with the two clauses that follow. This is what the text says. |

## 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | "Commandments of God" in Revelation refers specifically to the Decalogue (Ten Commandments), including the Sabbath. | I-A | E1-E3 state "commandments of God" using entole (G1785). E4 echoes the Fourth Commandment's creation language. E6 lists Decalogue violations as exclusion sins. E8 (1 Cor 7:19) uses the identical phrase while excluding circumcision (ceremonial). E16 (Rom 7:12) identifies entole as the Tenth Commandment. N4 shows the same word is used for Decalogue content across the NT. N097 (master) states entole unqualified = moral/Decalogue in 43/43 instances. | All components are found in E/N tables. This is an inference only because it systematizes the entole distribution pattern, the creation-worship echo, and the Decalogue-violation list into a single identification. No single verse says "the commandments of God in Revelation = the Decalogue." | #5 (systematizing multiple E/N items) |
| I2 | "Commandments of God" in Revelation could refer to any divine instruction (not specifically the Decalogue) — perhaps new covenant commands, the "law of Christ," or the full Mosaic law as a unit. | I-B | E1-E3 use the phrase "commandments of God" without specifying "Decalogue." E13 notes nomos does not appear in Revelation, so direct "law" debates from Paul's epistles cannot be imported. | This requires the phrase "commandments of God" to have a referent other than what entole unqualified refers to in all 43 other identifiable NT instances (N097). It requires E/N items about the entole vocabulary pattern to mean something other than their lexical value. Some E/N items support it (E13 — nomos absent); most E/N items on entole usage conflict with it. | #1 (adding concept: "commandments of God" = something other than the Decalogue), #2 (choosing between readings of entole) |
| I3 | The three angels' messages (Rev 14:6-12) constitute a restoration of true worship in contrast to false beast-worship, with the creation-worship call (Rev 14:7) specifically recalling the Sabbath commandment. | I-A | E4 (Rev 14:7 echoes Exo 20:11 creation language). E2 (Rev 14:12 identifies commandment-keepers). E340 (master: Fourth Commandment cites creation as Sabbath rationale). N2 (verbal parallel is observable). The first angel calls for worship of the Creator; the third angel warns against beast worship; v.12 defines the true worshippers as commandment-keepers. | All components are found in E/N tables. This is an inference because it systematizes the three angels' messages into a unified worship-restoration framework, connecting the creation language to the Fourth Commandment specifically. | #5 (systematizing), #4a (SIS: Rev 14:7 interpreted by Exo 20:11 via verified verbal parallel) |
| I4 | The "commandments of God" in Revelation should not be taken as referring to specific OT commands because Revelation is apocalyptic literature, and apocalyptic genre uses symbolic imagery that should not be read as literal moral instruction. | I-D | E1-E3 use entole in Revelation, which is apocalyptic genre. E13 notes nomos is absent from Revelation. However, E1-E3 are didactic characterizations within the apocalyptic framework (E2 is introduced by "hode," a didactic marker). N097 shows entole has the same referent across apocalyptic and non-apocalyptic contexts. | This requires importing an external hermeneutical principle (apocalyptic genre overrides lexical meaning) that the text itself does not state. The text uses the same word (entole) with the same grammatical features as non-apocalyptic passages. This overrides E/N statements about what entole means. | #3 (external framework: genre hermeneutic requiring apocalyptic = non-literal), #1 (adds concept that apocalyptic context changes the referent of entole) |
| I5 | The Ecc 12:13-14 / Rev 14:6-12 structural parallel (Fear God + Keep Commandments + Judgment) demonstrates an unbroken commandment-keeping obligation from OT through to the end-time gospel. | I-A | E7 (Ecc 12:13-14: Fear God + keep commandments + judgment). E2 (Rev 14:12: keep commandments of God). E4 (Rev 14:7: fear God + judgment). N4 (same word entole used in both testaments). The triad appears in both passages using the same conceptual elements. | All components are in E/N tables. This is an inference because it systematizes the parallel into a claim about unbroken obligation. The texts individually state their own commands; the inference connects them across testaments. | #5 (systematizing), #4a (SIS: structural parallel verified by shared vocabulary and conceptual elements) |
| I6 | The vocabulary partition (entole = moral, dogma = abolished, entalma = human precepts) demonstrates that the NT itself distinguishes between categories of commands, and what Revelation's saints keep (entole) is categorically different from what was abolished (dogma). | I-A | E8 (1 Cor 7:19: entole affirmed, circumcision dismissed). E13 (nomos absent from Revelation, entole used). N097 (entole unqualified = moral in 43/43 instances). N102 (NT vocabulary in affirmation passages = entole; in cessation passages = dogma). I048 (master: dogma + cheirographon form a distinct cessation vocabulary). The three Greek words have non-overlapping distributions. | All components from E/N tables. This systematizes multiple vocabulary observations into a category-distinction claim. Each individual observation is E or N; the synthesis is an inference because it draws a conclusion about distinct law categories from the vocabulary data. | #5 (systematizing) |
| I7 | Daniel 7:25 ("think to change times and laws") predicts an attempt to alter God's commandments, and Rev 12:17's remnant who "keep the commandments of God" are those who resist this alteration, confirming the Sabbath is specifically at stake (the only commandment involving "times"). | I-B | E12 (Dan 7:25: power thinks to change times and laws). E1 (Rev 12:17: remnant keeps commandments). The time period in Dan 7:25 ("time, times, half a time") matches Rev 12:14 exactly. The word "times" (Aramaic zimniyn) in Dan 7:25 could refer to the Sabbath ("the only commandment involving times") or to feast times. | This systematizes the Dan 7-Rev 12 connection and then identifies "times" specifically with the Sabbath. The Sabbath identification requires choosing "times" = weekly Sabbath rather than festival calendar or generic times. E/N items support both the connection (matching time periods) and the commandment-keeping context, but E/N items do not specify WHICH commandment's "times" are targeted. | #2 (choosing between possible readings of "times"), #5 (systematizing) |

## I-B Resolution

### I-B Resolution: I2 — "Commandments of God" = generic divine instruction (not Decalogue)

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR I2: E13 (nomos absent from Revelation — the "law" debates in Paul cannot be directly imported). The phrase "commandments of God" is not itself limited to ten.
- AGAINST I2: E1-E3 (all use entole, G1785). E4 (creation-worship echo of Fourth Commandment). E6 (excluded sins = Decalogue violations). E8 (1 Cor 7:19 uses identical phrase while excluding ceremonial). E16 (Paul identifies entole as Tenth Commandment). N097 (master: entole unqualified = moral/Decalogue in 43/43 instances). N100 (Paul distinguishes entole from circumcision). N102 (NT vocabulary in affirmation = entole).

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E1 (Rev 12:17) | Contextually Clear | Uses entole + definite article + genitive of God. Apocalyptic context requires genre awareness, but the vocabulary is consistent with non-apocalyptic usage. |
| E2 (Rev 14:12) | Contextually Clear | Same construction. Introduced by didactic hode marker. |
| E3 (Rev 22:14 TR) | Contextually Clear | Same entole vocabulary. Textual variant affects certainty. |
| E4 (Rev 14:7) | Contextually Clear | Verbal echo of Exo 20:11 requires recognizing the allusion. |
| E8 (1 Cor 7:19) | Plain | Directly addresses the topic: "commandments of God" affirmed while ceremonial (circumcision) dismissed. Didactic epistle. No interpretation needed. |
| E16 (Rom 7:12, 7) | Plain | Paul identifies entole as the Tenth Commandment explicitly. |
| N097 | Plain | Observable distribution pattern: 43/43 unqualified entole = moral/Decalogue. |
| E13 (nomos absent) | Plain | Observable vocabulary fact. |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
AGAINST I2: 3 Plain items (E8, E16, N097) + 4 Contextually Clear items (E1, E2, E3, E4).
FOR I2: 1 Plain item (E13) — but E13 is a vocabulary observation that does not itself argue for a different referent. It simply notes nomos is absent. The absence of nomos does not require entole to mean something different from what it means everywhere else.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
The Plain statements (E8, E16, N097) determine the reading of the Contextually Clear ones. E8 (1 Cor 7:19) uses the identical phrase "commandments of God" (entolas tou theou) in a non-apocalyptic, didactic context where ceremonial content is explicitly excluded. N097 demonstrates the entole distribution pattern across all NT contexts. These plain statements govern the reading of the Revelation instances.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Strong**
Plain statements on the AGAINST side (E8, E16, N097) demonstrate that "commandments of God" using entole unqualified refers to moral/Decalogue content. The FOR side has only E13 (vocabulary observation that nomos is absent), which is neutral regarding what entole means. The resolution is Strong in favor of the Decalogue identification.

---

### I-B Resolution: I7 — Dan 7:25 "times" = Sabbath specifically

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR I7: E12 (Dan 7:25: "think to change times and laws"). E1 (Rev 12:17: remnant keeps commandments). The matching time periods (Dan 7:25 = Rev 12:14). The Sabbath is the only weekly-recurring commandment involving a specific "time."
- AGAINST I7: "Times" (zimniyn) could refer to festival times, appointed seasons, or generic times/seasons. The text does not specify which laws or which times.

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E12 (Dan 7:25) | Ambiguous | The text says "times and laws" without specifying which times or which laws. Both weekly and annual times are possible referents. |
| E1 (Rev 12:17) | Contextually Clear | Uses entole for commandments, which is clear, but does not mention "times." |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
The key item (E12) is Ambiguous. No Plain statement specifies that "times" in Dan 7:25 = the weekly Sabbath specifically.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
No Plain statement resolves the ambiguity of "times" in Dan 7:25. The Sabbath is one possible referent among others (festival calendar, prophetic times).

**Step 5 — Resolution: Unresolved**
The connection between Dan 7:25 and the Sabbath specifically cannot be established from E/N items alone. The claim remains an inference.

## 4. Analysis of Key Passages

### Rev 12:17 — The Dragon's War Against Commandment-Keepers

The closing verse of Revelation 12 identifies the dragon's final target: "the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ." The Greek grammar confirms:
- terounton (present active participle, genitive plural) = ongoing characteristic action
- tas entolas tou theou = THE commandments OF GOD (specific, known body; divine source)
- ten martyrian Iesou = THE testimony OF JESUS (defined in Rev 19:10 as "the spirit of prophecy")

The cosmic conflict context places commandment-keeping as the issue over which the dragon wars. This aligns with Dan 7:25 where the opposing power "thinks to change times and laws."

### Rev 14:12 — The Patience of the Saints Defined

Positioned after the three angels' messages (14:6-11), this verse defines the endurance of the saints as two things: keeping the commandments of God and holding the faith of Jesus. The structural placement is significant:
- First angel (v.7): worship the Creator (echoes Exo 20:11)
- Second angel (v.8): Babylon is fallen
- Third angel (vv.9-11): warning against beast worship
- v.12: the saints keep God's commandments and have Jesus's faith

The creation-worship language of v.7 verbally echoes the Fourth Commandment, embedding a Decalogue reference in the immediate context of the commandment-keeping declaration.

### Rev 22:14 — Commandments and the Tree of Life (TR)

The beatitude links commandment-doing to access to the tree of life, reversing the Genesis 3 exclusion. The textual variant (N1904: "washing their robes" vs. TR: "doing his commandments") means this verse's contribution depends on text-critical decisions. However, Rev 12:17 and 14:12 are undisputed, making the commandment-keeping pattern in Revelation secure on at least two witnesses.

## 5. Word Study Summary

| Word | Strong's | Key Finding |
|------|----------|-------------|
| entole | [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | Used in all three Revelation commandment passages. Unqualified = moral/Decalogue in 43/43 identifiable NT instances. Qualified (with sarkines, en dogmasin, anthropon) = ceremonial or human. No qualifier in Revelation instances. |
| martyria | [G3141](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3141/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | "Testimony of Jesus" defined in Rev 19:10 as "the spirit of prophecy." Subjective genitive: the testimony Jesus gives. |
| pistis | [G4102](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4102/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | "Faith of Jesus" in Rev 14:12. Whether subjective (Jesus's faithfulness) or objective (faith in Jesus), it pairs with commandment-keeping. |
| hupomone | [G5281](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5281/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | "Patience/endurance" of the saints. Defined in Rev 14:12 as commandment-keeping + faith. Active obedience, not passive waiting. |
| dogma | [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | Used for what was "nailed to the cross" (Col 2:14) and "abolished" (Eph 2:15). Never for God's moral commands. Never appears in Revelation. |
| entalma | [G1778](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1778/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | Used exclusively for "commandments of men" (Mat 15:9; Mrk 7:7; Col 2:22). Third distinct term, confirming NT vocabulary distinguishes command categories. |
| nomos | [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | Does not appear in Revelation. The "law" debates in Paul's epistles cannot be directly imported into Revelation's "commandments" language. |

## 6. Position Evaluation

### Continues Position Assessment

The Continues position holds that "commandments of God" in Revelation refers to the moral law (Decalogue), which remains binding on end-time believers.

**Evidence supporting this position:**
- E1, E2, E3: Three explicit Revelation passages use entole for God's commandments
- E4: Creation-worship language echoing the Fourth Commandment
- E7: Ecc 12:13-14 parallel (Fear God + commandments + judgment)
- E8: Identical phrase "commandments of God" in 1 Cor 7:19 with ceremonial explicitly excluded
- E9, E10, E11: John's Gospel and epistles use same entole vocabulary for Jesus's/God's commandments
- E16: Paul identifies entole as the Tenth Commandment
- N097 (master): Entole unqualified = moral/Decalogue in 43/43 instances
- N100, N102 (master): Vocabulary partition supports moral/ceremonial distinction
- I1 (I-A): Decalogue identification systematizes all E/N data
- I3 (I-A): Three angels' messages as creation-worship restoration
- I5 (I-A): Ecc-Rev structural parallel demonstrates continuity
- I6 (I-A): Vocabulary partition (entole vs. dogma vs. entalma) supports law-category distinction

**Evidence tier:** 10 E-items (Continues) + 5 N-items (3 Neutral, 2 Continues from master DB) + 4 I-A inferences (Continues).

### Abolished Position Assessment

The Abolished position holds that "commandments of God" in Revelation does not refer specifically to the Decalogue, or that the Decalogue was abolished and the phrase means something else.

**Evidence supporting this position:**
- E13: Nomos absent from Revelation (the "law" debates in Paul may not apply directly)
- I2 (I-B): "Commandments of God" could mean generic divine instruction
- I4 (I-D): Apocalyptic genre should not be read as literal moral instruction

**Evidence tier:** 1 E-item (Neutral — E13 is a vocabulary fact, not positional) + 1 I-B (resolved Strong against) + 1 I-D.

### Assessment

The Continues position has multiple E-tier items and N-tier items, plus I-A inferences that systematize only the text's own data. The Abolished position has no E-tier items classified as Abolished (E13 is Neutral), one I-B inference that resolved Strong against it, and one I-D inference that requires overriding the established meaning of entole with an external genre principle. The evidence hierarchy (E > N > I-A > I-B > I-C > I-D) places the Continues position's evidence at higher tiers than the Abolished position's evidence.

## 8. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

**What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):**
- Revelation identifies God's end-time people as those who "keep the commandments of God" (Rev 12:17; 14:12) using the Greek word entole (G1785)
- The same word (entole) is used across the NT for moral/Decalogue commandments, with a qualifier always present in ceremonial contexts
- The creation-worship language of Rev 14:7 verbally echoes the Fourth Commandment's rationale (Exo 20:11)
- The "testimony of Jesus" is defined as "the spirit of prophecy" (Rev 19:10)
- The patience of the saints consists of keeping God's commandments and holding the faith of Jesus (Rev 14:12)
- The sins excluding people from the holy city (Rev 22:15) include violations of specific Decalogue commands
- The phrase "commandments of God" (entolas tou theou) is used identically in 1 Cor 7:19 where Paul explicitly excludes ceremonial content (circumcision)
- "Fear God + keep commandments + judgment" is a pattern spanning Ecc 12:13-14 and Rev 14:6-12

**What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):**
- No verse in Revelation says "the commandments of God = the Ten Commandments" in those exact words (though the entole vocabulary pattern and the Fourth Commandment echo in Rev 14:7 make the Decalogue identification the systematization of textual data, not an external imposition)
- No verse specifies that "times" in Dan 7:25 refers to the Sabbath specifically (versus festival times or generic times)
- The textual variant at Rev 22:14 means the "doing his commandments" reading is not unanimously attested in all manuscript traditions
- No verse in Revelation explicitly lists all ten commandments by name

## Conclusion

Across the three primary Revelation passages (Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14 TR), "commandments of God" uses the Greek word entole (G1785) with the definite article, marking a specific known body of divine commands. The NT entole vocabulary pattern — unqualified = moral/Decalogue content in 43 of 43 identifiable instances — applies to the Revelation instances, which bear no qualifier. The identical phrase "commandments of God" (entolas tou theou) appears in 1 Cor 7:19 where Paul explicitly excludes ceremonial content. The creation-worship language of Rev 14:7 verbally parallels Exo 20:11, the Fourth Commandment's rationale. The excluded sins in Rev 22:15 correspond to Decalogue violations.

This study produced 17 explicit statements (10 Continues, 7 Neutral, 0 Abolished), 5 necessary implications (all Neutral), and 7 inferences (4 I-A Continues, 1 I-B Continues [resolved Strong], 1 I-B Abolished [resolved Strong against], 1 I-D Abolished). No explicit statement or necessary implication supports the Abolished position on this topic. The Abolished position's claims (I2, I4) are classified at the inference level and resolve against in the I-B Resolution analysis.
