### Definition
From [G1781](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1781/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (entellomai); injunction, i.e. an authoritative prescription

### Key Occurrences in Revelation
- **Rev 12:17** -- "keep the commandments (tas entolas) of God"
- **Rev 14:12** -- "keep the commandments (tas entolas) of God"
- **Rev 22:14** -- "do his commandments (tas entolas autou)" [TR reading]

### Key Occurrences Elsewhere
- **Mat 19:17** -- "keep the commandments" (Jesus lists Decalogue)
- **Jhn 14:15** -- "keep my commandments"
- **Jhn 15:10** -- "keep my commandments...my Father's commandments"
- **Rom 7:8-13** -- "the commandment" (identified as 10th commandment)
- **Rom 13:9** -- Paul lists Decalogue commands under entole
- **1 Cor 7:19** -- "the keeping of the commandments of God"
- **1 Jhn 2:3-4** -- "keep his commandments"
- **1 Jhn 3:22-24** -- "keep his commandments"
- **1 Jhn 5:2-3** -- "keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous"
- **2 Jhn 1:4-6** -- "walk after his commandments"
- **Eph 2:15** -- "the law of commandments contained in ordinances" (qualified: en dogmasin)
- **Heb 7:16** -- "the law of a carnal commandment" (qualified: sarkines)
- **Tit 1:14** -- "commandments of men" (qualified: anthropon)

### Distribution Pattern (from prior studies law-20, law-21)
When entole appears **unqualified** (without a modifier specifying a category), it refers to moral/Decalogue content in 43/43 identifiable NT instances. When used in a ceremonial context, a **qualifier is always present** (en dogmasin in Eph 2:15, sarkines in Heb 7:16, anthropon in Tit 1:14). This is a complete distribution pattern.

## [G3141](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3141/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- martyria (testimony, witness, evidence)

**Greek:** μαρτυρία
**Transliteration:** martyria
**Pronunciation:** mar-too-ree-ah
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 37 NT occurrences
**Strong's Translation DB:** 16 occurrences tracked, 5 unique translations

### Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| testimony | 9 | 56.2% |
| witness | 4 | 25.0% |
| for witness | 1 | 6.2% |
| their witness | 1 | 6.2% |
| report | 1 | 6.2% |

### Definition
From [G3144](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3144/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (martys); evidence given (judicially or generally): record, report, testimony, witness.

### Key Occurrences in Revelation
- **Rev 1:2** -- "the testimony (martyrian) of Jesus Christ"
- **Rev 1:9** -- "for the testimony (martyrian) of Jesus Christ"
- **Rev 6:9** -- "for the testimony (martyrian) which they held"
- **Rev 11:7** -- "finished their testimony (martyrian)"
- **Rev 12:11** -- "by the word of their testimony (martyrias)"
- **Rev 12:17** -- "have the testimony (martyrian) of Jesus"
- **Rev 19:10** -- "the testimony (martyria) of Jesus **is** the spirit of prophecy"
- **Rev 20:4** -- "for the witness (martyrian) of Jesus"

### Genitive Construction: martyrian Iesou
In Rev 12:17, 19:10, and 20:4, the genitive "Iesou" (of Jesus) could be:
- **Subjective genitive:** The testimony that Jesus gives (Jesus as source of testimony)
- **Objective genitive:** The testimony about Jesus (Jesus as content of testimony)
- **Possessive genitive:** The testimony belonging to Jesus

Rev 19:10 provides a defining statement: "the testimony of Jesus **is** the spirit of prophecy" (he gar martyria Iesou estin to pneuma tes propheteias). The verb estin (is) equates the testimony of Jesus with the spirit of prophecy, which supports a subjective reading (the testimony that Jesus gives through prophetic revelation).

## [G4102](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4102/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- pistis (faith, persuasion, credence)

**Greek:** πίστις
**Transliteration:** pistis
**Pronunciation:** pis-tis
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 244 NT occurrences
**Strong's Translation DB:** 222 occurrences tracked, 17 unique translations

### Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| faith | 153 | 68.9% |
| of faith | 22 | 9.9% |
| By faith | 15 | 6.8% |
| the faith | 10 | 4.5% |
| by faith | 6 | 2.7% |
| assurance | 1 | 0.5% |
| belief | 1 | 0.5% |
| fidelity | 1 | 0.5% |

### Definition
From [G3982](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3982/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (peitho); persuasion, i.e. credence; moral conviction (of religious truth).

### Key Occurrences in Revelation
- **Rev 2:13** -- "hast not denied my faith (pistin)"
- **Rev 2:19** -- "I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith (pistin)"
- **Rev 13:10** -- "Here is the patience and the faith (pistis) of the saints"
- **Rev 14:12** -- "the faith (pistin) of Jesus"

### Genitive Construction: pistin Iesou
In Rev 14:12, "the faith of Jesus" (ten pistin Iesou) could be:
- **Subjective genitive:** The faith that Jesus himself had/has (the faithfulness of Jesus)
- **Objective genitive:** Faith in Jesus (faith directed toward Jesus)

The same construction "pistis Iesou Christou" appears in Gal 2:16, Rom 3:22, and Phil 3:9. This is a debated construction in NT scholarship. The parallel with Rev 13:10 ("the faith of the saints") -- where saints are the ones exercising faith -- may suggest the objective genitive reading (faith in Jesus). However, the parallel with Rev 12:17 where "testimony of Jesus" is paired with "commandments of God" (both using genitive of person + noun) may suggest a consistent subjective reading.

## [G5281](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5281/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- hupomone (patience, endurance, constancy)

**Greek:** ὑπομονή
**Transliteration:** hupomone
**Pronunciation:** hoop-om-on-ay
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 32 NT occurrences
**Strong's Translation DB:** 29 occurrences tracked, 7 unique translations

### Translations

| of patience | 2 | 6.9% |
| patient continuance | 1 | 3.4% |
| the enduring | 1 | 3.4% |
| the patient waiting | 1 | 3.4% |

### Definition
From [G5278](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5278/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (hupomeno); cheerful (or hopeful) endurance, constancy.

### Key Occurrences in Revelation
- **Rev 1:9** -- "patience (hupomone) of Jesus Christ"
- **Rev 2:2** -- "thy patience (hupomonen)"
- **Rev 2:19** -- "faith, and thy patience (hupomonen)"
- **Rev 3:10** -- "the word of my patience (hupomones)"
- **Rev 13:10** -- "the patience (hupomone) and the faith of the saints"
- **Rev 14:12** -- "the patience (hupomone) of the saints"

### Significance
In Revelation, hupomone characterizes the saints under end-time persecution. Rev 14:12 defines what this endurance consists of: keeping the commandments of God AND holding the faith of Jesus. The endurance is not passive suffering but active obedience under pressure.

## [G2003](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2003/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- epitage (injunction, decree, authority)

**Greek:** ἐπιταγή
**Transliteration:** epitage
**Pronunciation:** ep-ee-tag-ay
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 7 NT occurrences

### Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| commandment | 3 | 42.9% |
| the commandment | 2 | 28.6% |
| to the commandment | 1 | 14.3% |
| authority | 1 | 14.3% |

### Definition
From [G2004](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2004/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (epitasso); an injunction or decree; by implication, authority.

### Key Occurrences
- Rom 16:26 -- "according to the commandment of the everlasting God"
- 1 Cor 7:6 -- "by permission, and not of commandment"
- 1 Cor 7:25 -- "I have no commandment of the Lord"
- Tit 1:3 -- "according to the commandment of God our Saviour"
- Tit 2:15 -- "with all authority"

### Contrast with entole
Epitage is used for apostolic authority or divine decrees in general, NOT for moral commandments. It is NEVER used in Revelation. The consistent Revelation word for commandments is entole (G1785).

## [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- dogma (decree, ordinance)

**Greek:** δόγμα
**Transliteration:** dogma
**Pronunciation:** dog-mah
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**BLB Count:** 5 NT occurrences

### Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| decrees | 2 | 40.0% |
| a decree | 1 | 20.0% |
| ordinances | 1 | 20.0% |
| of ordinances | 1 | 20.0% |

### Definition
From [G1380](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1380/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dokeo); a law (civil, ceremonial or ecclesiastical).

### Key Occurrences
- Luk 2:1 -- "a decree from Caesar Augustus"
- Act 16:4 -- "the decrees that were ordained of the apostles"
- Act 17:7 -- "the decrees of Caesar"
- **Eph 2:15** -- "the law of commandments contained in ordinances (dogmasin)"
- **Col 2:14** -- "the handwriting of ordinances (dogmasin)"

### Significance for This Study
Dogma is the word used for what was "nailed to the cross" (Col 2:14) and "abolished" (Eph 2:15). It is NEVER used for God's moral commandments. In all 5 NT occurrences, it refers to human decrees (Caesar's, apostles') or to ceremonial ordinances that were abolished. This contrasts with entole (G1785), which IS used for God's moral commandments.

**The vocabulary partition:** What is abolished = dogma. What God's people keep in Revelation = entole. These are two different Greek words for two different categories of commands.

## [G1778](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1778/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- entalma (commandment, precept of men)

**Greek:** ἔνταλμα
**Transliteration:** entalma
**Pronunciation:** en-tal-mah
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**BLB Count:** 3 NT occurrences

### Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| the commandments | 2 | 66.7% |
| commandments | 1 | 33.3% |

### Key Occurrences
- **Mat 15:9** -- "teaching [for] doctrines the commandments (entalmata) of men"
- **Mrk 7:7** -- "teaching [for] doctrines the commandments (entalmata) of men"
- **Col 2:22** -- "after the commandments (entalmata) and doctrines of men"

### Significance
Entalma is used EXCLUSIVELY for "commandments of men" -- human religious regulations. It is NEVER used for God's commands. This is a third distinct vocabulary term:
- **Entole** = God's moral commands (what Revelation's saints keep)
- **Dogma** = decrees/ordinances (what was nailed to the cross)
- **Entalma** = human religious precepts (what Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for following)

## [G4394](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4394/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- propheteia (prophecy, prediction)

**Greek:** προφητεία
**Transliteration:** propheteia
**Pronunciation:** prof-ay-ti-ah
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 19 NT occurrences

### Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| prophecy | 11 | 57.9% |
| prophesying | 2 | 10.5% |
| prophecies | 1 | 5.3% |
| prophesyings | 1 | 5.3% |

### Key Occurrences
- **Rev 1:3** -- "the words of this prophecy (propheteias)"
- **Rev 11:6** -- "the days of their prophecy (propheteias)"
- **Rev 19:10** -- "the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy (propheteias)"
- **Rev 22:7** -- "the sayings of the prophecy (propheteias) of this book"
- **Rev 22:10** -- "the sayings of the prophecy (propheteias) of this book"
- **Rev 22:18** -- "the words of the prophecy (propheteias) of this book"
- **Rev 22:19** -- "the book of this prophecy (propheteias)"

### Significance
Rev 19:10 is the key verse connecting testimony (martyria) with prophecy (propheteia): "the testimony of Jesus IS the spirit of prophecy." This defines what "the testimony of Jesus" means in Rev 12:17 -- it is the prophetic witness/spirit that Jesus gives. The word propheteia appears 7 times in Revelation, more than any other NT book.

## [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- nomos (law)

**Greek:** νόμος
**Transliteration:** nomos
**Pronunciation:** nom-os
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 197 NT occurrences
**Strong's Translation DB:** 169 occurrences tracked, 11 unique translations

### Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| law | 95 | 56.2% |
| the law | 49 | 29.0% |
| of the law | 14 | 8.3% |

### Significance for This Study
Nomos (law) does NOT appear in Revelation. The book uses entole (commandment) instead. This is a significant vocabulary choice:
- Paul uses nomos extensively (Romans alone has 74 occurrences)
- Revelation uses entole exclusively for God's commandments
- The absence of nomos in Revelation means the "law" debates in Paul's epistles do not directly apply to Revelation's "commandments of God" language

- **ten** = definite article, accusative singular feminine
- **martyrian** = testimony, accusative singular feminine
- **Iesou** = Jesus, genitive singular masculine
- Genitive "Iesou" = likely subjective (testimony Jesus gives) based on Rev 19:10 definition

### "ten pistin Iesou" (the faith of Jesus) -- Rev 14:12
- **ten** = definite article, accusative singular feminine
- **pistin** = faith, accusative singular feminine
- **Iesou** = Jesus, genitive singular masculine
- Genitive "Iesou" = could be subjective (faithfulness of Jesus) or objective (faith in Jesus)
- Parallel with "tas entolas tou theou" (genitive of person + noun) in same verse

### Rev 22:14 Textual Variant (N1904 vs TR)
- **N1904 (Nestle/Critical Text):** "makarioi hoi plunontes tas stolas auton" = "Blessed are those washing their robes"
  - plunontes (G4150) = washing; stolas (G4749) = robes
- **TR (Textus Receptus/KJV):** "makarioi hoi poiountes tas entolas autou" = "Blessed are those doing his commandments"
  - poiountes (G4160) = doing; entolas (G1785) = commandments
- **Variant:** Strong's numbers unique to N1904: [G4150](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4150/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (wash), [G4749](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4749/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (robes); unique to TR: [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (commandments)
- The KJV follows the TR reading. Both readings connect to access to the tree of life.

### Participle Usage: terounton/terountes (keeping)
- **Rev 12:17:** terounton (G5083) = present active participle, genitive plural masculine -- "the ones keeping" (characterizing description of the remnant)
- **Rev 14:12:** terountes (G5083) = present active participle, nominative plural masculine -- "the ones keeping" (identifying description of the saints)
- Present tense participle = ongoing, continuous action. Not a one-time act but habitual/characteristic keeping.
