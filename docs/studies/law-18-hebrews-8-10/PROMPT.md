# law-18: Hebrews 8-10 -- Priesthood, Covenant, and Law

## Study Question

What do Hebrews 8-10 teach about priesthood, covenant, and law? Investigate as a cohesive unit: the new High Priest (Heb 8:1-6), the first covenant's "faultless" question (8:7-8), the full quotation of Jer 31:31-34 (8:8-12), "he hath made the first old" and "that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away" (8:13), the earthly sanctuary as "shadow" and "figure" (9:1-10), "carnal ordinances imposed until the time of reformation" (9:10), Christ's better sacrifice (9:11-28), "the law having a shadow of good things to come" (10:1), "he taketh away the first, that he may establish the second" (10:9), and then 10:16 "I will put my laws into their hearts" -- writing the law on hearts AFTER describing what was taken away. What specifically is the "shadow"? What are the "carnal ordinances"? What is "taken away" vs what is "established"?

## Law Series Context

This is study 18 in a 31-study series on the Law of God. The series investigates whether God's moral law (Ten Commandments, including Sabbath) continues or was abolished at the cross. Both positions agree ceremonial/civil laws ceased -- the debate is ONLY about the moral law.

## Prior Study Findings (from Study DB)

### Heavily Analyzed Passages

Hebrews 8-10 has been examined in multiple prior studies. The research agent must be aware of these findings to avoid duplication while also extending the analysis as a cohesive three-chapter unit (which has NOT been done before).

**law-09 (Old Covenant / New Covenant):** Examined Heb 8:1-13, 9:1-10, 10:1-18 within the covenant question. Key findings:
- Heb 8:8 "finding fault with THEM (autous)" -- Greek masculine accusative = the people, not the law (E274)
- Heb 8:10 "my laws (nomous mou)" -- possessive pronoun identifies God's existing laws (E039)
- Heb 8:13 "made the first old...vanish away" -- neuter participles do not agree with diatheke (feminine); classified E275 Neutral
- Heb 9:1 "ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary" -- specifies first covenant's practical content (E276)
- Heb 9:10 "carnal ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation" -- already registered as E136
- Heb 10:9 "taketh away the first...establish the second" -- context identifies "the first" as sacrifices (E278)
- Heb 10:16 "my laws into their hearts" -- second quotation of Jer 31:33 (E039)
- I-B Resolution on Heb 8:13: Resolved "Strong against Abolished" via SIS -- plain statements in same chapter (Heb 8:8, 10) and immediate context (Heb 9:1, 10) interpret the ambiguous "vanishing"
- Pattern identified: Hebrews 10:1-17 removes sacrificial system while affirming "my laws" on hearts in same argument (N044)

**law-08 (Abolished at Cross):** Examined Heb 9:10 and Heb 10:1-9 as two of seven NT abolition passages. Key findings:
- All seven abolition passages use different Greek vocabulary; none explicitly names the Decalogue (N1/N043)
- Heb 9:10: dikaiomata sarkos = "carnal ordinances" explicitly identified as "meats, drinks, washings" (E136)
- Heb 10:1: "the law" that has "a shadow" is defined by its content -- "those sacrifices" (E056)
- Heb 10:9: "the first" taken away = "sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings" (E133)
- Heb 10:16: After removing sacrifices, the author quotes Jer 31:33 "my laws into their hearts" (E039)
- Vocabulary comparison: dogma (G1378) used in abolition texts, never for Decalogue; cheirographon (G5498) = hand-written, Decalogue = God-written

**law-04 (Ceremonial Laws):** Examined the "shadow" vocabulary and sanctuary service in depth. Key findings:
- skia (G4639) applied to ceremonial system in three passages: Heb 10:1, Col 2:17, Heb 8:5. Never applied to the moral law/Decalogue
- dikaioma (G1345) in Heb 9:1, 10 explicitly modified by "of divine service" and "carnal" -- limited to sanctuary/ceremonial
- Heb 8:5 "pattern/example" = hupodeigma (G5262) applied to earthly sanctuary service
- Five categories of ceremonial law all delivered through Moses, written by Moses in a book, placed beside the Ark

**law-11 (Written on Hearts):** Examined the Jer 31:33 / Heb 8:10 / 10:16 "my law" chain. Key findings:
- Possessive pronoun chain: Jer 31:33 "MY law (torati)" -> Heb 8:10 "MY laws (nomous mou)" -> Heb 10:16 "MY laws (nomous mou)"
- The Psalm 40 / Hebrews 10 connection: Psa 40:6-8 contrasts sacrifices (not desired) with "thy law within my heart" -> Heb 10:5-7 quotes this and identifies Christ fulfilling it
- Heb 10:1-18 structure: removes one category (sacrifices) while affirming another (law on hearts)

**law-10 (New Covenant and Law):** Examined new covenant law identity. Key findings:
- berith (H1285) = the arrangement/compact, not the law content
- karath berith (H3772 + H1285) = covenant-making idiom
- epigrapho (G1924) = "write upon/inscribe upon" used in Heb 8:10 and 10:16
- I-B Resolution on Heb 8:13 and Decalogue obsolescence: resolved against Abolished reading

## Focus Areas for This Study

### 1. The Cohesive Three-Chapter Argument (NEW)
Prior studies examined individual passages from Hebrews 8-10 (law-08 examined Heb 9:10 and 10:1-9; law-09 examined the covenant passages; law-11 examined the "my law" chain). **This study's unique contribution is reading Hebrews 8-10 as a cohesive unit** -- tracking the author's sustained argument from beginning (8:1) to end (10:18). Map the argument's flow, transitions, and internal logic.

### 2. What Specifically Is the "Shadow"? (Heb 8:5; 10:1)
- skia (G4639) usage across all NT occurrences
- What does the text say casts the shadow vs. what IS the shadow?
- Heb 8:5: the earthly priests "serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things"
- Heb 10:1: "the law having a shadow of good things to come"
- What "law" has the shadow? The text defines it: "those sacrifices which they offered year by year"
- Cross-reference with Col 2:17: "a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ"
- Is skia EVER applied to the moral law/Decalogue?

### 3. What Are the "Carnal Ordinances"? (Heb 9:10)
- dikaiomata sarkos (G1345 + G4561) -- the text defines them: "meats and drinks, and divers washings"
- How "carnal" (sarkos) distinguishes these from moral/spiritual law
- "Imposed until the time of reformation" -- diorthosis (G1357), what is the "reformation"?
- The relationship between dikaioma here and dikaioma in Rom 8:4 ("the righteousness of the law")

### 4. What Is "Taken Away" vs. What Is "Established"? (Heb 10:9)
- Context: Heb 10:5-8 quotes Psa 40:6-8 -- sacrifice/offering/burnt offerings are the "first"
- anaireo (G337) = "take away" the sacrificial system
- histemi (G2476) = "establish" the will of God / Christ's once-for-all offering
- Critical: v.16 then writes "my laws" on hearts AFTER the removal -- what is removed and what remains?

### 5. The Priesthood-Law Connection (Heb 7:11-12 -> 8:1-6)
- Heb 7:12: priesthood change -> "of necessity a change also of the law"
- metathesis (G3331) = "change/transfer" (not "abolition")
- What law specifically changes with the priesthood? The Levitical succession law? All law?
- Heb 8:1-6: Christ as high priest of the heavenly sanctuary
- The relationship between the Melchizedek priesthood and the new covenant

### 6. The "Faultless" Question and Jer 31:31-34 (Heb 8:7-12)
- "If that first had been faultless" -- what is the antecedent of "that first"?
- "Finding fault with THEM" (autous, v.8) -- grammatical analysis
- The full Jeremiah 31:31-34 quotation -- what does each promise element identify?
- "Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers" -- what is "not according to"?
- "My laws" (nomous mou) -- the possessive pronoun argument

### 7. Heb 8:13 -- "Made the First Old...Vanish Away"
- palaioo (G3822) and aphanismos (G854) -- what is their subject?
- The neuter participles (palaioumenon, geraskon) -- gender agreement question
- What specifically is "vanishing"? The law content or the covenant administration?
- Prior I-B resolutions on this verse (law-09, law-10) -- this study should examine whether reading the three chapters as a unit strengthens or challenges those resolutions

### 8. The Sanctuary as "Figure" and "Pattern" (Heb 9:1-10, 23-24)
- parabole (G3850) = "figure for the time then present" (Heb 9:9)
- hupodeigma (G5262) = "example/copy" (Heb 8:5; 9:23)
- antitypos (G499) = "counterpart/figure" (Heb 9:24)
- The earthly sanctuary as a teaching tool pointing to heavenly reality
- What the sanctuary service teaches about the moral law vs. ceremonial law

### 9. Christ's Better Sacrifice (Heb 9:11-28)
- "By his own blood" vs. blood of goats and calves
- "Once for all" (ephapax, G2178) -- the finality of Christ's sacrifice
- "The mediator of the new testament" (diatheke) -- Heb 9:15
- "For the redemption of the transgressions" -- transgressions presuppose a continuing law
- The testament/will analogy (Heb 9:16-17) and its implications

### 10. The "My Laws on Hearts" Climax (Heb 10:15-18)
- Second quotation of Jer 31:33-34 within the argument that removes sacrifices
- The Holy Spirit is identified as the speaker of Jeremiah's prophecy (v.15)
- The structural significance: chapters 8-10 end by affirming law on hearts AFTER removing the ceremonial system
- This is the climax of the entire Hebrews 7-10 argument
