## Ordinance/Decree Vocabulary

### dikaioma (G1345) -- "ordinance, righteous requirement"

**Critical Observation:** The same word dikaioma is translated "ordinances" in Heb 9:1,10 (modified by "of divine service" and "carnal") and "the righteousness" in Rom 8:4 ("that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us"). Context determines meaning: in Hebrews 9 it refers to ceremonial regulations; in Romans 8 it refers to the righteous requirement of the law.

### dogma (G1378) -- "decree, ordinance"
**Original:** dogma
**Transliteration:** dogma

**Original:** hierosyne
**Transliteration:** hierosyne

**BLB Count:** 4 occurrences (ALL in Hebrews)

**All 4 verses:** Heb 7:11, 7:12, 7:14, 7:24

**Critical Context:** Heb 7:12 -- "For the priesthood (hierosyne) being changed, there is made of necessity a change (metathesis) also of the law." The priesthood change necessitates a law change -- but what law? The context (7:11-16) identifies the law of priestly succession (tribal/hereditary requirement).

---

**Original:** diatheke
**Transliteration:** diatheke
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun

**BLB Count:** 33 occurrences

**All Translations:**
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|-----------|

| testament | 11 | 33.3% |
| covenants | 3 | 9.1% |
| the covenant | 2 | 6.1% |

**Hebrews 8-10 Occurrences (17 times!):**

- **Heb 10:16** -- "covenant" -- This is the covenant that I will make
- **Heb 10:29** -- "covenant" -- blood of the covenant

**Observation:** The KJV alternates between "covenant" and "testament" for the same Greek word. In Heb 9:15-20, the translation shifts to "testament" because of the will/inheritance analogy. This is the same word throughout.

---

### kainos (G2537) -- "new (in quality)"
**Original:** kainos
**Transliteration:** kainos
**Part of Speech:** adjective
**Definition:** "new (especially in freshness)"
**BLB Count:** 44 occurrences

**Key Hebrews Occurrences:**
- **Heb 8:8** -- "a new covenant" (kainen diatheken)
- **Heb 8:13** -- "A new [covenant]" (Kainen)
- **Heb 9:15** -- "the new testament" (kaines diathekes)

**Semantic note:** kainos denotes newness in quality/character (as opposed to neos which denotes newness in time). The "new covenant" is qualitatively different in its administration, not necessarily in its law content (since the same "my laws" are written on hearts).

---

### palaioo (G3822) -- "to make old, declare obsolete"
**Original:** palaioo
**Transliteration:** palaioo
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** "to make (passively, become) worn out, or declare obsolete"
**BLB Count:** 4 occurrences

**All Translations:**
| Translation | Count | Verse |
|------------|-------|-------|
| old | 1 | Luke 12:33 |
| he hath made [old] | 1 | **Heb 8:13** |
| that which decayeth | 1 | **Heb 8:13** |
| shall wax old | 1 | Heb 1:11 |

**Key Verse Analysis (Heb 8:13):**
- "he hath made the first old" -- pepalaioken (Perfect Active Indicative) -- completed action with present results
- "that which decayeth" -- palaioumenon (Present Passive Participle, Nominative Singular **Neuter**) -- ongoing process
- "waxeth old" -- geraskon (Present Active Participle, Nominative Singular **Neuter**) -- ongoing process

**Gender note:** The participles palaioumenon and geraskon are NEUTER. diatheke (covenant) is FEMININE. This gender mismatch is significant for identifying what is "vanishing."

---

### aphanismos (G854) -- "vanishing, disappearance"
**Original:** aphanismos
**Transliteration:** aphanismos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** "disappearance, i.e. (figuratively) abrogation"

## Abolish/Take Away/Establish Vocabulary

### anaireo (G337) -- "to take away, remove, kill"
**Original:** anaireo

| to kill/slay/slain (various) | 22 | 91.7% |
| He taketh away | 1 | 4.2% |
| took/up | 1 | 4.2% |

**Critical Verse:** **Heb 10:9** -- "He taketh away the first" (anairei to proton) -- Present Active Indicative. The predominant meaning is "to remove/destroy." In Heb 10:9 context, "the first" = sacrifices/offerings (defined by vv. 5-8).

**Context of "the first" in Heb 10:5-9:**
- v.5: "Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not"
- v.6: "In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure"
- v.8: "Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin"

**Critical Verses:**
- **Heb 10:9** -- stese (Aorist Active Subjunctive) -- "that he may establish the second" (God's will)
- **Rom 3:31** -- histanomen -- "we establish the law" -- same verb used to affirm the law continues through faith

---

### katargeo (G2673) -- "to abolish, make void, render useless"
**Original:** katargeo
**Transliteration:** katargeo
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** "to be (render) entirely idle (useless), literally or figuratively"
**BLB Count:** 27 occurrences

**All Translations (highly varied -- 30 unique!):**
| Translation | Verse |
|------------|-------|
| Having abolished | Eph 2:15 |
| hath abolished | 2 Tim 1:10 |
| shall destroy | 1 Cor 15:24; 2 Thes 2:8 |
| is done away | 2 Cor 3:7, 11 |
| make void | Rom 3:31 |
| come to nought | 1 Cor 2:6 |
| of none effect | Rom 4:14 |
| (many others) | |

**Key Verses for Law Study:**
- **Eph 2:15** -- "Having abolished...the law of commandments contained in ordinances" (dogma-qualified law)
- **2 Cor 3:7,11,13** -- "done away" / "was to be done away" -- the glory of the ministration
- **Rom 3:31** -- "Do we then make void (katargeo) the law? God forbid: yea, we establish (histemi) the law"

**Critical note:** katargeo is NEVER used in Hebrews 8-10. The author of Hebrews uses different vocabulary: palaioo (make old), anaireo (take away), metathesis (change/transfer).

## Additional Key Terms

### metathesis (G3331) -- "change, transfer, removal"
**Original:** metathesis
**Transliteration:** metathesis

**All Translations:**
| Translation | Verse |
|------------|-------|
| a change | **Heb 7:12** |
| translation | Heb 11:5 |
| removing | Heb 12:27 |

**Key Verse:** **Heb 7:12** -- "the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change (metathesis) also of the law." This is NOT katargeo (abolish) -- it is metathesis (transfer/change). The law of priestly qualification is transferred from one basis (Levitical descent) to another (the order of Melchisedec).

---

### diorthosis (G1357) -- "reformation, setting right"
**Original:** diorthosis
**Transliteration:** diorthosis
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun

- **Heb 10:16** -- "I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write (epigrapho) them"
- The word literally means "to write upon" -- the same laws are inscribed on hearts rather than on stone

---

### mesites (G3316) -- "mediator, go-between"
**Original:** mesites
**Transliteration:** mesites
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** "a go-between, i.e. an internunciator, or (by implication) a reconciler"
**BLB Count:** 6 occurrences

**All Verses:**
| Translation | Verse |
|------------|-------|
| the mediator | Gal 3:19; **Heb 8:6**; **Heb 12:24** |
| mediator | 1 Tim 2:5 |
| a mediator | Gal 3:20 |
| of a mediator | **Heb 9:15** |

**Key Hebrews Usage:**
- **Heb 8:6** -- Christ "the mediator of a better covenant"
- **Heb 9:15** -- "the mediator of the new testament"
- **Heb 12:24** -- "Jesus the mediator of the new covenant"

---

### ephapax (G2178) -- "once for all"
**Original:** ephapax
**Transliteration:** ephapax
**Part of Speech:** adverb
**Definition:** "upon one occasion (only)"
**BLB Count:** 5 occurrences

**All Verses:**
| Translation | Verse |
|------------|-------|
| once | Rom 6:10; **Heb 7:27; 9:12; 10:10** |
| at once | 1 Cor 15:6 |

**Hebrews Usage:**
- **Heb 7:27** -- "this he did once (ephapax), when he offered up himself"
- **Heb 9:12** -- "by his own blood he entered in once (ephapax)"
- **Heb 10:10** -- "the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once (ephapax) [for all]"

**Significance:** The "once for all" nature of Christ's sacrifice is repeated 3 times in Hebrews -- contrasted with the repeated Levitical sacrifices. This is the core argument for why the sacrificial system is removed.
