# Hebrews 8-10: Priesthood, Covenant, and Law

**A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence**

---

Hebrews chapters 8 through 10 are among the most frequently cited passages in discussions about whether the Old Testament law continues under the new covenant or was entirely set aside. These three chapters form a single, sustained argument about Christ's priesthood, the change of covenants, and what exactly was "taken away" versus what was "established." The question at stake is precise: What does the text itself identify as the "shadow"? What are the "carnal ordinances"? And do God's moral laws survive the transition, or does everything go?

A careful reading of what the text actually says -- and what it does not say -- yields clear answers.

## The Fault Was with the People, Not the Law

The argument begins in Hebrews 8, where the author announces that Christ is a superior high priest ministering in a heavenly sanctuary rather than an earthly one. A new covenant is coming -- but why? The text answers directly:

> "For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah." (Hebrews 8:8)

The word "them" here is critical. In the original Greek, the pronoun is masculine plural, referring to the people -- not to the law or the covenant. If the author had meant "finding fault with it" (the covenant), he would have used a different grammatical form. The text places the blame squarely on the people's failure to keep the covenant, not on any deficiency in the law itself.

This matters because the solution God announces is not a replacement of the law's content, but a change in where the law resides:

> "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people." (Hebrews 8:10)

The phrase "my laws" uses a possessive pronoun -- these are God's own existing laws. The text does not say "I will give them new laws" or "I will give them different laws." It says God will take "my laws" and write them on hearts instead of on stone. The problem was never what the law said; the problem was where it was written and the people's inability to keep it.

## What the Text Says Is "Vanishing"

Hebrews 8:13 is often quoted to argue that the entire Old Testament law is passing away:

> "In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away." (Hebrews 8:13)

But what exactly is "vanishing"? The verse itself does not specify. The answer comes in the very next verses, where the author begins describing what the first covenant arrangement actually contained. Chapter 9 opens with a detailed inventory:

> "Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary." (Hebrews 9:1)

The author then walks through the tabernacle's furnishings, the priestly rituals, and the sacrificial system -- and arrives at a precise definition:

> "Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation." (Hebrews 9:10)

This is the author's own definition of what the "carnal ordinances" consist of: food regulations, drink regulations, and various ceremonial washings. These are the things that were "imposed until the time of reformation" -- that is, temporary measures awaiting Christ's arrival. The text defines its own terms. The "carnal ordinances" are about dietary rules and ritual purification, not about moral commands like "Thou shalt not kill" or "Remember the sabbath day."

## The "Shadow" Is Defined as the Sacrificial System

Chapter 10 brings the argument to its climax, and once again the text defines its own key term:

> "For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect." (Hebrews 10:1)

The word "shadow" is applied to "the law," but the verse itself tells us which aspect of the law is the shadow: "those sacrifices which they offered year by year." The shadow is the sacrificial system -- the repeated animal offerings that could never truly take away sin. The verse does not say "the law is a shadow" and leave it at that; it specifies exactly what part of the law it is talking about.

The author drives the point home:

> "For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins." (Hebrews 10:4)

And then, quoting Psalm 40, the author shows what God always intended:

> "Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God." (Hebrews 10:5-7)

This leads to one of the most important verses in the passage:

> "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second." (Hebrews 10:9)

What is "the first" that is taken away? The context of verses 5-8 has just defined it: "sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin." What is "the second" that is established? The context identifies it as "the will of God" (verse 7). The text does not say "He taketh away the moral law that he may establish something else." It says the sacrificial system is taken away so that God's will may be established.

## The Bracketing Structure: "My Laws" Survive Everything That Is Removed

One of the most revealing features of Hebrews 8-10 is its structure. The author quotes from Jeremiah 31:33-34 twice -- once at the beginning of his argument (Hebrews 8:8-12) and once at the end (Hebrews 10:16-17):

> "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more." (Hebrews 10:16-17)

Between these two quotations -- between 8:10 and 10:16 -- the author has laid out everything that is being removed: the earthly sanctuary service, the priestly rituals, the animal sacrifices, the dietary regulations, and the ceremonial washings. All of these are identified, described, and declared obsolete. But on both sides of this removal stands the same declaration: "my laws" are written on hearts.

The laws that God calls "my laws" survive everything that is removed between the two Jeremiah quotations. They are not part of what is taken away -- they are the enduring reality that the new covenant preserves and internalizes.

## The Flesh and Conscience Distinction

The author of Hebrews draws a deliberate distinction between two levels of spiritual reality. The old system operated at the level of the flesh:

> "Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances." (Hebrews 9:10)

Animal sacrifices could purify externally but not internally:

> "For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" (Hebrews 9:13-14)

The old system purified the flesh; Christ's blood purifies the conscience. The author is distinguishing between regulations that dealt with external, physical matters (what you eat, how you wash, which animal you sacrifice) and the deeper moral reality that concerns the conscience. The ceremonial system dealt with the outside; Christ deals with the inside -- which is precisely where "my laws" are now written.

## Sin Still Exists -- Which Means a Standard Still Exists

Near the end of chapter 10, the author issues a solemn warning:

> "For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, But a certain fearful looking for of judgment." (Hebrews 10:26-27)

This warning only makes sense if there is still a standard by which "sin" is measured. If all law had been removed, the concept of "willful sin" would have no meaning. The author clearly assumes that believers can violate a moral standard and face judgment for it. This presupposes that a law defining sin remains in effect -- consistent with "my laws" being written on hearts.

The author even uses Moses' law as a point of comparison:

> "He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God?" (Hebrews 10:28-29)

Far from dismissing the gravity of law-breaking, the author argues that rejecting Christ brings even greater accountability than violating the law under Moses.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

Honest engagement with this passage requires acknowledging what the text does not explicitly state:

- **Hebrews 8-10 never names the Ten Commandments or the moral law as part of what is "vanishing."** Every item the author lists as passing away is ceremonial or sacrificial: sanctuary service, priestly rituals, animal sacrifices, dietary rules, and washings. The Decalogue is never mentioned in these lists.

- **The text does not use the terms "moral law" or "ceremonial law."** These categorical labels are not found in the passage. However, the distinction is observable in what the author does: he lists specific ceremonial items as obsolete while affirming "my laws" on hearts.

- **The passage does not explicitly say "these are the same moral laws from Sinai."** The phrase "my laws" with the possessive pronoun is consistent with God's pre-existing laws, and the text never calls them "new" or "different" laws, but the explicit identification "these are the Ten Commandments" is not made in these verses.

- **Hebrews 8:13 does not specify by name what is "ready to vanish."** The immediate context (chapter 9) fills in the answer with ceremonial items, but the verse itself leaves the referent unspecified.

- **The "change of the law" in Hebrews 7:12 does not specify scope in isolation.** However, the surrounding context (Hebrews 7:11-16) identifies the specific law that changes as the requirement for priestly descent from the tribe of Levi -- not the entire body of moral law.

## Conclusion

Hebrews 8-10 presents a carefully constructed argument that Christ's once-for-all sacrifice replaces the Levitical sacrificial system. The text identifies what is passing away with remarkable precision: earthly sanctuary service, priestly rituals, animal sacrifices, dietary regulations, and ceremonial washings. It identifies what endures with equal clarity: "my laws" written on hearts and minds. The fault was with the people who could not keep the covenant, not with the laws themselves. The solution is not new laws but a new location for the same laws -- inscribed on the heart rather than on stone. The sacrificial shadow is removed; the moral substance remains and is internalized. Every item the author names as obsolete is ceremonial. The laws God calls "my own" survive the transition and define the new covenant relationship.
