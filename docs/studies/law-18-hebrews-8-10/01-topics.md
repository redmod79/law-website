## Related Topics Discovered

The Nave's ORDINANCE entry directly cross-references Heb 9:1,8-10 under "INSUFFICIENCY OF, FOR SALVATION." This is significant: Nave's own classification places the Hebrews 9 ordinances in the category of ordinances insufficient for salvation, alongside Eph 2:15 and Col 2:14,20-23 -- all ceremonial/ritual law passages.

The COVENANT entry lists "Of the Ten Commandments EXO 34:28; DEU 5:2,3; 9:9" as a distinct covenant instance, and separately lists "THE SECOND COVENANT JER 31:31-34; HEB 8:4-13; 12:18-24; 13:20."
