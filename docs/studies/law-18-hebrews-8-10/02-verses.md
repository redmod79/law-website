## Primary Passage: Hebrews 8-10 (Complete Text)

### Hebrews 8

> **8:1** Now of the things which we have spoken [this is] the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
> **8:2** A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
> **8:3** For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore [it is] of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
> **8:4** For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
> **8:5** Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, [that] thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
> **8:6** But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
> **8:7** For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
> **8:8** For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
> **8:9** Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
> **8:10** For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
> **8:11** And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
> **8:12** For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
> **8:13** In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old [is] ready to vanish away.

### Hebrews 9

> **9:1** Then verily the first [covenant] had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
> **9:2** For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein [was] the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.
> **9:3** And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;
> **9:4** Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein [was] the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
> **9:5** And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
> **9:6** Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service [of God].
> **9:7** But into the second [went] the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and [for] the errors of the people:
> **9:8** The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:
> **9:9** Which [was] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
> **9:10** [Which stood] only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed [on them] until the time of reformation.
> **9:11** But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
> **9:12** Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption [for us].
> **9:13** For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:
> **9:14** How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
> **9:15** And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions [that were] under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
> **9:16** For where a testament [is], there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.
> **9:17** For a testament [is] of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.
> **9:18** Whereupon neither the first [testament] was dedicated without blood.
> **9:19** For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,
> **9:20** Saying, This [is] the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.
> **9:21** Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.
> **9:22** And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
> **9:23** [It was] therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
> **9:24** For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, [which are] the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:
> **9:25** Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;
> **9:26** For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
> **9:27** And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
> **9:28** So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.

### Hebrews 10

> **10:1** For the law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
> **10:2** For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.
> **10:3** But in those [sacrifices there is] a remembrance again [made] of sins every year.
> **10:4** For [it is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
> **10:5** Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:
> **10:6** In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
> **10:7** Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
> **10:8** Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and [offering] for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure [therein]; which are offered by the law;
> **10:9** Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
> **10:10** By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once [for all].
> **10:11** And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
> **10:12** But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
> **10:13** From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
> **10:14** For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
> **10:15** [Whereof] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
> **10:16** This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
> **10:17** And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
> **10:18** Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for sin.
> **10:19** Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
> **10:20** By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
> **10:21** And [having] an high priest over the house of God;
> **10:22** Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
> **10:23** Let us hold fast the profession of [our] faith without wavering; (for he [is] faithful that promised;)
> **10:24** And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:
> **10:25** Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some [is]; but exhorting [one another]: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
> **10:26** For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
> **10:27** But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
> **10:28** He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
> **10:29** Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
> **10:30** For we know him that hath said, Vengeance [belongeth] unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
> **10:31** [It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
> **10:32** But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;
> **10:33** Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.
> **10:34** For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.
> **10:35** Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.
> **10:36** For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.
> **10:37** For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.
> **10:38** Now the just shall live by faith: but if [any man] draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
> **10:39** But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.

## OT Passages Quoted/Referenced in Hebrews 8-10

### Jeremiah 31:30-34 (Quoted in Heb 8:8-12 and 10:16-17)

> **31:30** But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
> **31:31** Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
> **31:32** Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day [that] I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:
> **31:33** But this [shall be] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
> **31:34** And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.

### Psalm 40:1-8 (Quoted in Heb 10:5-7)

> **40:1** To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
> **40:2** He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, [and] established my goings.
> **40:3** And he hath put a new song in my mouth, [even] praise unto our God: many shall see [it], and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.
> **40:4** Blessed [is] that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
> **40:5** Many, O LORD my God, [are] thy wonderful works [which] thou hast done, and thy thoughts [which are] to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: [if] I would declare and speak [of them], they are more than can be numbered.
> **40:6** Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
> **40:7** Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book [it is] written of me,
> **40:8** I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law [is] within my heart.

**Note:** Psalm 40:8 "thy law [is] within my heart" directly connects to Heb 10:16 "I will put my laws into their hearts." The Hebrews author quotes the Psalm to identify what Christ came to do (God's will) versus what was removed (sacrifices), and then immediately quotes Jeremiah 31 about law on hearts.
