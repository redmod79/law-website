# Hebrews 8-10 -- Priesthood, Covenant, and Law

## Question
What do Hebrews 8-10 teach about priesthood, covenant, and law? What specifically is the "shadow"? What are the "carnal ordinances"? What is "taken away" vs. what is "established"? How do these three chapters build one cohesive argument?

## Summary Answer
Hebrews 8-10 presents a sustained argument that Christ's once-for-all sacrifice replaces the Levitical sacrificial system. The text identifies the "shadow" as the sacrificial/ceremonial system (8:5; 9:9; 10:1 -- defined by "those sacrifices"), the "carnal ordinances" as regulations about "meats and drinks, and divers washings" (9:10), and "the first" that is taken away as "sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings" (10:5-9). The argument is bracketed by two quotations of Jeremiah 31:33-34 (8:8-12 and 10:16-17), both affirming that God writes "my laws" on hearts -- using the possessive pronoun to identify these as God's pre-existing laws that survive the ceremonial system's removal.

## Key Verses

- **Heb 8:8** -- "For finding fault with them [autous, masculine plural = the people], he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant"
- **Heb 8:10** -- "I will put my laws [nomous mou] into their mind, and write them in their hearts"
- **Heb 8:13** -- "In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away."
- **Heb 9:1** -- "Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary."
- **Heb 9:10** -- "[Which stood] only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation."
- **Heb 10:1** -- "For the law having a shadow of good things to come...can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect."
- **Heb 10:9** -- "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second."
- **Heb 10:16** -- "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them."

## Analysis

### The Cohesive Three-Chapter Argument

Hebrews 8-10 is not a collection of isolated proof-texts; it is a single sustained argument with a clear logical progression:

**Chapter 8** establishes the framework: Christ is a superior high priest ministering in the heavenly sanctuary (8:1-6). The first covenant was not faultless -- but the fault was "with them" (autous, 8:8), i.e., the people, not the law. The solution is Jeremiah's new covenant: God's laws written on hearts (8:10). What is "vanishing" (8:13) is then defined by the immediate context.

**Chapter 9** identifies what belongs to the old covenant arrangement: "ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary" (9:1). The author inventories the tabernacle, describes the priestly service (9:2-7), identifies the system as a "figure" (parabole, 9:9) that could not perfect the conscience, and defines its content as "carnal ordinances" about "meats, drinks, and washings" imposed "until the time of reformation" (9:10). Christ then replaces this system with his own blood (9:11-28).

**Chapter 10** completes the argument: the "shadow" law with its repeated sacrifices cannot perfect worshipers (10:1-4). Psalm 40 provides the framework: sacrifices are taken away, God's will is established (10:5-10). Christ's one sacrifice perfects forever (10:11-14). The Holy Spirit witnesses through Jeremiah 31 again: "my laws" on hearts, sins forgiven, no more offering needed (10:15-18).

The structural key is that the Jeremiah 31 quotation BRACKETS the argument. The first quotation (8:8-12) opens the discussion of what is passing away; the second quotation (10:16-17) closes it. Between these bookends, the author identifies everything that is being removed: sanctuary service (9:1-5), priestly rituals (9:6-7), carnal ordinances (9:10), and animal sacrifices (10:1-4, 5-9). The "my laws" written on hearts SURVIVE the removal of everything between the bookends.

### What the Text Identifies as Passing Away

The author provides a chain of self-definitions:
1. "Ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary" (9:1)
2. Priestly service in the tabernacle (9:6-7)
3. "Gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience" (9:9)
4. "Meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances" (9:10)
5. "Those sacrifices which they offered year by year" (10:1)
6. "Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin" (10:5-8)
7. "The first" = sacrifices (10:9, defined by vv. 5-8)

### What the Text Identifies as Continuing

1. "My laws" written on hearts (8:10; 10:16) -- using the possessive "my" (mou)
2. "The second" = the will of God (10:9, defined by v. 7)
3. Christ's priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary (8:1-2; 9:11-12, 24)
4. The standard against which "sin" is measured (10:26 -- "if we sin wilfully")

### Greek Grammar Observations

1. **Heb 8:8 -- autous (Acc. Pl. Masc.):** "Finding fault with THEM" -- the people, not the covenant or law. If the author intended "finding fault with it [the covenant]," he would have used auten (Acc. Sg. Fem.).
2. **Heb 8:13 -- neuter participles:** to palaioumenon and geraskon are Nominative Singular NEUTER, not agreeing with diatheke (feminine). The neuter article + participle forms a generalizing construction ("the thing that is decaying") rather than a direct reference to the feminine covenant.
3. **Heb 10:9 -- to proton / to deuteron (neuter):** "The first" and "the second" are Accusative Singular NEUTER, matching the neuter nouns in context (thelema = will; the sacrificial system described), not the feminine diatheke.
4. **Heb 10:16 -- nomous mou:** "My laws" with possessive pronoun, identical to 8:10. The laws belong to God and are written on hearts.

### Necessary Implications

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The author of Hebrews identifies the content of the first covenant that is passing away as ceremonial/ritual in nature: sanctuary service, priestly rituals, animal sacrifices, dietary rules, and washings -- not the moral law. | E7, E9, E10, E14, E16, E17 | Every item the author lists as belonging to the "first" that is removed (ordinances of service, worldly sanctuary, gifts and sacrifices, meats/drinks/washings, carnal ordinances, sacrificial offerings) is ceremonial/ritual. The moral law or Decalogue is never listed among these items. Any reader can verify this by reading the list. | Continues |
| N2 | The Jeremiah 31:33-34 quotation (Heb 8:8-12; 10:16-17) structurally brackets the entire argument about what is removed. The "my laws" on hearts survive everything that is removed between these two quotations. | E5, E19, E7, E10, E14, E17 | The first quotation is at 8:8-12; the second is at 10:16-17. Between them lies the description of what is removed (9:1-10:14). The "my laws" appear on both sides of the removal. Both sides can verify this structural observation. | Continues |
| N3 | The Hebrews author distinguishes between what deals with the "flesh" (ceremonial ordinances) and what deals with the "conscience" (Christ's sacrifice/moral law). | E10, E12 | E10 says the carnal ordinances deal with "meats, drinks, washings" (flesh-level). E12 says animal blood purifies "the flesh" while Christ's blood purges "the conscience." The author uses this flesh/conscience vocabulary to distinguish two categories. Any reader can observe this distinction. | Continues |
| N4 | The concept of "sin" and "transgression" in Hebrews 9:15 and 10:26 presupposes a continuing moral standard. | E13, E21 | E13 references "the redemption of the transgressions" under the first covenant. E21 warns of "willful sin" with judgment. Transgression and sin are defined as violations of law (1 John 3:4). If all law were removed, these terms would have no referent. Both sides can verify this logical entailment. | Neutral |

#### Tree 4 Application (N-Item Positional Classification)

**N1 -- Continues:**
- Gate 0: N-Test 1 (Universal agreement): Would an Abolished scholar agree that the items listed in Heb 9:1-10 and 10:1-9 are ceremonial? Both sides agree these items (sacrifices, tabernacle, meats/drinks/washings) are ceremonial. The implication, however, is that the author distinguishes moral from ceremonial by listing only ceremonial items as passing away. An Abolished scholar might not agree this constitutes a distinction. However, the factual observation is that the author lists ONLY ceremonial items as what is removed. This is observable.
- N-Test 2: Is this the only possible conclusion? The items listed are verifiably ceremonial. The Decalogue is verifiably absent from the list. -> Yes.
- N-Test 3: No added concepts -- simply observing what IS and IS NOT in the author's list. -> Yes.
- All three pass. -> N-tier confirmed. Then apply Tree 3:
- V1 scan: The observation that the author lists only ceremonial items as passing away (not the moral law) supports the existence of a biblical distinction between categories of law -> Continues.
- Gates 1-4: All pass (the observation is factual, grammatically grounded, didactic genre, consistent with N017/N018). -> Continues.

**N2 -- Continues:**
- Gate 0: N-Test 1: Would an Abolished scholar agree that 8:8-12 and 10:16-17 are the two Jeremiah 31 quotations and that they appear on either side of the ceremonial removal argument? Yes -- this is a structural observation. Would they agree "my laws" survive? The text says "my laws into their hearts" after describing removal. This is what the text says. -> Yes.
- N-Test 2: Is there another reading? One could argue "my laws" are different from the OT law, but the text itself uses the possessive "my" without qualifying these as "new" laws. The structural observation is the only reading of the text's layout. -> Yes.
- N-Test 3: No added concepts. -> Yes.
- All pass. Apply Tree 3: V1 = law-continuation vocabulary (my laws on hearts) surviving ceremonial removal -> Continues.
- Gates 1-4: All pass. -> Continues.

**N3 -- Continues:**
- Gate 0: N-Test 1: Would an Abolished scholar agree the author uses "flesh" for ceremonial regulations and "conscience" for Christ's work? The vocabulary is observable. -> Yes.
- N-Test 2: The distinction between sarkos/suneidesis is textually present. -> Yes.
- N-Test 3: No added concepts. -> Yes.
- Apply Tree 3: V1 = The author distinguishes between categories (flesh-level = ceremonial; conscience-level = moral/spiritual). This supports the Continues position's claim that the Bible itself distinguishes law categories. -> Continues.

**N4 -- Neutral:**
- Gate 0: N-Test 1: Would both sides agree sin and transgression presuppose a standard? Yes. N-Test 2: Only possible conclusion. N-Test 3: No added concepts.
- Apply Tree 3: V1: No specific continuation vocabulary for the moral law. V2: No cessation vocabulary. -> Neutral. Both sides agree sin presupposes a standard; they disagree on which standard.

### Inferences

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria | Classification |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|---|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that the new covenant contains the same moral law as the old covenant, with a different administration (law on hearts instead of on stone). | I-A | E5/Heb 8:10: "my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts." E19/Heb 10:16: same quotation. E4/Heb 8:8: fault with the people, not the law. E038/Jer 31:33: "my law in their inward parts." N2: the bracketing structure preserves "my laws" while removing ceremonial system. | The text says "my laws" on hearts but does not explicitly state "these are the same moral laws from Sinai." The possessive "my" and the lack of "new laws" language are consistent with this reading, but systematizing these into the claim "same law, different administration" requires combining multiple E/N items. | #5 (systematizing) | Continues |
| I2 | Heb 8:13 "that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away" includes the Decalogue/moral law. | I-B | E6/Heb 8:13: "he hath made the first old...ready to vanish away." E005/Deu 4:13: "his covenant...ten commandments." E275: neuter participles do not agree with diatheke. FOR: E005 identifies covenant terms as the Decalogue; E6 makes the first covenant old. AGAINST: E4 (fault with people, not law), E5/E19 ("my laws" written on hearts after removal), E7/E10 (first covenant's content defined as ceremonial ordinances), N1 (only ceremonial items listed as passing). | Requires adding the assumption that "the first" being made old = the Decalogue being abolished. The immediate context (9:1-10) defines the first covenant's operational content as ceremonial. Reading 8:13 as including the Decalogue requires overriding the contextual definition provided by the author in 9:1-10. | #1 (adding a concept), #2 (choosing between readings) | Abolished |
| I3 | "The law" in Heb 10:1 ("the law having a shadow") means the entire Torah including the moral law, not just the ceremonial component. | I-B | E14/Heb 10:1: "the law having a shadow...can never with those sacrifices." FOR: ho nomos is the grammatical subject; nomos can mean the entire Torah. AGAINST: The verse self-defines the shadow component: "with those sacrifices which they offered year by year." N1: only ceremonial items listed as what fails. E5/E19: "my laws" on hearts after removal. | The text uses nomos but immediately defines the shadow aspect as "those sacrifices." Reading nomos as the entire Torah including moral law requires ignoring the self-defining clause. Reading it as the sacrificial aspect of the Torah requires choosing between possible senses of nomos. | #2 (choosing between readings) | Abolished |
| I4 | The Hebrews 8-10 argument constitutes evidence that the Bible distinguishes between moral and ceremonial law categories. | I-A | E7/Heb 9:1: first covenant had "ordinances of divine service." E10/Heb 9:10: "carnal ordinances" = meats, drinks, washings. E14/Heb 10:1: "those sacrifices." E17/Heb 10:9: "the first" = sacrifices taken away. E5/E19/Heb 8:10, 10:16: "my laws" on hearts. N1: only ceremonial items listed as removed. N2: "my laws" bracket the removal. N3: flesh/conscience distinction. | The text does not use the terms "moral law" and "ceremonial law." However, the author lists specific items as passing away (all ceremonial) while affirming "my laws" on hearts. Systematizing this pattern into the claim "the Bible distinguishes between law categories" requires combining multiple observations. | #5 (systematizing) | Continues |
| I5 | The "carnal ordinances" of Heb 9:10 include the Sabbath or moral law. | I-D | E10/Heb 9:10: "meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances." The text lists three categories: foods, beverages, washings. The Sabbath or Decalogue is not mentioned. No E/N item in this passage lists the Sabbath among the carnal ordinances. | Requires adding the Sabbath/moral law to a list that the text does not include. The text explicitly defines what the carnal ordinances consist of ("only in meats and drinks, and divers washings"). Adding other items overrides what the text specifies. | #1 (adding a concept not stated) | Abolished |
| I6 | The "change of the law" (Heb 7:12) necessitated by the priesthood change means all law (including moral) was changed or abolished. | I-B | E151/Heb 7:12: "the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change [metathesis] also of the law." FOR: metathesis nomou = change of the law; nomos could mean all law. AGAINST: Heb 7:11-16 context identifies the law in question as the law of priestly qualification (tribal requirement); metathesis means "transfer/change" not "abolition" (G3331); Heb 7:16 specifies "the law of a carnal commandment" = the law of priestly hereditary descent. E5/E19: "my laws" still on hearts. | The word metathesis means "change/transfer," not "abolition." The context identifies which law changes: the priestly succession requirement (from Levi to Judah, from hereditary to oath-based). Extending this to all law requires adding a concept the text does not contain. | #1 (adding a concept), #2 (choosing between readings) | Abolished |

### I-B Resolutions

#### I-B Resolution: I2 -- Heb 8:13 "vanishing" includes the Decalogue

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (Abolished): E005 (Deu 4:13: covenant terms = Ten Commandments), E6 (Heb 8:13: first made old, vanishing)
- AGAINST (Continues): E4 (Heb 8:8: fault with people), E5 (Heb 8:10: "my laws" on hearts), E19 (Heb 10:16: "my laws" on hearts), E7 (Heb 9:1: ordinances of divine service), E10 (Heb 9:10: carnal ordinances = meats/drinks/washings), N1 (only ceremonial items listed as removed), N2 (Jeremiah 31 brackets the removal)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E005 | Contextually Clear | Deu 4:13 identifies covenant terms as Ten Commandments, but in Deu 4 context, not in Hebrews context. Requires cross-referencing. |
| E6 | Ambiguous | Heb 8:13 uses neuter participles not matching the feminine diatheke. What is "vanishing" is not specified in this verse alone. |
| E4 | Plain | Heb 8:8 directly states fault was with the people (autous, masculine plural). No interpretation needed. |
| E5 | Plain | Heb 8:10 directly states "my laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts." Possessive pronoun is unambiguous. |
| E19 | Plain | Heb 10:16 repeats E5 verbatim. |
| E7 | Plain | Heb 9:1 directly states what the first covenant had: ordinances of service and sanctuary. |
| E10 | Plain | Heb 9:10 directly defines content: meats, drinks, washings, carnal ordinances. |
| N1 | Contextually Clear | Requires reading 9:1-10:9 to verify the list, but the list is verifiable. |
| N2 | Contextually Clear | Requires observing the structural placement of Jer 31 quotations, but placement is verifiable. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR the claim: 1 Contextually Clear (E005) + 1 Ambiguous (E6) = 2 items, weak clarity
AGAINST the claim: 3 Plain (E4, E5, E19) + 2 Plain (E7, E10) + 2 Contextually Clear (N1, N2) = 7 items, strong clarity

The AGAINST side has substantially more items at higher clarity levels (5 Plain + 2 Contextually Clear) than the FOR side (1 Contextually Clear + 1 Ambiguous).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements in the SAME CHAPTER and immediate context interpret the Ambiguous "vanishing" of E6. Specifically:
- Heb 8:8 (E4, Plain) = fault with the people
- Heb 8:10 (E5, Plain) = "my laws" on hearts (SAME chapter)
- Heb 9:1 (E7, Plain) = first covenant's content = ordinances of service (NEXT verse after 8:13)
- Heb 9:10 (E10, Plain) = carnal ordinances = meats/drinks/washings (same argument)
- Heb 10:16 (E19, Plain) = "my laws" on hearts (closing bracket)

The plain statements in the closest proximity to the ambiguous verse determine its reading: the "vanishing" applies to the covenant's ceremonial administration, not to the law content (which survives and is written on hearts).

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong (against Abolished reading)**
Multiple Plain statements in the same chapter and immediate context unambiguously identify what is passing away (ceremonial system) and what is preserved ("my laws" on hearts). The Ambiguous "vanishing" of E6 is governed by these surrounding Plain statements. This resolution is consistent with the prior I-B resolution in law-09.

#### I-B Resolution: I3 -- "The law" in Heb 10:1 means the entire Torah

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (Abolished): E14 (Heb 10:1: "the law having a shadow" -- ho nomos is the subject)
- AGAINST (Continues): E14 itself (self-defining: "with those sacrifices which they offered year by year"), E5/E19 ("my laws" on hearts), N1 (only ceremonial items listed as removed)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E14 (FOR reading) | Ambiguous | nomos has a wide semantic range (entire Torah, Pentateuch, ceremonial system, principle). The verse uses it broadly. |
| E14 (self-definition) | Plain | The verse itself defines what aspect of "the law" is the shadow: "those sacrifices which they offered year by year." This is self-interpreting. |
| E5/E19 | Plain | "My laws" on hearts in same argument. |
| N1 | Contextually Clear | Only ceremonial items listed as failing/removed. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: 1 Ambiguous reading of nomos.
AGAINST: 1 Plain self-definition in the SAME VERSE + 2 Plain (E5, E19) + 1 Contextually Clear (N1).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The verse self-interprets: "the law having a shadow...can never with THOSE SACRIFICES" -- the self-defining clause identifies the shadow aspect as the sacrificial component. The clear clause in the same verse governs the ambiguous use of nomos.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong (against Abolished reading)**
The verse itself defines its own referent. The self-interpreting clause ("those sacrifices") is maximally clear (same-verse, self-definition = highest clarity).

---

#### I-B Resolution: I6 -- Heb 7:12 "change of the law" = all law abolished

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (Abolished): E151 (Heb 7:12: metathesis nomou = change of the law)
- AGAINST (Continues): Heb 7:11, 13-16 context identifies the law as the priestly qualification law; E152 (Heb 7:16: "the law of a carnal commandment" = priestly hereditary law); E253 (Heb 7:16, 18: entole = the commandment governing priestly succession); E5/E19 ("my laws" on hearts)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E151 | Ambiguous | nomos could mean any scope of law; the verse alone does not specify which law changes. |
| E152 | Plain | Same-author, same chapter: "the law of a carnal commandment" identifies the law in view as the priestly hereditary requirement. |
| E253 | Plain | Heb 7:16, 18 uses entole for the specific commandment governing priestly succession. |
| E5/E19 | Plain | "My laws" on hearts in same letter. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: 1 Ambiguous (E151).
AGAINST: 2 Plain (E152, E253) + 2 Plain (E5, E19) = 4 items at Plain clarity.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The same-chapter, same-author plain statements (Heb 7:16, 18) identify the specific law that changes: the commandment governing priestly descent. metathesis (G3331) = "change/transfer" (used for Enoch's "translation" in Heb 11:5), not katargeo (abolish). The priestly qualification law transfers from Levitical descent to Melchizedek's order.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong (against Abolished reading)**
The immediate context in the same chapter identifies the specific law that changes. The ambiguous nomos is governed by the same-chapter plain statements specifying the priestly succession law.

### Verification Phase

**Step A -- Verify explicit statements:**
- Each E-item quotes or closely paraphrases the actual text of Hebrews 8-10.
- E1-E22 are all textual observations, not positional inferences.
- No E-item contains an inference masquerading as an explicit statement.

**Step A2 -- Verify positional classifications:**
- E4, E5, E19 classified Continues: All pass Tree 3 four gates (documented above).
- E6 classified Neutral: Gate 1 fails (ambiguous referent) -> reclassified via RC3 to Neutral.
- All other E-items classified Neutral: verified by V1/V2 scan (neither continuation nor cessation vocabulary applies to moral law specifically, or the item concerns ceremonial cessation which is shared ground).

**Step B -- Verify necessary implications:**
- N1: Follows from E7, E9, E10, E14, E16, E17 -- verifiable by reading the list of items the author identifies as removed. All three N-tests pass.
- N2: Follows from E5, E19 (two Jer 31 quotations) and E7, E10, E14, E17 (items between them). Structural observation. All three N-tests pass.
- N3: Follows from E10 (flesh) and E12 (conscience). Vocabulary distinction is observable. All three N-tests pass.
- N4: Follows from E13 and E21. Both sides agree sin presupposes a standard. All three N-tests pass.

**Step C -- Verify inference classifications (source test):**
- I1: All components in E/N tables (E4, E5, E19, E038, N2) -> text-derived. -> I-A or I-B.
- I2: Components from E/N tables on both sides -> text-derived. -> I-B (confirmed).
- I3: Components from E/N tables on both sides -> text-derived. -> I-B (confirmed).
- I4: All components in E/N tables (E7, E10, E14, E17, E5, E19, N1, N2, N3) -> text-derived. -> I-A or I-B.
- I5: Requires adding Sabbath/moral law to a list the text does not contain -> external concept added. -> I-C or I-D.
- I6: Components from E/N tables on both sides -> text-derived. -> I-B (confirmed).

**Step D -- Verify inference classifications (direction test):**
- I1: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. -> aligns. -> I-A (confirmed).
- I2: Requires E6 ("vanishing") to include the Decalogue, which E5/E19/E7/E10 contextualize as ceremonial. -> conflicts. -> I-B (confirmed).
- I3: Requires "nomos" in E14 to mean entire Torah, which the self-defining clause limits to sacrifices. -> conflicts. -> I-B (confirmed).
- I4: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. -> aligns. -> I-A (confirmed).
- I5: Requires overriding E10's explicit list ("meats, drinks, washings") to include Sabbath. -> overrides E/N. -> I-D (confirmed).
- I6: Requires E151 "metathesis nomou" to mean all law, which E152/E253 limit to priestly law. -> conflicts. -> I-B (confirmed).

**Step E -- Consistency checks:**
- I1 (I-A): Only requires #5 (systematizing). -> Consistent.
- I2 (I-B): E/N items on both sides (E005/E6 vs. E4/E5/E19/E7/E10/N1/N2). -> Consistent.
- I3 (I-B): E/N items on both sides (E14-nomos vs. E14-self-definition/E5/E19/N1). -> Consistent.
- I4 (I-A): Only requires #5 (systematizing). -> Consistent.
- I5 (I-D): Overrides E10 (explicit list does not include Sabbath). -> Consistent.
- I6 (I-B): E/N items on both sides (E151 vs. E152/E253/E5/E19). -> Consistent.

**Step F -- Verify SIS connections:**
- I2 resolution uses same-chapter/immediate-context connection (Heb 8:8, 10 -> 8:13; Heb 9:1, 10 -> 8:13). Connection verified by proximity and shared argument.
- I3 resolution uses same-verse self-defining clause. Connection verified by grammar.
- I6 resolution uses same-chapter context (Heb 7:11-16 -> 7:12). Connection verified by proximity and shared subject.

## Tally Summary

```
- Explicit statements: 22
  - Continues: 3 (E4, E5, E19)
  - Abolished: 0
  - Neutral: 19
- Necessary implications: 4
  - Continues: 3 (N1, N2, N3)
  - Abolished: 0
  - Neutral: 1 (N4)
- Inferences: 6
  - I-A (Evidence-Extending): 2 (I1 Continues, I4 Continues)
  - I-B (Competing-Evidence): 3 (I2 Abolished resolved Strong against, I3 Abolished resolved Strong against, I6 Abolished resolved Strong against)
  - I-C (Compatible External): 0
  - I-D (Counter-Evidence External): 1 (I5 Abolished)
```

The data from Hebrews 8-10 yields 3 Continues-classified explicit statements and 0 Abolished-classified explicit statements. The 3 Continues-classified necessary implications identify patterns of ceremonial-only removal and law-on-hearts preservation. All 3 I-B inferences (Abolished) resolve Strong against the Abolished reading via SIS, as the plain statements in the same context govern the ambiguous ones. The sole I-D inference (I5) requires overriding the text's explicit list of what constitutes "carnal ordinances."

## What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

**What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):**
- The fault in the first covenant arrangement was with the people, not the law (Heb 8:8 -- autous, masculine plural)
- God's laws ("my laws," nomous mou) are written on hearts under the new covenant (Heb 8:10; 10:16)
- The first covenant's operational content that is passing away consists of "ordinances of divine service," a "worldly sanctuary," "meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances" (Heb 9:1, 10)
- The "shadow" that cannot perfect is identified by the text as "those sacrifices which they offered year by year" (Heb 10:1)
- "The first" that is taken away is "sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings" (Heb 10:5-9)
- "The second" that is established is the will of God (Heb 10:9-10)
- The Jeremiah 31 "my laws on hearts" quotation brackets the entire ceremonial-removal argument, appearing in both 8:10 and 10:16
- The author distinguishes between flesh-level regulations (ceremonial) and conscience-level reality (Christ's work)

**What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):**
- It cannot be said that Hebrews 8-10 identifies the Decalogue as part of what is "vanishing" -- the text lists only ceremonial items
- It cannot be said that "the law" in Heb 10:1 means the entire Torah is a shadow -- the verse self-defines the shadow as "those sacrifices"
- It cannot be said that "carnal ordinances" include the Sabbath or moral law -- the text defines them as "meats, drinks, and washings"
- It cannot be said that "my laws" in 8:10/10:16 are "new" or "different" laws -- the text uses the possessive "my" without qualifying them as new
- It cannot be said that the "change of the law" in Heb 7:12 abolishes all law -- the context identifies the specific law of priestly qualification
- It cannot be said that the moral law is explicitly abolished in Hebrews 8-10 -- no verse in these chapters names the Decalogue or moral commandments as what is removed
- It cannot be said that the author uses the term "moral law" or "ceremonial law" -- these categorical labels are not in the text, though the distinction is observable in the author's itemized lists
