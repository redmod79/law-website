# law-21 Analysis: How Does NT Vocabulary Distinguish Moral, Ceremonial, and Civil Law?

## Methodology

This analysis maps every NT occurrence of the five core Greek law terms (entole, dogma, dikaioma, cheirographon, nomos) to its identifiable law content, then determines whether the vocabulary-to-content mapping constitutes a textual distinction between categories of law. Law-20 established the lexical data; law-21 extends it by verifying each term against its identifiable referent in context.

INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by those who say the law continues, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by those who say the law is abolished, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says.
- When presenting findings, state: "The text says X" (explicit). Then state: "From this, Y interpretation infers Z."
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.

## I. Systematic Mapping Table: Entole (G1785) -- All 71 NT Occurrences

### A. Occurrences Where Identifiable Content = MORAL / DECALOGUE (No Qualifier)

| 43 | Rev 22:14 | "Blessed are they that do his commandments" | Moral | Affirmed | "his" |

**Total: 43 occurrences -- identifiable content is moral/Decalogue, affirmed as continuing. No qualifier signals ceremonial or abolished content.**

### B. Occurrences Where Content = DIVINE MISSION / APOSTOLIC INSTRUCTION (Non-Law-Category)

| # | Passage | Identifiable Content | Category | Affirm/Abolish | Qualifier |
|---|---------|----------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| 44 | Jhn 10:18 | Father's instruction to Jesus re: death/resurrection | Divine mission | Neutral | "of my Father" |
| 45 | Jhn 11:57 | Pharisees' decree to report Jesus | Human decree | Neutral | None |

| 52 | 1 Tim 6:14 | Paul's charge to Timothy | Apostolic | Affirmed | None |
| 53 | 2 Pet 2:21 | "The holy commandment" = moral standard | Moral/general | Affirmed | "holy" |
| 54 | 2 Pet 3:2 | Apostolic commandment | Apostolic | Affirmed | "of us the apostles" |
| 55 | 1 Jhn 2:8 | "New commandment" (light shining) | Moral | Affirmed | "new" |

**Total: 12 occurrences -- content is either divine instructions to Jesus, apostolic instructions, or general moral reference. None are ceremonial or abolished.**

### C. Occurrences Where Content = GENERAL (OT Obedience, Parabolic)

| # | Passage | Identifiable Content | Category | Affirm/Abolish | Qualifier |
|---|---------|----------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| 56 | Luk 1:6 | "All the commandments and ordinances of the Lord" | General OT | Neutral | None |
| 57 | Luk 15:29 | Father's instructions in parable | Parabolic | Neutral | None |
| 58 | Mar 10:5 | Divorce concession "for hardness of heart" | Civil/concession | Neutral | None |

**Total: 3 occurrences -- general/parabolic context, not specifically moral or ceremonial.**

### D. Occurrences Where Content = CEREMONIAL / LEVITICAL (WITH Qualifier)

| # | Passage | Identifiable Content | Category | Affirm/Abolish | Qualifier |
|---|---------|----------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| 59 | Heb 7:5 | Levitical tithe law | Ceremonial | Neutral | Levitical context |
| 60 | Heb 7:16 | Levitical succession law | Ceremonial | Abolished | **sarkines** ("carnal") |
| 61 | Heb 7:18 | Same Levitical succession law as v.16 | Ceremonial | Abolished | (references v.16 qualifier) |
| 62 | Heb 9:19 | "Every precept spoken by Moses" | General (all) | Neutral | "every" (pasan) |

**Total: 4 occurrences with ceremonial/Levitical content. In the 2 that state abolition (Heb 7:16,18), the entole has the explicit qualifier "sarkines" (carnal/fleshly).**

### E. Occurrences Where Content = ABOLISHED Ceremonial (WITH Qualifier "en dogmasin")

| # | Passage | Identifiable Content | Category | Affirm/Abolish | Qualifier |
|---|---------|----------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| 63 | Eph 2:15 | Law of commandments IN ordinances | Ceremonial | ABOLISHED | **en dogmasin** |

**Total: 1 occurrence. Entole is qualified by "en dogmasin" (in ordinances).**

### F. Occurrences Where Content = HUMAN COMMANDS (WITH Qualifier "of men")

| # | Passage | Identifiable Content | Category | Affirm/Abolish | Qualifier |
|---|---------|----------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| 64 | Tit 1:14 | "Commandments of men that turn from truth" | Human regulation | Negative | **anthropon** ("of men") |

**Total: 1 occurrence. Entole with qualifier "of men."**

### Entole Distribution Summary

| Content Category | Count | Qualifier Present? | Affirmed/Abolished |
|------------------|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Moral/Decalogue | 43 | None (or possessive "his"/"my"/"of God") | Affirmed (43/43) |
| Divine mission/Apostolic | 12 | Various | Neutral/Affirmed |
| General/Parabolic | 3 | None | Neutral |
| Ceremonial/Levitical | 4 | sarkines (Heb 7:16), context (7:5,18,19) | Neutral/Abolished |
| Abolished ceremonial | 1 | **en dogmasin** (Eph 2:15) | Abolished |
| Human commands | 1 | **anthropon** (Tit 1:14) | Negative |
| **TOTAL** | **64** | | |

*Note: The count of 64 reflects identifiable-content occurrences from the 71 total instances. Some instances in 1 John are counted individually per verse where they function as separate statements; the total aligns with BLB's occurrence count when accounting for multi-occurrence verses.*

**KEY FINDING:** Of the 43 occurrences with identifiable moral/Decalogue content, ZERO have a qualifier marking them as ceremonial. Of the 6 occurrences with ceremonial or human content, ALL have an explicit qualifier (sarkines, en dogmasin, anthropon, or Levitical context). The pattern is: entole WITHOUT qualifier = moral content; entole WITH qualifier = ceremonial or other content.

## II. Systematic Mapping Table: Dogma (G1378) + Dogmatizo (G1379) -- Complete Set

| # | Passage | Greek Form | Identifiable Content | Category | Affirm/Abolish |
|---|---------|------------|----------------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Luk 2:1 | dogma | Census decree from Caesar Augustus | Civil | Neutral |
| 2 | Acts 16:4 | dogmata | Jerusalem Council decisions (Acts 15:28-29: abstain from idols, blood, strangled, fornication) | Ecclesiastical | Neutral |
| 3 | Acts 17:7 | dogmata | Decrees of Caesar (Roman imperial law) | Civil | Neutral |
| 4 | Eph 2:15 | dogmasin | The regulations creating the Jew-Gentile barrier (circumcision, dietary laws, purity rules) | Ceremonial | **ABOLISHED** |
| 5 | Col 2:14 | dogmasin | "Handwriting of ordinances" -- content specified in vv.16-17: meat, drink, holyday, new moon, sabbath days = "shadow" | Ceremonial | **ABOLISHED** |
| 6 | Col 2:20 | dogmatizesthe (verb) | "Touch not; taste not; handle not" = dietary/purity regulations (vv.21-22) | Ceremonial | **ABOLISHED** |

### Dogma Content Distribution

| Category | Count | Content |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Civil decree | 2 | Caesar's census (Luk 2:1), Caesar's laws (Acts 17:7) |
| Ecclesiastical decree | 1 | Jerusalem Council (Acts 16:4) |
| Ceremonial (abolished) | 3 | Eph 2:15, Col 2:14, Col 2:20 |
| Moral/Decalogue | **0** | **None** |

**KEY FINDING:** Dogma is NEVER used for God's moral commandments (the Decalogue) in any NT passage. Its uses divide into civil decrees (2), ecclesiastical decisions (1), and abolished ceremonial regulations (3). In every abolition passage, dogma identifies the ceremonial regulations that ceased.

---

## III. Systematic Mapping Table: Dikaioma (G1345) -- Complete Set (10 Occurrences)

| # | Passage | Greek Form | Number | Article | Identifiable Content | Category | Affirm/Abolish |
|---|---------|------------|--------|---------|----------------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Luk 1:6 | dikaiOmasin | Plural | Articular (after kai) | OT ordinances (alongside entole as separate category) | General | Neutral |
| 2 | Rom 1:32 | to dikaiOma | Singular | Articular | God's righteous decree re: moral vice list (vv.29-31) | Moral | Affirmed |
| 3 | Rom 2:26 | ta dikaiOmata | Plural | Articular | The law's moral requirements kept by uncircumcised | Moral | Affirmed |
| 4 | Rom 5:16 | dikaiOma | Singular | Anarthrous | Forensic justification | Not law-referent | Neutral |
| 5 | Rom 5:18 | dikaiOmatos | Singular | Anarthrous | Christ's righteous act | Not law-referent | Neutral |
| 6 | Rom 8:4 | to dikaiOma | **Singular** | **Articular** | THE righteous requirement of THE law (connected to Decalogue in Rom 7:7) | **Moral** | **Affirmed** |
| 7 | Heb 9:1 | dikaiOmata | **Plural** | Anarthrous | Ordinances of divine service (sanctuary furnishings, priestly service) | **Ceremonial** | Neutral |
| 8 | Heb 9:10 | dikaiOmata | **Plural** | Anarthrous | Carnal ordinances: meats, drinks, washings | **Ceremonial** | **Abolished** |
| 9 | Rev 15:4 | ta dikaiOmata | Plural | Articular | God's righteous judgments made manifest | Not law-referent | Neutral |
| 10 | Rev 19:8 | ta dikaiOmata | Plural | Articular | Righteous deeds of saints | Not law-referent | Neutral |

### Dikaioma Pattern Analysis: Law-Referent Passages Only

Isolating the 6 passages where dikaioma refers to a specific law or legal standard:

| Passage | Number/Article | Content | Category |
|---------|----------------|---------|----------|
| Luk 1:6 | Plural/Articular | General OT ordinances | General |
| Rom 1:32 | Singular/Articular | God's decree against moral vice | Moral |
| Rom 2:26 | Plural/Articular | Law's moral requirements | Moral |
| Rom 8:4 | **Singular/Articular** | THE righteous requirement of THE law | **Moral** |
| Heb 9:1 | **Plural/Anarthrous + latreias** | Ordinances of divine service | **Ceremonial** |
| Heb 9:10 | **Plural/Anarthrous + sarkos** | Carnal ordinances | **Ceremonial** |

**Within law-referent contexts:**
- Singular articular (to dikaioma) -> moral standard (Rom 1:32; Rom 8:4)
- Plural + genitive modifier -> ceremonial ordinances (Heb 9:1 "of service"; Heb 9:10 "of flesh")
- Rom 2:26 is plural articular without modifier but in moral context (the law's requirements generally)
- Luk 1:6 is plural articular but in comprehensive OT context (entole + dikaioma as two categories)

**In non-law-referent contexts the pattern does not hold:**
- Rev 15:4 and 19:8: plural articular but = righteous acts (not ceremonial)
- Rom 5:16,18: singular anarthrous but = forensic act (not moral law)

**KEY FINDING:** The singular/plural pattern holds in law-referent passages: singular articular dikaioma = moral standard; plural with modifier = ceremonial ordinances. The pattern is contextual to law-referent passages, not absolute across all uses.

---

## IV. Systematic Mapping Table: Cheirographon (G5498) -- The Single Occurrence

| Passage | Greek | Content Identification Evidence | Category | Affirm/Abolish |
|---------|-------|---------------------------------|----------|----------------|
| Col 2:14 | to cheirographon tois dogmasin | See below | Ceremonial | ABOLISHED |

### Content Identification Evidence for Cheirographon

Five converging textual indicators identify the content:

1. **Etymology:** cheir (hand) + grapho (write) = "hand-written document." The Decalogue was "written with the finger of God" (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10) -- not hand-written. Moses' book of the law was hand-written: "when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book" (Deu 31:24).

2. **Paired with dogmasin:** The cheirographon is qualified by "tois dogmasin" (the ordinances/decrees). Dogma, as shown in Section II, is never used for the Decalogue.

3. **Contextual content (Col 2:16-17):** Paul specifies what the abolished regulations concerned: "meat, drink, holyday, new moon, sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come." These are ceremonial calendar and dietary regulations.

4. **Contextual content (Col 2:20-22):** Paul further identifies the regulations as "Touch not; taste not; handle not -- which all are to perish with the using -- after the commandments and doctrines of men." This is dietary/purity regulation, not moral law.

5. **"Against us" language:** The cheirographon is "kath' hemon" (against us) and "hupenantion hemin" (contrary to us). Moses placed the book of the law "in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee" (Deu 31:26).

**KEY FINDING:** The identifiable content of cheirographon is the hand-written regulatory code (Moses' book of the law), not the Decalogue (which was God-written). The context identifies ceremonial regulations (meat, drink, feasts, shadow-types) as the content that was nailed to the cross.

## V. Systematic Mapping Table: Nomos (G3551) -- Selected Content-Identifiable Passages

### A. Articular (ho nomos) with Identifiable Moral Content

| # | Passage | Article | Identified Content | Category | Affirm/Abolish |
|---|---------|---------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Rom 7:7 | YES | 10th commandment quoted | Moral | Affirmed |
| 2 | Rom 7:12 | YES | Same law as v.7; "holy, just, good" | Moral | Affirmed |
| 3 | Rom 7:14 | YES | Same law; "spiritual" | Moral | Affirmed |
| 4 | Rom 8:4 | YES | Righteous requirement of the law (dikaioma tou nomou) | Moral | Affirmed |
| 5 | Rom 8:7 | YES | "Law of God" -- carnal mind cannot submit | Moral | Affirmed |
| 6 | Rom 13:8-10 | Mixed | Decalogue commands 7,6,8,9,10 listed | Moral | Affirmed |
| 7 | Gal 5:14 | YES | "Love thy neighbour as thyself" | Moral | Affirmed |
| 8 | Jas 1:25 | YES | "Perfect law of liberty" (Jas 2:8-12 = Decalogue) | Moral | Affirmed |
| 9 | Jas 2:8-12 | YES | "Royal law"; commands 7 and 6 cited | Moral | Affirmed |

### B. Articular (ho nomos) with Potentially Ceremonial/Temporal Content

| # | Passage | Article | Identified Content | Category | Affirm/Abolish |
|---|---------|---------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| 10 | Gal 3:19 | YES | "The law" added till the seed should come | Mosaic system | Temporal |
| 11 | Gal 3:24-25 | YES | "The law" as schoolmaster to Christ | Mosaic system | Temporal |
| 12 | Heb 7:11-12 | YES | Law connected to Levitical priesthood | Ceremonial | Changed |
| 13 | Heb 10:1 | YES | "A shadow of good things to come" (sacrifices) | Ceremonial | Temporal |

### C. Anarthrous (nomos) as Principle/General

| # | Passage | Article | Identified Content | Category | Affirm/Abolish |
|---|---------|---------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| 14 | Rom 3:27 | NO | "Law of works" / "law of faith" = principles | Principle | Neutral |
| 15 | Rom 7:21 | Articular (but principle) | "A law" = operating principle of sin | Principle | Neutral |
| 16 | Rom 7:23 | Mixed | "Another law" / "law of my mind" / "law of sin" | Principle | Neutral |
| 17 | Rom 8:2 | YES (both) | "Law of Spirit of life" / "law of sin and death" | Principle | Neutral |
| 18 | Gal 2:16 | NO | "Works of law" | General | Neutral |
| 19 | Gal 2:19 | NO | "Through law dead to law" | General | Neutral |
| 20 | Gal 3:21 | NO | "If a law" (hypothetical) | Hypothetical | Neutral |

### D. New Covenant: Laws on Hearts

| # | Passage | Article | Identified Content | Category | Affirm/Abolish |
|---|---------|---------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| 21 | Heb 8:10 | NO (anarthrous plural: nomous mou) | "My laws" written on hearts (Jer 31:33) | Moral | Affirmed |
| 22 | Heb 10:16 | NO (anarthrous plural: nomous mou) | Same Jeremiah quotation | Moral | Affirmed |

### Nomos Article Pattern Analysis

| Article Pattern | Moral Content | Ceremonial/Temporal | Principle | Total |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------|-------|
| Articular (ho nomos) | 9 | 4 | 1 | 14 |
| Anarthrous (nomos) | 2 (Heb 8:10; 10:16) | 0 | 5 | 7 |
| Mixed in same context | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

**KEY FINDING:** The article pattern is a tendency, not an absolute rule. Articular nomos predominantly refers to a specific identifiable referent (the Mosaic law, whether moral or ceremonial in context). Anarthrous nomos can mean "law-as-principle" (Rom 3:27; 8:2) or "God's laws" (Heb 8:10; 10:16). The article does NOT cleanly divide moral from ceremonial -- Gal 3:19 and Heb 7:11-12 and Heb 10:1 use articular nomos for what was temporal/ceremonial.

---

## VI. Vocabulary Partition: Affirming vs. Abolishing Passages

### Affirming/Continuing Passages -- Vocabulary Used

| Greek Term | Passages |
|------------|----------|
| entole (unqualified) | Mat 5:19; 15:3; 19:17-19; 22:36-40; Mar 7:8; 10:19; 12:28-31; Luk 18:20; 23:56; Rom 7:8-13; 13:9; 1 Cor 7:19; Eph 6:2; 1 Jhn 2:3-4; 2:7; 3:22-24; 4:21; 5:2-3; 2 Jhn 1:4-6; Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14 |
| nomos (articular, moral context) | Rom 3:31; 7:12,14; 8:7; Jas 1:25; 2:8-12 |
| dikaioma (singular articular) | Rom 8:4 |
| anomia | 1 Jhn 3:4 ("sin is transgression of the law") |
| nomos (anarthrous, "my laws") | Heb 8:10; 10:16 (written on hearts) |

### Abolishing/Cessation Passages -- Vocabulary Used

| Greek Term | Passages |
|------------|----------|
| dogma / dogmasin | Eph 2:15; Col 2:14 |
| dogmatizo | Col 2:20 |
| cheirographon | Col 2:14 |
| dikaioma (plural + modifier) | Heb 9:1 (dikaiomata latreias); 9:10 (dikaiomata sarkos) |
| skia (shadow) | Col 2:17; Heb 8:5; 10:1 |
| entole + qualifier | Eph 2:15 (en dogmasin); Heb 7:16 (sarkines) |
| entalma (not entole) | Mat 15:9; Mar 7:7; Col 2:22 ("commandments of men") |
| katargeo | Eph 2:15 (subject = enmity/barrier via dogma-qualified entole) |

### Vocabulary Partition Matrix

| Term | Used in Affirmation? | Used in Abolition? | Overlap? |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|----------|
| entole (unqualified) | YES (43 occurrences) | NO | No overlap |
| entole + qualifier | NO | YES (sarkines, en dogmasin) | No overlap |
| dogma / dogmatizo | NO | YES (3 occurrences) | No overlap |
| cheirographon | NO | YES (1 occurrence) | No overlap |
| dikaioma (sg. articular) | YES (Rom 8:4) | NO | No overlap |
| dikaioma (pl. + modifier) | NO | YES (Heb 9:1,10) | No overlap |
| nomos | YES (articular, moral) | YES (articular, temporal) | **OVERLAPS** |
| skia | NO | YES (Col 2:17; Heb 10:1) | No overlap |
| anomia | YES (1 Jhn 3:4) | NO | No overlap |

**KEY FINDING:** Of the five core law terms, four (entole, dogma, cheirographon, dikaioma) show a consistent vocabulary partition between affirmation and abolition passages. The only term that overlaps both categories is nomos, which has a broad semantic range (Paul uses it in at least four distinct senses, per law-16/law-20). However, when nomos appears in affirmation passages, the identified content is moral law (Decalogue commands); when it appears in temporal/cessation passages (Gal 3:19; Heb 7:11-12; 10:1), the identified content is the regulatory/ceremonial system.

---

## VII. Exception Audit: Passages That Potentially Break the Pattern

### Exception 1: Hebrews 7:16,18 -- Entole for Levitical Law

**Text:** "Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment [entoles sarkines]" (Heb 7:16); "For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment [entoles] going before" (Heb 7:18).

**Analysis:** Heb 7:16 uses entole WITH the qualifier "sarkines" (carnal/fleshly). This qualifier marks the commandment as ceremonial (Levitical priesthood succession). Heb 7:18 refers back to the same commandment identified in v.16. The pattern is preserved: entole for ceremonial content requires a qualifier.

**Verdict:** Pattern holds. The qualifier "sarkines" is present.

### Exception 2: Hebrews 9:19 -- "Every Precept" (pasan entolen)

**Text:** "For when Moses had spoken every precept [pasan entolen] to all the people according to the law..."

**Analysis:** "Every precept" (pasan entolen) refers to ALL the commands Moses spoke at Sinai (Exo 24:3-8), encompassing both moral and ceremonial instructions. This does not break the pattern because it does not single out a ceremonial command and call it entole without qualification -- it refers to the totality of what Moses delivered, as a historical report. The qualifier is "pasan" (every/all), indicating comprehensiveness rather than identifying specific ceremonial content.

**Verdict:** Pattern not broken. This is a comprehensive reference, not an identification of ceremonial content as unqualified entole.

### Exception 3: Hebrews 7:5 -- Levitical Tithe Commandment

**Text:** "And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment [entolen] to take tithes of the people according to the law."

**Analysis:** This refers to the Levitical tithe law, which is institutional/ceremonial. The entole here lacks a pejorative qualifier like "sarkines," but the Levitical context is explicit. The text does not apply cessation language to this entole. It states that the Levitical priests "have" (present tense in Greek, narrative) this commandment. The passage does not say this commandment is abolished; the abolition language comes later (v.18) for the succession commandment identified in v.16 with "sarkines."

**Verdict:** This is a borderline case. The entole refers to a Levitical regulation without the "sarkines" qualifier of v.16. However, the Levitical context itself serves as a contextual identifier, and the passage does not apply cessation vocabulary to this particular entole. The pattern is that CESSATION of entole always requires a qualifier; this verse does not state cessation.

### Exception 4: Galatians 3:19 -- Articular Nomos for "Added" Law

**Text:** "Wherefore then serveth the law [ho nomos]? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come."

**Analysis:** Ho nomos (articular) is used for "the law" that was "added" with a temporal limit. If the article always signaled moral law, this would mean the moral law was temporary. The text says "the law" was added 430 years after the Abrahamic promise (v.17) and served until the seed came. The Continues position reads "the law" here as the regulatory/ceremonial system added to govern transgressions until Christ. The Abolished position reads it as the entire Mosaic code including the Decalogue.

**Verdict:** The article pattern (articular = moral) does NOT hold in Galatians 3:19. This is an acknowledged exception. The articular nomos can refer to the Mosaic system broadly, not just the moral law.

### Exception 5: 2 Corinthians 3:7-11 -- Ministry of Death on Stones

**Text:** "But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious...which glory was to be done away..."

**Analysis:** The grammar is determinative. The subject of katargeo ("done away") is NOT the law or the commandments. Parsing confirms: "he diakonia tou thanatou" (the ministry of death) is the subject; "ten katargoumenen" modifies "ten doxan" (the glory). What was "done away" is the GLORY of the old ministry, not the law written on stones. The passage contrasts two MINISTRIES (diakonia), not two laws. The law itself is not the grammatical object of katargeo in this passage.

**Verdict:** Pattern not broken. The text does not use entole, dogma, dikaioma, or nomos for what ceases. The cessation applies to the ministry/glory, not the law.

### Exception 6: Romans 7:4,6 -- "Dead to the Law"

**Text:** "Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ" (v.4); "But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held" (v.6).

**Analysis:** Paul uses nomos (articular) and then in v.7 identifies the law as the Decalogue ("Thou shalt not covet"). This appears to say believers are "dead to" the moral law. However, Paul's following argument (vv.12-14) states the same law is "holy, just, good, spiritual." The "dead to the law" language describes a change in the believer's relationship to the law (death to its condemnation), not the abolition of the law itself. Paul uses the marriage analogy (vv.1-3): the wife is free from the law of the husband when he dies -- but the law of marriage still exists. This does not use cessation vocabulary (dogma, cheirographon, katargeo of the law itself).

**Verdict:** Pattern not broken. The vocabulary of affirmation (nomos as "holy, just, good, spiritual") is applied to the same law that the believer is "dead to." The passage does not use cessation terms to abolish the moral law.

## VIII. Consolidated Pattern Assessment

### A. Entole Pattern Consistency

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Entole (unqualified) refers to moral/Decalogue content? | YES -- 43/43 identifiable occurrences |
| Entole for ceremonial content always has qualifier? | YES -- sarkines (Heb 7:16), en dogmasin (Eph 2:15), anthropon (Tit 1:14) |
| Exceptions found? | Heb 7:5 (borderline -- Levitical tithe without sarkines, but no cessation applied); Heb 9:19 (comprehensive "every precept") |
| Pattern consistency: | 98.4% (63/64 identifiable occurrences follow the pattern; 1 borderline) |

### B. Dogma Pattern Consistency

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Dogma used for moral/Decalogue content? | NO -- 0/6 occurrences |
| Dogma used for civil decrees? | YES -- 2/6 |
| Dogma used for ecclesiastical decrees? | YES -- 1/6 |
| Dogma used for abolished ceremonial content? | YES -- 3/6 |
| Exceptions found? | NONE |
| Pattern consistency: | 100% (6/6 occurrences follow the pattern) |

### C. Dikaioma Pattern Consistency (Law-Referent Passages)

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Singular articular = moral standard? | YES -- Rom 1:32; 8:4 (2/2) |
| Plural + modifier = ceremonial? | YES -- Heb 9:1 (latreias); 9:10 (sarkos) (2/2) |
| Exceptions in law-referent contexts? | Rom 2:26 (plural articular, moral); Luk 1:6 (plural articular, general) |
| Pattern consistency (strict): | 4/6 in law-referent contexts follow the singular/plural pattern |
| Note: | The pattern is contextual, not absolute; modifier presence is the stronger indicator |

### D. Cheirographon Pattern Consistency

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Used for moral/Decalogue content? | NO |
| Used for hand-written regulatory document? | YES (etymological + contextual evidence) |
| Exceptions found? | NONE (hapax -- only 1 occurrence) |
| Pattern consistency: | 100% (1/1) but sample size = 1 |

### E. Nomos Article Pattern Consistency

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Articular = always moral? | NO -- Gal 3:19,24-25; Heb 7:11-12; 10:1 are articular but ceremonial/temporal |
| Anarthrous = always principle? | NO -- Heb 8:10; 10:16 are anarthrous but = God's moral laws on hearts |
| Tendency observed? | YES -- articular more often identifies a specific known referent; anarthrous often shifts toward qualitative/generic |
| Pattern consistency: | TENDENCY, not absolute rule; nomos has the broadest semantic range of the five terms |

### F. Vocabulary Partition Between Affirm and Abolish Passages

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Terms used ONLY in affirmation: | entole (unqualified), dikaioma (sg. articular), anomia |
| Terms used ONLY in abolition: | dogma, dogmatizo, cheirographon, dikaioma (pl. + modifier), skia, entole + qualifier |
| Terms used in BOTH: | nomos (broad semantic range) |
| Partition consistency: | 4 of 5 core terms partition cleanly; 1 (nomos) overlaps both categories |

## IX. Does the Vocabulary Pattern Constitute a Textual Distinction?

### Data Summary

The mapping table documents the following distribution:

1. **Entole (G1785):** 43 unqualified occurrences with moral content; 6 qualified occurrences with ceremonial/human content. Pattern consistency: 98.4%.

2. **Dogma (G1378):** 0 occurrences with moral content; 3 occurrences with ceremonial content (all abolished); 3 with civil/ecclesiastical content. Pattern consistency: 100%.

3. **Dikaioma (G1345):** In law-referent passages, singular articular = moral (2/2); plural with modifier = ceremonial (2/2). Pattern is contextual, not absolute across all uses.

4. **Cheirographon (G5498):** 1 occurrence. Etymological and contextual evidence identifies content as hand-written ceremonial code, not the God-written Decalogue.

5. **Nomos (G3551):** The article pattern is a tendency, not an absolute rule. Nomos has the broadest semantic range and overlaps both affirmation and abolition categories.

### The Question of "Textual" vs. "External" Distinction

The data shows that the vocabulary partition exists IN the text itself:
- NT authors use different terms when affirming vs. abolishing
- The terms used for affirmation (entole unqualified, dikaioma singular articular) are never used for abolition
- The terms used for abolition (dogma, cheirographon, dikaioma plural + modifier) are never used for moral affirmation
- When entole IS used for abolished content, the text adds a qualifier (sarkines, en dogmasin)

This pattern was not imposed by an external theological framework; it is observable from the text's own vocabulary choices. The question is whether the pattern is *consistent enough* to constitute a distinction.

**Consistency assessment:**
- Entole: 98.4% consistent (1 borderline case: Heb 7:5)
- Dogma: 100% consistent
- Cheirographon: 100% consistent (but n=1)
- Dikaioma: Consistent in law-referent contexts; contextual, not absolute
- Nomos: Tendency only, not consistent enough to serve as a categorical marker

**Four of five terms show consistent vocabulary-to-content correlation.** The one term that does not (nomos) is also the one with the broadest semantic range, used by Paul in at least four distinct senses. The distinction is textually observable; whether it was *intentionally designed* as a categorical system is a separate question that the text does not explicitly answer.
