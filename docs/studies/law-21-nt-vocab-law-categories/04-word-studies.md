#### KEY FINDING: Entole WITHOUT qualifier
- When entole is used WITHOUT a qualifying term (sarkines, en dogmasin, "of men"), the identifiable content is ALWAYS moral/Decalogue or divine instruction
- The ONLY occurrences where entole refers to ceremonial/abolished content have an explicit qualifier:
  - Eph 2:15: qualified by "en dogmasin" (in ordinances)
  - Heb 7:16: qualified by "sarkines" (carnal/fleshly)
  - Tit 1:14: qualified by "anthropon" (of men)

#### LXX Background
- mitsvah (H4687) maps to entole (G1785) 153x in LXX (highest mapping)
- torah (H8451) also maps to entole 23x in LXX
- choq (H2706) maps to entole 22x in LXX
- chuqqah (H2708) maps to entole 23x in LXX

### 2. dogma (G1378) -- "decree, ordinance"

**Original:** dogma (neuter noun)
**Transliteration:** dogma
**Definition:** From the base of [G1380](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1380/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dokeo); a law (civil, ceremonial or ecclesiastical)
**BLB Count:** 5 occurrences
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun

#### KJV Translations
| Translation | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| decrees | 2 (Acts 16:4; 17:7) |
| a decree | 1 (Luke 2:1) |
| ordinances | 1 (Eph 2:15) |
| of ordinances | 1 (Col 2:14) |

#### Complete Content-Identification Table

| # | Passage | Greek Form | Identifiable Content | Category | Affirm/Abolish |
|---|---------|------------|---------------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Luk 2:1 | dogma | Census decree from Caesar Augustus | Civil | Neutral |
| 2 | Acts 16:4 | dogmata | Jerusalem Council decisions (15:28-29) | Ecclesiastical | Neutral |
| 3 | Acts 17:7 | dogmata | Decrees of Caesar (Roman law) | Civil | Neutral |
| 4 | Eph 2:15 | dogmasin | What created Jew-Gentile barrier | Ceremonial | **ABOLISHED** |
| 5 | Col 2:14 | dogmasin | Handwriting of ordinances; shadow regulations | Ceremonial | **ABOLISHED** |

#### KEY FINDING
- Dogma is NEVER used for God's moral commandments (the Decalogue)
- Its uses divide cleanly: civil decrees (2x), ecclesiastical decisions (1x), abolished ceremonial regulations (2x)
- In the two "abolished" passages, dogma identifies the ceremonial regulations that ceased at the cross

### dogmatizo (G1379) -- "to subject to ordinances"

**Original:** dogmatizo (verb)
**Transliteration:** dogmatizo
**Definition:** From [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dogma); to prescribe by statute, i.e. (reflexively) to submit to ceremonial rules
**BLB Count:** 1 occurrence
**Part of Speech:** verb

| Passage | Greek Form | Content | Category | Affirm/Abolish |

### 3. dikaioma (G1345) -- "ordinance, righteous requirement, righteous act"

**BLB Count:** 10 occurrences
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun

#### KJV Translations
| Translation | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| ordinances | 3 (Luk 1:6; Heb 9:1; Heb 9:10) |
| righteousness | 3 (Rom 2:26; Rom 8:4; Rev 19:8) |
| judgment | 1 (Rom 1:32) |
| justification | 1 (Rom 5:16) |
| the righteousness | 1 (Rom 5:18) |
| judgments | 1 (Rev 15:4) |

|---|---------|------------|--------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Luk 1:6 | dikaiOmasin | Plural | With article | OT ordinances (with entole as separate category) | General | Neutral |
| 2 | Rom 1:32 | to dikaiOma | Singular | Articular | God's decree re: moral vice list | Moral | Affirmed |
| 3 | Rom 2:26 | ta dikaiOmata | Plural | Articular | The law's righteous requirements | Moral | Affirmed |
| 4 | Rom 5:16 | dikaiOma | Singular | Anarthrous | Forensic justification | Not law-referent | Neutral |
| 5 | Rom 5:18 | dikaiOmatos | Singular | Anarthrous | Christ's righteous act | Not law-referent | Neutral |
| 6 | Rom 8:4 | to dikaiOma | **Singular** | **Articular** | THE righteous requirement of THE law | **Moral** | **Affirmed** |
| 7 | Heb 9:1 | dikaiOmata | **Plural** | Anarthrous | Ordinances of divine service | **Ceremonial** | Neutral |
| 8 | Heb 9:10 | dikaiOmata | **Plural** | Anarthrous | Carnal ordinances (meats, drinks, washings) | **Ceremonial** | **Abolished** |
| 9 | Rev 15:4 | ta dikaiOmata | Plural | Articular | God's righteous judgments | Not law-referent | Neutral |
| 10 | Rev 19:8 | ta dikaiOmata | Plural | Articular | Righteous deeds of saints | Not law-referent | Neutral |

#### KEY FINDINGS
**In law-referent contexts:**
- Singular articular (to dikaiOma): Rom 8:4 = moral standard (THE requirement of THE law)
- Plural with modifier: Heb 9:1 (dikaiOmata latreias = "ordinances of service"), Heb 9:10 (dikaiOmata sarkos = "carnal ordinances") = ceremonial
- The singular/plural pattern holds within law-referent passages

**In non-law-referent contexts:**
- The pattern breaks down: Rev 15:4 and 19:8 use plural for righteous acts (not ceremonial)
- Rom 5:16,18 use singular for justification/righteous act (not moral law)
- Therefore: The pattern is CONTEXTUAL to law-referent passages, not absolute

### 4. cheirographon (G5498) -- "handwriting, certificate of debt"

**Original:** cheirographon (neuter noun)
**Transliteration:** cheirographon
**Definition:** From cheir (G5495, hand) + grapho (G1125, write); something hand-written
**BLB Count:** 1 occurrence (hapax legomenon)
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun

#### The Single Occurrence

| Passage | Greek | Content Clues | Category |
|---------|-------|---------------|----------|
| Col 2:14 | to cheirographon tois dogmasin | Paired with dogma; context: meat/drink/holyday/new moon/sabbath = "shadow"; touch not/taste not = "commandments of men" | Ceremonial |

#### Etymology and Contrast
- cheir (hand) + grapho (write) = "hand-written document"
- Decalogue: "written with the finger of God" (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10)
- Book of the law: Moses "writing the words of this law in a book" (Deu 31:24) -- placed "in the side of the ark" as "a witness against thee" (Deu 31:26)
- cheirographon is "against us" (kath' hemon) and "contrary to us" (hupenantion hemin) -- matching Deu 31:26 "witness against thee"

#### Identification Evidence
1. Hand-written (cheiro-graphon) vs. God-written (finger of God)
2. Paired with tois dogmasin (the ordinances)
3. Context specifies ceremonial content (meat, drink, holyday, new moon, sabbath days = "shadow")
4. Continuation identifies content as dietary/purity ("Touch not; taste not; handle not")
5. Described as "commandments and doctrines of men" (entalma kai didaskalia ton anthropon)

### 5. nomos (G3551) -- "law, custom, principle"

**Original:** nomos (masculine noun)
**Transliteration:** nomos
**Definition:** From nemo (to parcel out); anything established, law, custom, command, ordinance
**BLB Count:** 197 occurrences (169 in TR database)
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)

#### KJV Translations

| Jas 2:8-12 | YES | "Royal law"; Decalogue commands | Moral | Affirmed |
| 1 Jhn 3:4 | (anomia) | Sin = transgression of the law | Moral | Affirmed |

#### KEY FINDING on Article Pattern
- The article (ho nomos) does NOT cleanly divide moral from ceremonial
- Articular nomos CAN refer to: (a) the moral law specifically (Rom 7:7); (b) the entire Mosaic system (Gal 3:19); (c) the Levitical system (Heb 7:11-12)
- Anarthrous nomos CAN refer to: (a) law-as-principle (Rom 3:27); (b) God's moral laws on hearts (Heb 8:10)
- TENDENCY: Articular tends toward specific known referent; anarthrous tends toward qualitative/generic. But the pattern is a tendency, NOT an absolute rule

#### LXX Background
- torah (H8451) maps to nomos (G3551) 188x in LXX (overwhelmingly dominant mapping)

- **Note:** Both dikaioma and nomos are singular and articular -- pointing to a specific, definite moral standard

### Hebrews 9:1
```
eiche men oun kai he prote dikaiomata latreias
had indeed therefore also the first [covenant] ordinances of-service
```
- dikaiomata (Acc Pl N, anarthrous): ordinances (plural, no article)
- latreias (Gen Sg F): of service/worship
- **Note:** Plural + genitive modifier "of service" = ceremonial ordinances

### Hebrews 9:10
```
dikaiomata sarkos mechri kairou diorthoseos epikeimena
ordinances of-flesh until [the] time of-reformation imposed
```
- dikaiomata (Nom Pl N, anarthrous): ordinances (plural, no article)
- sarkos (Gen Sg F): of flesh/carnal
- epikeimena (Pres M/P Ptcp): being imposed/laid upon
- **Note:** Plural + "of flesh" + temporal limit ("until the time of reformation") = ceremonial, temporary

### Luke 1:6
```
poreuomenoi en pasais tais entolais kai dikaiOmasin tou Kyriou amemptoi
walking in all the commandments and ordinances of-the Lord blameless
```
- tais entolais (Dat Pl F, articular): THE commandments
- kai dikaiOmasin (Dat Pl N, anarthrous after kai): and ordinances
- **Note:** entole and dikaioma listed as TWO DISTINCT categories; both "of the Lord"

### Romans 7:12
```
hoste ho men nomos hagios kai he entole hagia kai dikaia kai agathe
so-that the law [is] holy and the commandment holy and just and good
```
- ho nomos (Nom Sg M, articular): THE law
- he entole (Nom Sg F, articular): THE commandment
- **Note:** Both articular; the commandment (10th, from v.7) described as "holy, just, and good"

### Hebrews 7:16
```
hos ou kata nomon entoles sarkines gegonen
who not according-to [a] law of-commandment of-flesh has-become
```
- nomon (Acc Sg M, anarthrous): a law
- entoles (Gen Sg F): of commandment
- sarkines (Gen Sg F): of flesh/carnal -- QUALIFIER
- **Note:** entole WITH qualifier sarkines = fleshly/carnal commandment (Levitical succession)

### Galatians 3:19
```
Ti oun ho nomos; ton parabaseon charin prosetethe
What then the law? of-the transgressions on-account-of was-added
achris an elthe to sperma ho epengelstai
until [particle] should-come the seed to-whom it-has-been-promised
```
- ho nomos (Nom Sg M, articular): THE law
- prosetethe (Aor Pass Ind): was added
- **Note:** Articular nomos for what was "added" and temporal -- this challenges a rigid article = moral only rule

### 2 Corinthians 3:7
```
ei de he diakonia tou thanatou en grammasin entetypomene lithois egenethe en doxe
if the ministry of-death in letters having-been-engraved on-stones came-about in glory
...ten katargoumenen
...the [glory] being-done-away
```
- he diakonia (Nom Sg F): THE ministry (not "the law")
- tou thanatou (Gen Sg M): of death
- ten katargoumenen (Acc Sg F): the [glory] being done away -- katargeo modifies doxa (glory), not nomos
- **Critical:** The law itself is NOT the grammatical subject of katargeo. The MINISTRY and its GLORY are what transition.

### 1 Corinthians 7:19
```
he peritome ouden estin kai he akrobystia ouden estin alla teresis entolon Theou
the circumcision nothing is and the uncircumcision nothing is but keeping of-commandments of-God
```
- teresis (Nom Sg F): keeping/observance
- entolon (Gen Pl F, anarthrous): of commandments
- Theou (Gen Sg M): of God
- **Note:** Circumcision (ceremonial) explicitly CONTRASTED with entole (God's commandments)

## Vocabulary Pattern: Affirming vs. Abolishing Passages

### AFFIRMING/CONTINUING passages use:
| Term | Passages |
|------|----------|
| nomos (articular) | Rom 3:31; 7:12,14; 8:7; Jas 1:25; 2:8-12 |
| entole (unqualified) | Rom 7:12; 13:9; 1 Cor 7:19; Eph 6:2; Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14; all of 1 John |
| dikaioma (singular articular) | Rom 8:4 |
| anomia | 1 Jhn 3:4 (sin = law-breaking) |
| nomos (anarthrous "my laws") | Heb 8:10; 10:16 (on hearts) |

### ABOLISHING/CESSATION passages use:
| Term | Passages |
|------|----------|
| dogma / dogmasin | Eph 2:15; Col 2:14 |
| dogmatizo | Col 2:20 |
| cheirographon | Col 2:14 |
| dikaioma (plural + modifier) | Heb 9:1 (latreias); 9:10 (sarkos) |
| skia (shadow) | Col 2:17; Heb 8:5; 10:1 |
| entole + qualifier | Eph 2:15 (en dogmasin); Heb 7:16 (sarkines) |
| entalma (not entole) | Mat 15:9; Mar 7:7; Col 2:22 ("commandments of men") |
| katargeo | Eph 2:15 (subject = the enmity/barrier, via dogma-qualified entole) |

### KEY OBSERVATION
The affirming and abolishing passages use largely DIFFERENT vocabulary:
- **Affirming** uses: entole (unqualified), nomos, dikaioma (singular articular)
- **Abolishing** uses: dogma, cheirographon, dikaioma (plural + modifier), skia, entole ONLY with qualifier
- The vocabulary partition is remarkably consistent
