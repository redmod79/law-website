## Law-20: NT Greek Law Vocabulary (Direct Predecessor)
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-20-nt-greek-law-vocabulary/CONCLUSION.md
- Established lexical data for five core Greek law terms
- 32 Explicit Statements, 9 Necessary Implications, 8 Inferences
- Key findings referenced in PROMPT.md (see Prior Study Analysis section)
- Law-20 answered: "What do the Greek terms mean and how are they distributed?"
- Law-21 extends: "When we CAN identify which specific law is being discussed, does the vocabulary consistently correlate?"

## Law-06: Hebrew Law Vocabulary (OT Companion)
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-06-hebrew-law-vocabulary/CONCLUSION.md
- Hebrew law terms describe FORMAL CHARACTER (instruction, command, decree, judgment, testimony), NOT moral categories
- No Hebrew term means exclusively "moral law" or "ceremonial law"
- Torah->nomos and mitsvah->entole are stable LXX mappings
- LXX compressed Hebrew distinctions; NT Greek has LESS precision than OT Hebrew
- Dikaioma (G1345) is LXX catch-all for seven different Hebrew law terms

## NT Commandments vs Ordinances (Directly Overlapping)
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/nt-commandments-vs-ordinances/CONCLUSION.md
- NT authors use entole for moral commands, dogma for ceremonial
- Dogma NEVER used for God's moral commandments
- Entole: 71 NT occurrences, consistently moral
- Dogma: 5 NT occurrences (civil decrees or abolished ordinances)
- Dikaioma: 10 NT occurrences, dual range
- Luke 1:6 uses entole AND dikaioma as two categories
- Eph 2:15 narrowing: ton nomon -> ton entolon -> en dogmasin
- Did NOT produce the systematic mapping table law-21 requires

## Law-08: Abolished at Cross
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-08-abolished-at-cross/CONCLUSION.md
- Each abolition passage identifies its referent through specific Greek vocabulary
- None names the Decalogue
- Col 2:14: cheirographon tois dogmasin
- Eph 2:15: ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin
- Cheirographon = "hand-written" (hapax) vs Decalogue = God-written
- Dogma/cheirographon form "cessation vocabulary" separate from entole/nomos for moral law

## Law-16: Paul and Law in Romans
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-16-paul-and-law-in-romans/CONCLUSION.md
- Paul uses nomos in at least four distinct senses
- Rom 8:4 singular dikaioma with article = THE righteous requirement of THE law
- Articular ho nomos typically = specific Mosaic law
- Anarthrous nomos can = "law as principle" or "a law"

## Law-04: Ceremonial Laws
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-04-ceremonial-laws/CONCLUSION.md
- Comprehensive Contrast Table: Decalogue vs. ceremonial
- Dimensions: delivery, authorship, medium, repository, vocabulary
- NT consistently uses specific vocabulary for abolished items (dogma, dikaioma+sarkos, skia)

## Law-07: Law of Moses
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-07-law-of-moses/CONCLUSION.md
- All 21 "law of Moses" occurrences analyzed
- Dikaioma (G1345) all 10 NT occurrences with context table
- Vocabulary distribution pattern table: nomos, entole, dogma, dikaioma mapped to "Law of Moses" vs "Law of God" contexts
