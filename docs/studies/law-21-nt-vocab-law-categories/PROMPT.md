# law-21: How Does NT Vocabulary Distinguish Moral, Ceremonial, and Civil Law?

## Question
Does the NT vocabulary systematically distinguish moral law from ceremonial and/or civil law? Building on law-20's lexical findings, map every NT occurrence where these terms are used in a context where the specific law content is identifiable -- and determine whether a consistent pattern emerges. Investigate: (1) When entole is used positively ("keep the commandments"), is the identifiable content always moral/Decalogue? (2) When dogma/dogmasin appears in passages about what was abolished (Eph 2:15, Col 2:14), is the identifiable content always ceremonial/ritual? (3) When dikaioma appears in Heb 9:1,10, is it consistently ceremonial -- and when in Rom 8:4, is it moral? (4) What is cheirographon's identifiable content (Col 2:14)? (5) When nomos is used with the article vs without, does this correlate with moral vs principle/general? (6) Do NT authors use different Greek terms when affirming vs abolishing? Produce a systematic mapping table. Determine whether the vocabulary pattern is consistent enough to constitute a textual (not external) distinction.

## Series Context
This is study 21 in a 31-study series on the Law of God. The series investigates whether God's moral law (Ten Commandments, including Sabbath) continues or was abolished at the cross. Both positions agree ceremonial/civil laws ceased -- the debate is ONLY about the moral law.

## Prior Study Analysis

### CRITICAL: Relationship to law-20

**Law-20 (NT Greek Law Vocabulary)** is the direct predecessor study. It established the LEXICAL data -- definitions, distributions, occurrence counts, and grammar patterns for the five core Greek law terms (entole, nomos, dogma, cheirographon, dikaioma). Law-21 builds on law-20 by taking the NEXT step: mapping each term to its identifiable law content in every NT passage where the specific law being referenced is determinable. Law-20 answered "What do the Greek terms mean and how are they distributed?" Law-21 answers "When we CAN identify which specific law is being discussed, does the Greek vocabulary consistently correlate with the law's category (moral vs. ceremonial vs. civil)?"

**Key distinction:** Law-20 studied the VOCABULARY ITSELF. Law-21 studies the VOCABULARY-TO-CONTENT MAPPING. This means law-21 must:
- For every occurrence of entole where the specific commandment(s) can be identified, record what commandment(s) are in view
- For every occurrence of dogma where the specific regulation(s) can be identified, record what regulation(s) are in view
- For every occurrence of dikaioma where the specific content can be identified, record what content is in view
- For every occurrence of cheirographon, determine its identifiable referent
- For a representative sample of nomos passages where the specific law content is identifiable, record the article pattern and the identified content
- Produce a SYSTEMATIC MAPPING TABLE showing: Greek term | Passage | Identifiable Law Content | Category (moral/ceremonial/civil/general) | Affirmed or Abolished

### Law-20 Conclusions to Build On

Law-20's CONCLUSION.md (D:/bible/bible-studies/law-20-nt-greek-law-vocabulary/CONCLUSION.md) established:

**Explicit Statements (32 total):**
- E1-E6: Entole used for Decalogue content in Mat 19:17-19, Mar 10:19, Rom 7:12, Rom 13:9, 1 Cor 7:19, Eph 6:2
- E7-E8: Entole in Heb 7:16,18 for Levitical succession law WITH qualifier "sarkines"
- E9: Eph 2:15 uses entole qualified by "en dogmasin" for what was abolished
- E10: Luk 23:56 uses entole for Sabbath commandment
- E11-E15: Dogma's complete 5-occurrence distribution (civil decrees or abolished ceremonial)
- E16-E18: Cheirographon = "hand-written" vs. Decalogue = "written by finger of God"
- E19-E21: Dikaioma singular/articular (Rom 8:4 = moral standard) vs. plural/modified (Heb 9:1,10 = ceremonial)
- E22: Luke 1:6 lists entole and dikaioma as two distinct categories
- E23-E27: Entole in Revelation and 1 John for continuing commandments
- E28: Col 2:20-22 identifies dogmatizo regulations as dietary/purity
- E29-E31: Nomos articular/anarthrous patterns
- E32: James identifies "royal law" and "law of liberty" with Decalogue content

**Necessary Implications (9 total):**
- N1: Entole without qualifier is NEVER used for abolished ceremonial regulation (Continues)
- N2: Dogma is NEVER used for God's moral commandments (Continues)
- N3: Cheirographon (hand-written) vs. Decalogue (God-written) = different authorship categories (Continues)
- N4: Dikaioma singular/articular vs. plural/modified = different grammatical forms in law contexts (Neutral)
- N5: Luke 1:6 lists entole and dikaioma as two distinct categories (Neutral)
- N6: Paul distinguishes entole from circumcision in 1 Cor 7:19 (Continues)
- N7: Eph 2:15 narrows progressively: law -> commandments -> in ordinances (Neutral)
- N8: Col 2:20-22 identifies dogmatizo content as dietary/purity (Neutral)
- N9: Paul uses nomos in at least four distinct senses (Neutral)

**Inferences (8 total):**
- I1 (I-A Continues): NT Greek vocabulary encodes a systematic moral/ceremonial distinction
- I2 (I-A Continues): Dogma/cheirographon exclusively for non-moral; entole (unqualified) exclusively for moral; therefore abolition passages abolish only ceremonial
- I3 (I-D Abolished): All NT law is a single undifferentiated unit; vocabulary differences are stylistic
- I4 (I-D Abolished): Cheirographon refers to the Decalogue
- I5 (I-C Neutral): Cheirographon is a metaphorical debt certificate (Greco-Roman background)
- I6 (I-B Neutral): Articular/anarthrous nomos signals theological distinction -- resolved Moderate, tendency not absolute
- I7 (I-B Neutral): Dikaioma singular/plural is absolute code -- resolved Strong against "absolute code" claim
- I8 (I-C Neutral): Greek vocabulary "proves" divinely intended categorical system

**I-B Resolutions from law-20:**
- I6: Article pattern is a tendency, not absolute rule. Articular nomos tends toward specific known referent; anarthrous nomos can shift toward qualitative/generic. But exceptions exist. Resolution: Neutral.
- I7: Singular/plural pattern holds within law-referent contexts (Rom 8:4 vs. Heb 9:1,10) but breaks down in non-law contexts (Rev 15:4; 19:8). Resolution: The qualified contextual pattern is valid; the "absolute code" claim fails.

### Law-06 Conclusions (OT Hebrew Companion)

Law-06 (D:/bible/bible-studies/law-06-hebrew-law-vocabulary/CONCLUSION.md) established:

- Hebrew law terms describe FORMAL CHARACTER (instruction, command, decree, judgment, testimony), NOT moral categories
- No Hebrew term means exclusively "moral law" or "ceremonial law"
- Torah->nomos and mitsvah->entole are stable LXX mappings
- LXX compressed Hebrew distinctions; NT Greek has LESS precision than OT Hebrew
- Dikaioma (G1345) is the LXX catch-all for seven different Hebrew law terms
- Eduth (testimony) has exclusive Decalogue association in Exodus narrative
- Distribution tendencies exist (chuqqah in feast legislation, mishpat in case law) but are not absolute boundaries

### Other Highly Relevant Prior Studies

#### nt-commandments-vs-ordinances (CRITICAL -- directly overlapping)
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/nt-commandments-vs-ordinances/CONCLUSION.md
- Found NT authors use entole for moral commands, dogma for ceremonial; dogma NEVER for God's moral commandments
- Entole: 71 NT occurrences; consistently moral; used for Decalogue in Rom 7:7-12, Mat 22:36-40, Rom 13:9
- Dogma: 5 NT occurrences; Caesar's decree (Luk 2:1, Acts 17:7), apostolic council (Acts 16:4), abolished ordinances (Eph 2:15, Col 2:14)
- Dikaioma: 10 NT occurrences; dual range -- ceremonial statutes (Heb 9:1,10) vs. righteous requirement (Rom 8:4)
- Luke 1:6 uses entole AND dikaioma side by side as two categories
- Eph 2:15 narrowing: ton nomon -> ton entolon -> en dogmasin
- This study ANALYZED the same vocabulary but did NOT produce the systematic mapping table that law-21 requires

#### law-08-abolished-at-cross
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-08-abolished-at-cross/CONCLUSION.md
- Each abolition passage identifies its referent through specific Greek vocabulary; none names the Decalogue
- Col 2:14 uses cheirographon tois dogmasin; Eph 2:15 uses ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin
- Cheirographon = "hand-written" (hapax); Decalogue = God-written (different authorships)
- Dogma/cheirographon form a "cessation vocabulary" separate from entole/nomos for moral law

#### law-16-paul-and-law-in-romans
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-16-paul-and-law-in-romans/CONCLUSION.md
- Paul uses nomos in at least four distinct senses: Torah/code, Decalogue specifically, operating principle, Pentateuch as Scripture-witness
- Rom 8:4 singular dikaioma with article = THE righteous requirement of THE law
- When articular ho nomos, typically means the Mosaic law as specific body; anarthrous can mean "law as principle" or "a law"

#### law-04-ceremonial-laws
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-04-ceremonial-laws/CONCLUSION.md
- Comprehensive Contrast Table: Decalogue vs. ceremonial across delivery, authorship, medium, repository, vocabulary dimensions
- NT consistently uses specific vocabulary for abolished items (dogma, dikaioma+sarkos, skia)

#### law-07-law-of-moses

## Key Research Angles

### Angle 1: The Systematic Mapping Table (CORE DELIVERABLE)

This is what makes law-21 unique from all prior studies. Law-20 established the VOCABULARY facts. Law-21 must map VOCABULARY to CONTENT.

**Build a comprehensive table with columns:**
| # | Greek Term | Strong's | Passage | Identifiable Law Content | Category | Affirmed/Abolished/Neutral |

**For each row:**
- "Identifiable Law Content" = the specific law(s) that can be determined from context (e.g., "Thou shalt not covet" = 10th commandment, "meats, drinks, washings" = sanctuary service regulations, "decree from Caesar" = civil decree, etc.)
- "Category" = moral (Decalogue/ethical), ceremonial (sacrificial/ritual/purity/feast), civil (governmental/imperial decree), or general (law-as-principle, cannot determine specific content)
- "Affirmed/Abolished/Neutral" = whether the passage presents this law as continuing, abolished, or neither

**Population rules:**
- For entole (G1785): All 71 occurrences. Only include in the mapping table those where content IS identifiable. Flag those where content is NOT identifiable.
- For dogma (G1378): All 5 occurrences + dogmatizo (G1379) 1 occurrence. Content MUST be determined for each.
- For cheirographon (G5498): The 1 occurrence. All identifiable content clues must be analyzed.
- For dikaioma (G1345): All 10 occurrences. Content must be determined for each.
- For nomos (G3551): Sample the passages where content IS identifiable (where Paul or another author quotes or specifies which law). Note article presence. Do NOT attempt all 197 occurrences -- focus on identifiable-content passages.

### Angle 2: Entole Content-Identification Audit

Go beyond law-20's pattern observation. For each entole occurrence where specific law content is named or clearly implied:
- Mat 19:17-19: "Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and mother" = Commandments 6,7,8,9,5
- Mar 10:19: Same Decalogue commands listed
- Rom 7:7,12: "Thou shalt not covet" = 10th commandment
- Rom 13:9: Five Decalogue commands listed
- 1 Cor 7:19: Entole distinguished FROM circumcision (ceremonial)
- Eph 6:2: "Honour thy father and mother" = 5th commandment
- Luk 23:56: Sabbath rest = 4th commandment
- Heb 7:16,18: Levitical priesthood succession law (WITH qualifier "sarkines")
- Eph 2:15: Entole qualified by "en dogmasin"
- Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14: "Commandments of God" -- content identifiable?
- 1 Jhn 2:3-4; 3:22-24; 5:2-3: "His commandments" -- content identifiable?
- Jhn 14:15,21; 15:10,12: "My commandments" (Jesus) -- content identifiable?
- Mat 22:36-40: Greatest commandment = love God, love neighbor
- Mat 15:3-6 / Mar 7:8-9: "Commandment of God" = 5th commandment vs. "tradition of men"
- Col 4:10: "Commandments" regarding Mark -- apostolic instruction

**Key question:** Is there ANY occurrence of entole WITHOUT a qualifier where the identifiable content is a ceremonial/ritual regulation that was abolished?

### Angle 3: Dogma Content-Identification Audit

For each of the 5 dogma occurrences:
- Luke 2:1: "A decree from Caesar Augustus" -- content: Roman census decree = civil
- Acts 16:4: "Decrees ordained of the apostles and elders" -- content: Jerusalem Council decisions (Acts 15:28-29) = ecclesiastical
- Acts 17:7: "Contrary to the decrees of Caesar" -- content: Roman imperial decrees = civil
- Eph 2:15: "The law of commandments in ordinances [en dogmasin]" -- content: what created the barrier between Jew and Gentile. What specific regulations created this barrier?
- Col 2:14: "The handwriting of ordinances [tois dogmasin]" -- content: Col 2:16-17 lists meat, drink, holyday, new moon, sabbath days as "shadow of things to come"; Col 2:20-22 lists "Touch not; taste not; handle not" = dietary/purity regulations

**Key question:** Is there ANY occurrence of dogma where the identifiable content is a moral/Decalogue commandment?

### Angle 4: Dikaioma Content-Identification Audit

For each of the 10 dikaioma occurrences:
- Luk 1:6: "Ordinances of the Lord" -- content: OT ordinances generally (Zechariah and Elisabeth walked in ALL)
- Rom 1:32: "Judgment/ordinance of God" -- content: preceding vice list (vv. 29-31) = moral violations
- Rom 2:26: "Righteousness/requirements of the law" -- content: the law's moral requirements kept by uncircumcised
- Rom 5:16: "Unto justification" -- content: forensic/legal acquittal (no specific law content)
- Rom 5:18: "By the righteousness of one" -- content: Christ's righteous act (no specific law content)
- Rom 8:4: "THE righteousness of THE law" -- content: connected to Rom 7:7 (Decalogue) = moral standard
- Heb 9:1: "Ordinances of divine service" -- content: sanctuary service regulations = ceremonial
- Heb 9:10: "Carnal ordinances" -- content: "meats and drinks, and divers washings" = ceremonial
- Rev 15:4: "Thy judgments are made manifest" -- content: God's righteous judgments (not ceremonial)
- Rev 19:8: "Righteousness of saints" -- content: righteous deeds of believers (not ceremonial)

**Key question:** Does the singular/plural pattern correlate with the moral/ceremonial distinction within law-referent passages?

### Angle 5: Cheirographon Content-Identification

For the single occurrence (Col 2:14):
- Etymology: cheir (hand) + grapho (write) = "hand-written document"
- Paired with "tois dogmasin" (the ordinances)
- Context: Col 2:16-17 specifies "meat, drink, holyday, new moon, sabbath days" as "shadow"
- Context: Col 2:20-22 specifies "Touch not; taste not; handle not" as "commandments and doctrines of men"
- Contrast: Decalogue was "written with the finger of God" (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10)
- Contrast: Moses wrote "the words of this law in a book" (Deu 31:24-26) and placed it "in the side of the ark"
- Question: Does cheirographon's identifiable content = the Mosaic handwritten code (book of the law), the Decalogue (God-written), or a metaphorical debt certificate (Greco-Roman legal background)?

### Angle 6: Nomos Article Pattern with Content Identification

For selected nomos passages where content IS identifiable:
- Rom 7:7: "THE law" (ho nomos) = 10th commandment (quoted) -- articular, moral
- Rom 7:12,14: "THE law" (ho nomos) = "holy, just, good, spiritual" -- articular, moral
- Rom 3:27: "Law of works" (nomou ergon) vs. "law of faith" (nomou pisteos) -- anarthrous, principle
- Rom 4:15: "THE law" (ho nomos) then anarthrous nomos in same verse
- Rom 8:2: "Law of the Spirit of life" vs. "law of sin and death" -- articular, principle
- Gal 3:19: "THE law" (ho nomos) = "added...till the seed should come" -- articular; content: ceremonial system?
- Gal 5:14: "ALL the law" (ho pas nomos) = "Love thy neighbour as thyself" -- articular, moral
- Heb 8:10; 10:16: "My laws" (nomous) = written on hearts -- anarthrous plural, moral
- Jas 1:25: "THE perfect law of liberty" -- articular, moral (Decalogue content in Jas 2:8-12)
- 1 Jhn 3:4: "Sin is the transgression of the law" (anomia) -- moral standard

**Key question:** Does the article pattern reliably correlate with moral vs. principle/general, or is it governed by standard Greek definiteness grammar?

### Angle 7: Vocabulary Pattern in Affirming vs. Abolishing Passages

Create a two-column comparison:

**Affirming/Continuing passages** (what Greek terms are used?):
- Rom 3:31 (nomos established)
- Rom 7:12,14 (nomos/entole holy, spiritual)
- Rom 8:4 (dikaioma of nomos fulfilled)
- Rom 13:9 (entole listed as obligations)
- 1 Cor 7:19 (entole keeping matters)
- Heb 8:10; 10:16 (nomos on hearts)
- Jas 1:25; 2:8-12 (nomos of liberty)
- 1 Jhn 3:4 (anomia = lawlessness)
- 1 Jhn 5:3 (entole not grievous)
- Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14 (entole kept)

**Abolishing/Cessation passages** (what Greek terms are used?):
- Eph 2:15 (entole qualified by en dogmasin -- katargeo)
- Col 2:14 (cheirographon tois dogmasin -- exaleipho, proseloo)
- Col 2:16-17 (skia -- shadow language, no specific law term for what ceases)
- Col 2:20-22 (dogmatizo -- "commandments and doctrines of men")
- Heb 9:1,10 (dikaiomata sarkos/latreias -- ceremonial ordinances)
- Heb 10:1,9 (skia -- "He taketh away the first")
- Gal 3:19 (nomos -- "added till the seed should come")

**Key question:** Do the affirming passages consistently use different Greek terms from the abolishing passages?

### Angle 8: Counter-Arguments and Exceptions

Must investigate passages that potentially BREAK the vocabulary pattern:
- Heb 7:16,18: Entole used for Levitical succession -- but with qualifier "sarkines." Does the qualifier save the pattern?
- Heb 9:19: "Every entole" -- does this include ceremonial commands?
- Gal 3:19: Articular ho nomos for what was "added till the seed should come" -- if articular = specific Mosaic code, this seems to abolish the code. Does the article pattern break here?
- 2 Cor 3:7-11: Ministry written on stones (= Decalogue context) described with katargeo language. Is this an exception where the moral law itself is abolished?
- Rom 7:4,6: "Dead to the law," "delivered from the law" -- the law here is likely the moral law (context: 10th commandment in v.7). How does this fit the vocabulary pattern?

## Differentiation from Prior Studies

**CRITICAL:** Law-21 is NOT a repetition of law-20 or nt-commandments-vs-ordinances. The unique contribution of law-21 is:

1. **The Systematic Mapping Table**: No prior study has produced a comprehensive table mapping every occurrence of entole, dogma, dikaioma, and cheirographon to its IDENTIFIABLE LAW CONTENT and then categorizing that content. Law-20 mapped vocabulary patterns; law-21 maps vocabulary to specific laws.

2. **Content-Identification Methodology**: Rather than observing that entole "tends to be moral," law-21 must go occurrence by occurrence and document: "In this passage, the specific law content identified is X, and X is [moral/ceremonial/civil]." The distinction is between PATTERN OBSERVATION (law-20) and CONTENT VERIFICATION (law-21).

3. **The "Systematic" Question**: Law-20 concluded that the vocabulary distribution exists but questioned whether it was "divinely intended as a deliberate categorical system" (I8, I-C). Law-21 must determine whether the pattern is CONSISTENT ENOUGH to constitute a textual distinction -- not whether it was intentionally designed, but whether it is observably consistent.

4. **Exception Audit**: Law-21 must rigorously test the pattern against every possible exception -- every passage where entole MIGHT refer to a ceremonial law that was abolished (without qualifier), every passage where dogma MIGHT refer to a moral law, every passage where dikaioma crosses categories.

5. **The Affirm/Abolish Vocabulary Comparison**: Which Greek terms appear in affirmation passages? Which appear in abolition passages? Is the vocabulary partition between these two groups consistent?

The research agent should REFERENCE law-20's data (do not re-derive what law-20 already established) but must EXTEND it by adding the content-identification layer and building the comprehensive mapping table.
