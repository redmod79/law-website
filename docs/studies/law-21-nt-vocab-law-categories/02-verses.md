- Content: Same Jeremiah quotation = moral law written on hearts
- Article: NO

## VI. OT Background Passages

**Exodus 20:1-17** -- The Decalogue (full text retrieved above)
- Spoken directly by God; written by God's finger

**Exodus 31:18** -- "And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God."
- Key: Decalogue = "written with the finger of God" (NOT hand-written)

**Deuteronomy 4:13** -- "And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, [even] ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone."
- Key: "His covenant" = "ten commandments" = God wrote them

**Deuteronomy 9:10** -- "And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them [was written] according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly."
- Key: "Written with the finger of God"

**Deuteronomy 31:24-26** -- "And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying, Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee."
- Key: Moses wrote this law in a book (HAND-written); placed "in the side of the ark" (not inside); "a witness AGAINST thee"
- Contrast: Decalogue was written by God and placed INSIDE the ark

**Jeremiah 31:31-34** -- "Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers...But this [shall be] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts..."
- Key: The new covenant involves God's law written on hearts -- moral law continues in a new mode

## VII. Counter-Argument / Exception Passages

**2 Corinthians 3:7-11** -- "But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away: How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which is done away [was] glorious, much more that which remaineth [is] glorious."
- Greek: he diakonia tou thanatou en grammasin entypomene lithois (the ministry of death in letters engraved on stones)
- Key: Uses katargeo for what is "done away" -- but the object is "the MINISTRY" (diakonia), not the law itself
- Greek parsing confirms: katargoumenen modifies ten doxan (the glory) in v.7, not the law
- Note: Does NOT use entole, dogma, dikaioma, or nomos for what ceases. Uses diakonia (ministry) and doxa (glory)

**Romans 7:4,6** -- "Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, [even] to him who is raised from the dead...But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held."
- Context: Paul then identifies the law as 10th commandment in v.7 ("Thou shalt not covet")
- Key: "Dead to the law" = relationship to law changed, not law abolished. The law remains "holy, just, good, spiritual" (vv.12,14)

**Hebrews 7:11-19** -- Priesthood change requiring law change
- v.16: entole sarkines (commandment with qualifier "carnal/fleshly") = Levitical succession law
- v.18: "disannulling of the commandment going before" = same Levitical succession commandment
- Key: The entole that is disannulled has the qualifier sarkines and refers specifically to priesthood succession, NOT the Decalogue

**Galatians 3:13,19,24-25** -- "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law...Wherefore then [serveth] the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come...the law was our schoolmaster."
- Greek: ho nomos (articular throughout)
- Key counter-example: Articular nomos for what was "added" and served a temporary pedagogical function
- Note: This challenges a rigid article = moral rule, but Galatians may refer to the entire Mosaic regulatory system

**Matthew 5:17-19** -- "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments..."
- Greek: ton nomon (articular), entole (commandments)
- Content: Jesus affirms the law and commandments as continuing
- Key: Strongest affirmation passage; uses both nomos and entole for what continues

**Luke 16:17** -- "And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."
- Greek: tou nomou (articular genitive)
- Content: The law's permanence affirmed

## VIII. Additional Context Passages

**Acts 15:28-29** -- "For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication."
- Context for Acts 16:4 (dogma): The Jerusalem Council "decrees" concerned dietary/purity matters for Gentile converts

**1 Timothy 1:5,8-10** -- "Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart...But we know that the law [is] good, if a man use it lawfully; Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners..."
- Note: v.5 uses entole (G1785 -- but check: this may be parangelia [G3852](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3852/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} not entole); v.8 uses nomos
- The vice list in vv.9-10 maps to Decalogue violations: murderers of fathers/mothers (5th), manslayers (6th), whoremongers (7th), menstealers (8th), liars/perjured (9th)

**Titus 1:14** -- "Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth."
- Greek: entolais anthropon ("commandments of men")
- Key: Entole WITH qualifier "of men" = human religious regulations (negative context)

**Matthew 15:9 / Mark 7:7** -- "But in vain they do worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men."
- Greek: entalma (G1778), NOT entole (G1785) -- different word
- But [G1778](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1778/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} is cognate of [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; the "commandments of men" concept uses a related term

**Colossians 2:22** -- "Which all are to perish with the using; after the commandments and doctrines of men?"
- Greek: entalma (G1778) and didaskalia (G1319) -- again, the related word entalma for human precepts
