# What Are the Ceremonial/Ritual Laws and How Do They Differ from the Moral Law?

## Question
What are the ceremonial/ritual laws and how do they differ from the moral law? Investigate the five categories: sacrifices (Lev 1-7), feasts (Lev 23:4-36), purity regulations (Lev 11-15), sanctuary service (Exo 25-30), and circumcision (Gen 17, Acts 15, Gal 5:2-6). Examine their typological/forward-pointing purpose (Heb 10:1, Col 2:17), their origin through Moses as mediator (not God's direct voice), their medium (book, not stone), their repository (beside the Ark, not inside), and every contrast with the Decalogue established in prior studies.

## Summary Answer
The Bible identifies five categories of ceremonial/ritual law -- sacrifices (Lev 1-7), feasts (Lev 23:4-36), purity regulations (Lev 11-15), sanctuary service (Exo 25-30), and circumcision (Gen 17; Acts 15; Gal 5) -- and consistently distinguishes them from the Decalogue across multiple dimensions. These ceremonial laws were delivered through Moses as mediator (Lev 1:1; 26:46; Gal 3:19), written by Moses in a book (Deu 31:9, 24), placed beside the Ark (Deu 31:26), described as "a shadow of good things to come" (Heb 10:1; Col 2:17), called "carnal ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation" (Heb 9:10), and characterized as what was "nailed to his cross" using the vocabulary of dogma (G1378) and cheirographon (G5498) -- words never applied to the moral law. The Decalogue, by contrast, was spoken by God's own voice (Exo 20:1; Deu 5:22), written by God's finger (Exo 31:18), placed inside the Ark (Exo 25:16; Deu 10:5), called "holy, just, good, spiritual" (Rom 7:12, 14), and is written on hearts in the new covenant (Heb 8:10; 10:16). Paul states in a single verse: "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God" (1 Cor 7:19).

## Key Verses

**Hebrews 10:1** -- "For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect."

**Colossians 2:14, 17** -- "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us...nailing it to his cross... Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ."

**Hebrews 9:10** -- "Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation."

**1 Corinthians 7:19** -- "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."

**Leviticus 23:37-38** -- "These are the feasts of the LORD... Beside the sabbaths of the LORD."

**Deuteronomy 31:26** -- "Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark... that it may be there for a witness against thee."

**Galatians 3:19** -- "Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come... in the hand of a mediator."

**Hebrews 7:12** -- "For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law."

**Acts 15:10** -- "Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Position | Tree 3 Trace | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | The sacrificial law was delivered through Moses: "The LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation." The delivery formula is mediated, not direct to the people. | Lev 1:1 | Continues | The Continues position argues the Bible distinguishes between moral and ceremonial/civil law categories, while the Abolished position denies any such distinction. Evidence of a different delivery mode for sacrificial law supports the distinction, thus supports Continues. | E121 (new) |
| E2 | God declared sacrifice was not His ultimate desire: "Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire...burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required." The Messiah delights in God's law (towrah) within his heart. | Psa 40:6-8 | Neutral | V1: "Thy law is within my heart" could be continuation vocabulary. But the verse is a Messianic prophecy about God's law vs. sacrifice, and both sides accept this contrast. V2: No. -> Neutral. (Factual observation: the text contrasts sacrifices with God's law in the heart.) | E122 (new) |
| E3 | "To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." Obedience to God's voice ranks above the sacrificial system. | 1Sa 15:22 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: obedience > sacrifice.) | E123 (new) |
| E4 | "I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings." God places moral duty above ceremonial observance. | Hos 6:6 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: mercy > sacrifice.) | E124 (new) |
| E5 | "What doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" -- stated after exhausting all sacrificial options. | Mic 6:8 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: moral requirements trump ceremonial.) | E125 (new) |
| E6 | The weekly Sabbath is listed separately from the annual feasts in Lev 23: the Sabbath in v.3, then "these are the feasts of the LORD" begins in v.4. | Lev 23:3-4 | Continues | The Continues position argues the Bible distinguishes between moral and ceremonial/civil law categories, while the Abolished position denies any such distinction. The structural separation of the weekly Sabbath from the feasts supports a sabbath-type distinction, thus supports Continues. | E126 (new) |
| E7 | The annual feasts are described as "beside the sabbaths of the LORD." The Hebrew milled (beside/apart from) places feast sabbaths in a separate category from weekly Sabbaths. | Lev 23:37-38 | Continues | The Continues position argues the Bible distinguishes between moral and ceremonial/civil law categories, while the Abolished position denies any such distinction. The explicit separation statement ("beside the sabbaths of the LORD") supports the distinction, thus supports Continues. | E127 (new) |
| E8 | "Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD." The feasts came through Moses' declaration -- mediated delivery. | Lev 23:44 | Continues | The Continues position argues the Bible distinguishes between moral and ceremonial/civil law categories, while the Abolished position denies any such distinction. Evidence of mediated delivery for feasts supports the distinction, thus supports Continues. | E128 (new) |
| E9 | Luke attributes the purification law to "the law of Moses": "When the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished." | Luk 2:22 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: NT author attributes purification regulations to the law of Moses.) | E129 (new) |
| E10 | The tabernacle was built after a "pattern" shown to Moses: "According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle." The earthly sanctuary was a copy of a heavenly original. | Exo 25:9, 40 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: the tabernacle is a copy.) | E130 (new) |
| E11 | Stephen uses typos (G5179) for the tabernacle: Moses was to "make it according to the fashion [typos] that he had seen." | Acts 7:44 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: NT uses "type/pattern" for the tabernacle.) | E131 (new) |
| E12 | "The law having a shadow [skia] of good things to come...can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect." The referent is "those sacrifices" -- the annual sacrificial system. | Heb 10:1 | Neutral | V2: "Shadow" is cessation vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: The subject is identified by the verse itself: "those sacrifices which they offered year by year." The referent is the sacrificial system, not the moral law. Both sides agree the sacrificial system is a shadow. -> Step 3: RC2 -- "The annual sacrificial system is called a shadow that cannot make perfect." RC3 -- Both sides agree. -> Neutral. | E056 (exists -- "Also In" update) |
| E13 | "It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins." The animal sacrificial system is explicitly declared insufficient for sin removal. | Heb 10:4 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation about sacrificial insufficiency. Both sides agree.) | E132 (new) |
| E14 | "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second." In context, "the first" = repeated sacrifices; "the second" = Christ's offering. | Heb 10:9 | Neutral | V2: "Taketh away" is cessation vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: "The first" is identified by context (vv.5-8) as "sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin...which are offered by the law." The referent is the sacrificial system. Both sides agree. -> Neutral. | E133 (new) |
| E15 | "By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified." Christ's single sacrifice accomplishes what the repeated animal sacrifices could not. | Heb 10:14 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: Christ's one offering perfects.) | E134 (new) |
| E16 | "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances [cheirographon tois dogmasin] that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross." Uses dogma (G1378) and cheirographon (G5498). | Col 2:14 | Neutral | -> Master E054 (exists, classified Neutral in law-01 -- both sides agree dogma was nailed to the cross; the disagreement is about what dogma encompasses). | E054 (exists -- "Also In" update) |
| E17 | "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ." | Col 2:16-17 | Neutral | -> Master E055 (exists, classified Neutral -- the referent of "sabbath days" is ambiguous between weekly and annual sabbaths). | E055 (exists -- "Also In" update) |
| E18 | "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances [en dogmasin]." Uses dogma (G1378). | Eph 2:15 | Neutral | -> Master E053 (exists, classified Neutral -- dogma identifies the referent as ceremonial ordinances). | E053 (exists -- "Also In" update) |
| E19 | The tabernacle was "a figure [parabole] for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience." | Heb 9:9 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: "Figure for the time then present" implies temporality. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: The referent is the tabernacle service (v.6-8: priestly service in the first tabernacle). Ceremonial, not moral. Both sides agree. -> Neutral. | E135 (new) |
| E20 | "Carnal ordinances [dikaiomata sarkos], imposed on them until the time of reformation [diorthosis]." Explicit temporal limitation on the ceremonial system. | Heb 9:10 | Neutral | V2: "Carnal ordinances," "imposed until" -- cessation vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: The referent is identified by context: "meats and drinks, and divers washings" -- ceremonial items. Both sides agree these are ceremonial. -> Neutral. | E136 (new) |
| E21 | The earthly priests "serve unto the example and shadow [skia] of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle." | Heb 8:5 | Neutral | V2: "Shadow" is cessation vocabulary. Gate 1: Referent is the tabernacle service. Both sides agree. -> Neutral. | E137 (new) |
| E22 | "The heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures [antitypa] of the true; but into heaven itself." | Heb 9:23-24 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: earthly sanctuary = figure/antitype; heaven = the true.) | E138 (new) |
| E23 | "For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us." Paul identifies Christ as the antitype of the Passover lamb. | 1Co 5:7 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: Christ fulfills the Passover type.) | E139 (new) |
| E24 | "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world." John the Baptist identifies Jesus with the sacrificial lamb imagery. | Jhn 1:29 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: Jesus identified as the Lamb.) | E140 (new) |
| E25 | "He shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease." Daniel prophesies the end of the sacrificial system. | Dan 9:27 | Neutral | V2: "Cause to cease" is cessation vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: The referent is "sacrifice and oblation" -- the sacrificial system. Both sides agree. -> Neutral. | E141 (new) |
| E26 | "The veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom" at the moment of Jesus' death. Three Synoptic Gospels record this. | Mat 27:51; Mrk 15:38; Luk 23:45 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: the temple veil tore at Jesus' death.) | E142 (new) |
| E27 | "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God." Paul dismisses a ceremonial rite while affirming the moral commandments (entole tou theou). | 1Co 7:19 | Continues | V1: YES -- "keeping of the commandments of God" uses entole (G1785), the standard NT word for moral commandments; affirms ongoing commandment-keeping. -> Candidate CONTINUES. Gate 1: PASS -- "the commandments of God" is contrasted with "circumcision" (a specific ceremonial rite). The referent of "commandments" is moral (distinguished from circumcision in the same sentence). Gate 2: PASS -- declarative statement. Gate 3: PASS -- didactic epistle. Gate 4: No conflict with other E-items. PASS. -> CONTINUES. | E143 (new) |
| E28 | "If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing...neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love." | Gal 5:2, 6 | Neutral | V1: No explicit continuation vocabulary for the moral law. V2: No explicit cessation vocabulary for the moral law (circumcision ceasing is not the moral law ceasing). Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: circumcision avails nothing; faith working by love is what matters.) | E144 (new) |
| E29 | Peter calls the requirement to circumcise and keep the law of Moses "a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear." | Acts 15:10 | Neutral | V2: "Yoke" is cessation-related vocabulary ("yoke of bondage" -- Gal 5:1). -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: The referent is "circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses" (v.5) -- the ceremonial system as a soteriological requirement. Both sides agree the Judaizers' demand was wrong. -> Neutral. | E145 (new) |
| E30 | The apostolic council, with the Holy Spirit (v.28), determined that Gentile believers need not be circumcised or "keep the law of Moses" (as demanded by the Judaizers). Required only: abstain from idols, fornication, things strangled, blood. | Acts 15:28-29 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: apostolic decision about ceremonial requirements for Gentiles.) | E146 (new) |
| E31 | "He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised." Circumcision was a sign/seal of pre-existing faith-righteousness. | Rom 4:11 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: circumcision was a sign/seal, not the source of righteousness.) | E147 (new) |
| E32 | "He is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart." | Rom 2:28-29 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: Paul distinguishes physical from spiritual circumcision.) | E148 (new) |
| E33 | "Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart." Even in the OT (Deuteronomy), Moses calls for spiritual rather than merely physical circumcision. | Deu 10:16 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: spiritual circumcision called for in the OT.) | E149 (new) |
| E34 | "Ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ." The NT spiritual reality replaces the physical ceremony. | Col 2:11 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: NT describes a spiritual circumcision.) | E150 (new) |
| E35 | "The priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law." The law that changes is the law governing the priesthood. | Heb 7:12 | Neutral | V2: "Changed" is cessation vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: "The law" -- which law? Context (v.11): "the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law)." The law in view is the law governing the Levitical priesthood -- the ceremonial law of priestly succession and sacrifice. Both sides agree the Levitical priesthood has been superseded by Christ's Melchizedek priesthood. -> Neutral. | E151 (new) |
| E36 | "Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life." Christ's priesthood is contrasted with the "carnal commandment" of Levitical succession. | Heb 7:16 | Neutral | V2: "Carnal commandment" = cessation vocabulary. Gate 1: The referent is "the law of a carnal commandment" -- the Levitical succession law. "Carnal" (sarkinos) identifies this as ceremonial, not moral. Both sides agree. -> Neutral. | E152 (new) |
| E37 | "There is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. For the law made nothing perfect." | Heb 7:18-19 | Neutral | V2: "Disannulling," "weakness," "unprofitableness" = cessation vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: "The commandment going before" -- context identifies this as the Levitical priesthood law (v.11-17). "Weakness and unprofitableness" contrasts with the moral law's characterization as "perfect" (Psa 19:7) and "holy, just, good, spiritual" (Rom 7:12, 14). Both sides agree the Levitical priesthood law has been set aside. -> Neutral. | E153 (new) |
| E38 | "Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin." Since sins are forgiven through Christ, the sacrificial system has no further purpose. | Heb 10:18 | Neutral | V2: "No more offering" is cessation vocabulary applied to the sacrificial system. Gate 1: Referent is "offering for sin" -- the sacrificial system. Both sides agree. -> Neutral. | E154 (new) |
| E39 | "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them." In the new covenant, God's laws are internalized. | Heb 10:16 | Continues | V1: YES -- "put my laws into their hearts...write them" = "write on hearts" vocabulary, law continuation. -> Master E039 (exists, classified Continues). | E039 (exists -- "Also In" update) |
| E40 | "In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away." The covenant arrangement changes; the law is written on hearts (v.10). | Heb 8:13 | Neutral | -> Master E057 (exists, classified Neutral -- the old covenant arrangement vanishes; the law is internalized). | E057 (exists -- "Also In" update) |
| E41 | The Levitical closing: "These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses." | Lev 26:46 | Neutral | -> Master E108 (exists, classified Neutral). | E108 (exists -- "Also In" update) |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | All five categories of ceremonial law (sacrifices, feasts, purity, sanctuary, circumcision) were delivered through Moses as mediator, not by God's direct voice to the people. The delivery formula "the LORD spake unto Moses" is used for all of them. | E1 (Lev 1:1), E8 (Lev 23:44), E9 (Luk 2:22), E10 (Exo 25:1-2), E41/E108 (Lev 26:46); cf. E001, E002 (Decalogue spoken directly) | Continues | The mediated delivery formula is observable in the text for each category. The Decalogue's direct delivery is also observable. No reader can deny the contrast in delivery mode. | Gate 0: N-Test 1: YES -- both positions acknowledge the mediated delivery of ceremonial law. N-Test 2: YES. N-Test 3: YES. PASS. -> Reclassified Continues: The Continues position argues the Bible distinguishes between moral and ceremonial/civil law categories, while the Abolished position denies any such distinction. Evidence that all ceremonial law was mediated through Moses (contrasting with the Decalogue's direct delivery) supports the distinction, thus supports Continues. | N016 (new) |
| N2 | The NT uses shadow/type/figure vocabulary (skia, typos, parabole, hypodeigma, antitypos) exclusively for the ceremonial system (sacrifices, tabernacle, feasts), never for the moral law/Decalogue. | E12/E056 (Heb 10:1), E17/E055 (Col 2:17), E21/E137 (Heb 8:5), E19/E135 (Heb 9:9), E22/E138 (Heb 9:23-24), E11/E131 (Acts 7:44); word study on skia (G4639) and typos (G5179) | Continues | The shadow/type vocabulary is applied to specific ceremonial items in each passage. No passage applies this vocabulary to the moral law/Decalogue. This is an observable lexical distribution. Both sides acknowledge these words are used for the ceremonial system. | Gate 0: N-Test 1: YES -- both positions acknowledge the shadow/type vocabulary distribution. N-Test 2: YES. N-Test 3: YES. PASS. -> Reclassified Continues: The Continues position argues the Bible distinguishes between moral and ceremonial/civil law categories, while the Abolished position denies any such distinction. The exclusive application of shadow/type vocabulary to the ceremonial system (never to the Decalogue) supports the distinction, thus supports Continues. | N017 (new) |
| N3 | The NT cessation vocabulary (dogma, cheirographon, dikaiomata sarkos) is never used for the moral law/Decalogue. Dogma (G1378) appears 5 times in the NT and never refers to the Decalogue. Cheirographon (G5498) means "hand-written" -- the Decalogue was written by God's finger. | E16/E054, E18/E053 (dogma), word study on dogma (G1378) and cheirographon (G5498); cf. E003 (Exo 31:18 -- finger of God) | Continues | The vocabulary distribution is an observable lexical fact. Both sides acknowledge dogma is the word used in the cessation passages and that cheirographon means "hand-written." | Gate 0: N-Test 1: YES -- both positions can verify the vocabulary distribution. N-Test 2: YES. N-Test 3: YES. PASS. -> Reclassified Continues: The Continues position argues the Bible distinguishes between moral and ceremonial/civil law categories, while the Abolished position denies any such distinction. The fact that cessation vocabulary is never used for the Decalogue supports the distinction, thus supports Continues. | N018 (new) |
| N4 | Paul simultaneously dismisses circumcision (a ceremonial rite) as "nothing" while affirming "the keeping of the commandments of God" (entole) in the same verse (1 Cor 7:19). The text contains both a ceremonial dismissal and a moral affirmation in one statement. | E27/E143 (1Co 7:19) | Continues | E27 directly quotes the verse. The verse contains both "circumcision is nothing" and "but the keeping of the commandments of God." Both clauses are in the same sentence. Both sides acknowledge this is what Paul wrote. | Gate 0: N-Test 1: YES -- both sides accept this is what the verse says. N-Test 2: YES, this is the only reading. N-Test 3: YES. PASS. -> Reclassified Continues: The Continues position argues the Bible distinguishes between moral and ceremonial/civil law categories, while the Abolished position denies any such distinction. Paul dismissing circumcision while affirming commandments in the same verse supports the distinction, thus supports Continues. | N019 (new) |
| N5 | The Bible ascribes opposite characterizations to the ceremonial and moral law: the ceremonial system is called "carnal ordinances" (Heb 9:10), "weak and unprofitable" (Heb 7:18), "a witness against thee" (Deu 31:26), unable to "make perfect" (Heb 10:1); the moral law is called "holy, just, good" (Rom 7:12), "spiritual" (Rom 7:14), "perfect" (Psa 19:7), standing "for ever and ever" (Psa 111:7-8). | E20/E136, E37/E153, E44/E009, E12/E056; cf. E010 (Rom 7:12), E011 (Rom 7:14), E012 (Psa 19:7), E014 (Psa 111:7-8) | Continues | Each characterization is individually observable in the cited verses. The observation that these form contrasting patterns is an observable lexical distribution. Both sides acknowledge the individual characterizations. | Gate 0: N-Test 1: Would both sides agree these contrasting characterizations exist in the text? YES -- both sides acknowledge the Bible calls the sacrificial system "carnal" and the moral law "spiritual." N-Test 2: YES. N-Test 3: YES (the contrast is in the text, not added). PASS. -> Reclassified Continues: The Continues position argues the Bible distinguishes between moral and ceremonial/civil law categories, while the Abolished position denies any such distinction. Opposite characterizations (carnal vs. spiritual, weak vs. perfect, temporary vs. eternal) support the distinction, thus support Continues. | N020 (new) |
| N6 | Leviticus 23:37-38 explicitly places the annual feast sabbaths "beside the sabbaths of the LORD." The text itself draws a distinction between feast-day sabbaths and weekly sabbaths. | E7/E127 (Lev 23:37-38) | Continues | The text states the feast days are "beside" (milled) the weekly sabbaths. This is what the verse says. No reader can deny the text makes this distinction. | Gate 0: N-Test 1: YES -- both positions can verify the Hebrew text. N-Test 2: YES. N-Test 3: YES. PASS. -> Reclassified Continues: The Continues position argues the Bible distinguishes between moral and ceremonial/civil law categories, while the Abolished position denies any such distinction. The explicit separation of feast sabbaths from weekly sabbaths supports the distinction, thus supports Continues. | N021 (new) |

Word study: cheirographon = cheir (hand) + grapho (write). | Each component is in the E/N tables: the cheirographon is "hand-written" (E/word study), the Decalogue was written by God's finger (E), Moses wrote the book of the law by hand (E). The claim combines these into the identification that cheirographon = Moses' book. The lexical connection (cheir = hand; etsba Elohim = finger of God) is derived from the text's own vocabulary. | #5 (systematizing); #4a (SIS: the meaning of cheirographon is determined by its etymology and the established fact that the Decalogue was not hand-written) | I022 (new) |

The listing "holyday, new moon, sabbath days" follows a sequence (annual, monthly, weekly) that could include the weekly Sabbath. | The text of Col 2:16 uses "sabbaton" without specifying which sabbaths. Assigning it to ceremonial sabbaths only requires importing the Lev 23:37-38 distinction. Assigning it to the weekly Sabbath requires ignoring the context of ceremonial items. Both readings require interpretive judgment beyond what Col 2:16 alone specifies. | #2 (choosing between readings of which sabbaths are meant); #4b (cross-referencing Lev 23:37-38 to identify the referent) | I023 (new) |
| I4 | The Bible teaches that the entire Sinai legislation (including the Decalogue and Sabbath) was a temporary system fulfilled in Christ and replaced by the "law of Christ" or "new covenant law."

I019 from law-03 (Sabbath's Decalogue placement). | Each component is in the E/N tables. The claim systematizes the Lev 23:37-38 distinction with the Decalogue's unique features to conclude that the weekly Sabbath is distinct from ceremonial sabbaths. This is a step of systematization beyond any single verse. | #5 (systematizing multiple E/N items) | I025 (new) |
| I6 | The word olam ("everlasting") when applied to ceremonial institutions (circumcision, Day of Atonement) means "for the duration of the dispensation" rather than "absolute infinity," since the NT explicitly abolishes circumcision (Acts 15; Gal 5) and declares the ceremonial system temporary (Heb 9:10). | I-B | FOR: E29/E145 (Acts 15:10: circumcision called a yoke). E28/E144 (Gal 5:2, 6: circumcision avails nothing). E20/E136 (Heb 9:10: "imposed until the time of reformation"). These passages explicitly limit ceremonies that Gen 17:13 and Lev 16:34 call olam. AGAINST: Gen 17:13 ("everlasting covenant") and Lev 16:34 ("everlasting statute") use olam, which elsewhere describes things that truly endure (Psa 111:7-8 for commandments). If olam means "everlasting" for the commandments, it should mean "everlasting" for circumcision too. | The claim requires determining olam's semantic range in ceremonial contexts. The NT data (circumcision abolished, ordinances "imposed until") provides clear evidence that olam for ceremonies has a limited sense. But the same word is used for the commandments' permanence. The resolution depends on which passages govern the reading. | #2 (choosing between readings of olam's range); #4a (SIS: NT explicit abolition of circumcision determines reading of olam in Gen 17:13) | I026 (new) |

### I-B Resolution: I3 -- "Sabbath Days" in Col 2:16-17 Refers to Ceremonial Sabbaths

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (ceremonial sabbaths only): E127 (Lev 23:37-38: feast sabbaths "beside the sabbaths of the LORD"), N021 (textual distinction), N017 (shadow vocabulary applied exclusively to ceremonial system), E086 (weekly Sabbath grounded in creation within Decalogue), N001-N002 (two delivery modes, two repositories), I019 (Sabbath Decalogue placement).
- AGAINST (includes weekly Sabbath): E055 (Col 2:16: "sabbaton" unspecified), the annual-monthly-weekly sequence (holyday, new moon, sabbath days) could include the weekly Sabbath, E055 is classified Neutral because the referent is ambiguous.

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E127 | Plain | Lev 23:37-38 explicitly states feast days are "beside the sabbaths of the LORD." |
| N021 | Plain | Observable textual distinction in the Hebrew. |
| N017 | Plain | Observable vocabulary distribution -- shadow vocabulary applied to ceremonial items. |
| E086 | Plain | The fourth commandment is within the Decalogue, grounded in creation (Exo 20:8-11). |
| N001 | Plain | Two delivery modes are documented in the text. |
| N002 | Plain | Two repositories are documented in the text. |
| E055 | Ambiguous | Col 2:16 uses "sabbaton" without specifying which sabbaths. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR side: Multiple Plain items (E127, N021, N017, E086, N001, N002).
AGAINST side: One Ambiguous item (E055).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements determine the reading of the Ambiguous one. Lev 23:37-38 (Plain) explicitly distinguishes feast sabbaths from "the sabbaths of the LORD." The shadow vocabulary (Plain, N017) is applied to the ceremonial system. The Sabbath's placement within the Decalogue (Plain, E086) places it in the directly-spoken, God-written, inside-the-ark category. Col 2:16 (Ambiguous) uses "sabbaton" in a list of ceremonial items (meat, drink, holyday, new moon). The Plain evidence governs the Ambiguous passage: the "sabbath days" in the ceremonial list are most consistently read as the ceremonial sabbaths that are "beside" the weekly Sabbath.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate**
Plain statements on the FOR side dominate. The AGAINST side has only one Ambiguous passage. The resolution is Moderate rather than Strong because the word sabbaton in Col 2:16 can linguistically include the weekly Sabbath, and the annual-monthly-weekly reading of the list has a textual basis. *(Examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Col 2:16-17.)*

---

### I-B Resolution: I6 -- Olam for Ceremonial Institutions Means "For the Dispensation"

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (limited sense): E145 (Acts 15:10: circumcision = yoke), E144 (Gal 5:2, 6: circumcision avails nothing), E136 (Heb 9:10: "imposed until the time of reformation"). The NT explicitly limits ceremonies that the OT calls olam.
- AGAINST (absolute sense): Gen 17:13 and Lev 16:34 use olam. Psa 111:7-8 uses olam for the commandments' permanence. If olam is absolute in Psa 111, it should be absolute in Gen 17.

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E145 | Plain | Direct statement by Peter: circumcision is a yoke. |
| E144 | Plain | Direct statement by Paul: circumcision avails nothing. |
| E136 | Plain | "Carnal ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation." Explicitly temporal. |
| Gen 17:13 | Contextually Clear | Uses olam, but the subject (circumcision) is explicitly declared abolished in the NT. |
| Lev 16:34 | Contextually Clear | Uses olam, but the ceremonial ordinances are explicitly called "imposed until." |
| Psa 111:7-8 | Plain | "Stand fast for ever and ever" applied to commandments. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: Three Plain NT statements explicitly limiting the duration of olam-designated ceremonies.
AGAINST: Two Contextually Clear OT passages using olam for ceremonies, plus one Plain OT passage using olam for commandments (Psa 111:7-8). The Psa 111 passage applies olam to commandments, not ceremonies -- it does not support olam meaning "absolute eternity" for ceremonies; it only shows olam can mean that for commandments.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The NT Plain statements (Acts 15:10; Gal 5:2, 6; Heb 9:10) explicitly and unambiguously limit the duration of circumcision and the ceremonial ordinances. These clear NT passages determine the reading of olam in Gen 17:13 and Lev 16:34: olam, when applied to ceremonies, functions as "for the appointed duration" rather than "absolute infinity." This is standard SIS: the clearer (NT explicit abolition) interprets the less clear (OT olam with broad semantic range).

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
The NT Plain evidence explicitly abolishes what the OT calls olam. The AGAINST side's evidence (Contextually Clear) cannot override the explicit NT statements. Olam in ceremonial contexts means "for the duration of the dispensation."

### Positional Classification Summary

**E-items:**
- **Continues:** E1/E121 (Lev 1:1: sacrificial law delivered through Moses -- different delivery mode), E6/E126 (Lev 23:3-4: weekly Sabbath listed separately from feasts), E7/E127 (Lev 23:37-38: feast sabbaths "beside the sabbaths of the LORD"), E8/E128 (Lev 23:44: feasts declared by Moses -- mediated delivery), E27/E143 (1 Cor 7:19: commandments of God vs. circumcision), E39/E039 (Heb 10:16: laws written on hearts) = 6 items (5 new, 1 existing)
- **Abolished:** 0 items (all cessation-vocabulary E-items were reclassified to Neutral through Gate 1 because the referent was identified as the ceremonial system)
- **Neutral:** All remaining = 39 items

**N-items:**
- **Continues:** N1/N016 (all ceremonial law mediated through Moses), N2/N017 (shadow/type vocabulary exclusively ceremonial), N3/N018 (cessation vocabulary never used for Decalogue), N4/N019 (Paul dismisses circumcision but affirms commandments), N5/N020 (opposite characterizations: carnal vs. spiritual, weak vs. perfect, temporary vs. eternal), N6/N021 (Lev 23:37-38 explicitly separates feast sabbaths from weekly sabbaths) = 6 items (all new)
- **Abolished:** 0
- **Neutral:** 0

**I-items:**
- **I-A Continues:** I1/I021 (ceremonial abolished, moral continues), I2/I022 (cheirographon = Moses' book), I5/I025 (Lev 23 Sabbath distinction) = 3 items
- **I-B (both sides):** I3/I023 (Col 2:16 sabbaths -- resolved Moderate toward Continues), I6/I026 (olam for ceremonies -- resolved Strong toward Continues) = 2 items
- **I-C Neutral:** 0
- **I-D Abolished:** I4/I024 (entire law abolished) = 1 item

---

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases actual verse text. Checked.
- Each is the plain meaning of the words in the verse. Checked.
- E-items report what the text SAYS, not what a position infers. Checked.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- E27/E143 (Continues): "Keeping of the commandments of God" is continuation vocabulary (entole tou theou). Subject: moral commandments (distinguished from circumcision). Grammar: declarative. Genre: didactic epistle. Harmony: consistent with E010, E011, E030, E031, E032. All four gates pass. Verified.
- E39/E039 (Continues): "Put my laws into their hearts" -- continuation vocabulary. Previously verified in law-01. Verified.
- E1/E121, E6/E126, E7/E127, E8/E128 (Continues): These items document delivery mode distinctions (E1, E8) and sabbath-type distinctions (E6, E7) that support the moral/ceremonial law distinction. The Continues position argues the Bible distinguishes these categories; the Abolished position denies any such distinction. Evidence of distinction supports Continues. Verified.
- All cessation-vocabulary E-items (E12, E14, E17, E18, E19, E20, E21, E25, E29, E35, E36, E37, E38, E40) were classified Neutral because Gate 1 identified the referent as the ceremonial system (sacrifices, ordinances, priesthood), not the moral law. Both sides agree the ceremonial system has been fulfilled. Verified.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- N016 (Continues): All ceremonial law delivered through Moses -- observable from the delivery formulas. Evidence of distinction supports Continues. Verified.
- N017 (Continues): Shadow/type vocabulary exclusively ceremonial -- observable vocabulary distribution. Evidence of distinction supports Continues. Verified.
- N018 (Continues): Cessation vocabulary never used for moral law -- observable. Evidence of distinction supports Continues. Verified.
- N019 (Continues): Paul contrasts circumcision with commandments in one verse -- observable. Evidence of distinction supports Continues. Verified.
- N020 (Continues): Contrasting characterizations -- observable in the cited verses. Evidence of distinction supports Continues. Verified.
- N021 (Continues): Lev 23:37-38 distinction -- stated in the text. Evidence of distinction supports Continues. Verified.
- All pass the three N-tier tests (universal agreement, no interpretation required, zero added concepts). Verified.
- All reclassified Continues because: the Continues position argues the Bible distinguishes between moral and ceremonial/civil law categories, while the Abolished position denies any such distinction. Evidence of a distinction supports Continues.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
- I1/I021 (I-A): All components (E/N items) in the E/N tables. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A.
- I2/I022 (I-A): Components (E054, E003, E009, N018, word study) in E/N tables. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A.
- I3/I023 (I-B): Both sides have E/N items. Confirmed I-B.
- I4/I024 (I-D): Requires "entire law is one unit" -- a concept not found in the E/N tables (1 Cor 7:19 distinguishes two categories). External framework. Overrides E143, E010-E011, E021, E025, E039, E031-E033. Confirmed I-D.
- I5/I025 (I-A): Components (E127, N021, E086, N001, N002) all in E/N tables. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A.
- I6/I026 (I-B): Both sides have E/N items (NT abolition evidence vs. OT olam usage). Confirmed I-B.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
- I1/I021: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I2/I022: Does not require E/N reinterpretation. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I3/I023: Requires choosing which sabbaths Col 2:16 means. Confirmed conflicts on one reading (I-B).
- I4/I024: Requires E143 to not mean what it says (Paul distinguishes ceremonial from moral). Requires overriding E010-E011, E021, E025, E039. Confirmed conflicts (I-D).
- I5/I025: Does not require E/N reinterpretation. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I6/I026: Requires determining olam's sense in ceremonial contexts. Confirmed conflicts with at least one reading (I-B).

**Step E: Run consistency checks.**
- I1/I021 (I-A): Requires #5 only. Confirmed.
- I2/I022 (I-A): Requires #5 + #4a. The SIS connection (cheirographon = hand-written; Decalogue = God-written) is verified by the words' own etymologies and the explicit text of Exo 31:18. Confirmed.
- I3/I023 (I-B): E/N items on both sides. Confirmed.
- I4/I024 (I-D): Overrides E143, E010-E011, E021, E025, E039, E031-E033. Confirmed.
- I5/I025 (I-A): Requires #5 only. Confirmed.
- I6/I026 (I-B): E/N items on both sides. Confirmed.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- I2/I022: The connection between cheirographon (hand-written) and Exo 31:18 (finger of God) is through shared vocabulary domain (writing/authorship). The texts address the same question: who wrote the document in question? Verified.
- I3/I023: Full I-B resolution documented above. Confirmed.
- I6/I026: Full I-B resolution documented above. Confirmed.

### What CAN Be Said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies)

1. All five categories of ceremonial law (sacrifices, feasts, purity regulations, sanctuary service, circumcision) were delivered through Moses as mediator, not by God's direct voice (E121, E128, E129, E130, E108; N016).
2. The NT uses shadow/type/figure vocabulary (skia, typos, parabole, hypodeigma, antitypos) exclusively for the ceremonial system, never for the moral law/Decalogue (N017).
3. The NT cessation vocabulary (dogma, cheirographon, dikaiomata sarkos) is never applied to the moral law/Decalogue (N018).
4. The ceremonial system is called "carnal ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation" (E136/Heb 9:10) -- explicit temporal limitation.
5. The animal sacrificial system "can never...make the comers thereunto perfect" and "it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins" (E056/Heb 10:1; E132/Heb 10:4).
6. Christ's one offering replaces the repeated sacrifices: "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second" (E133/Heb 10:9).
7. Christ is explicitly identified as the antitype of the Passover lamb (E139/1 Cor 5:7) and the sacrificial lamb (E140/Jhn 1:29).
8. Daniel prophesied the cessation of sacrifice and oblation (E141/Dan 9:27).
9. The temple veil was torn at Jesus' death (E142/Mat 27:51; Mrk 15:38; Luk 23:45).
10. The cheirographon (hand-written document) was nailed to the cross (E054/Col 2:14). Cheirographon means "hand-written"; the Decalogue was written by God's finger (E003/Exo 31:18).
11. Paul states: "Circumcision is nothing...but the keeping of the commandments of God" (E143/1 Cor 7:19) -- distinguishing ceremonial from moral in a single verse.
12. The apostolic council determined circumcision and the "law of Moses" (as required by Judaizers) are not binding on Gentile believers (E145-E146/Acts 15:10, 28-29).
13. Leviticus 23:37-38 explicitly places the annual feast sabbaths "beside the sabbaths of the LORD" (E127; N021).
14. The book of the law was placed beside the ark "as a witness against thee" (E009/Deu 31:26); the Decalogue tablets were placed inside the ark (E007-E008).
15. The moral law is described as "holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal" while the ceremonial law is described as "carnal, weak, unprofitable, temporary, shadow" (N020).
16. In the new covenant, God's laws are written on hearts and minds (E039/Heb 10:16; 8:10).
17. The Levitical priesthood "being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law" -- the law governing the priesthood (E151/Heb 7:12).

### What CANNOT Be Said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture)

1. Scripture does not explicitly use the terms "moral law," "ceremonial law," or "civil law." These are theological categories that organize textual data the Bible itself presents (different delivery modes, different repositories, different vocabulary, different characterizations, different fates). The framework is compatible with the data but is not a biblical term (I008 from law-01).
2. Scripture does not explicitly state in one verse that the entire ceremonial system is abolished while the entire moral law continues. This comprehensive framework is a systematization of multiple passages (I021).
3. Scripture does not explicitly state whether the "sabbath days" in Colossians 2:16 refers to weekly or annual sabbaths. The text is unspecified on this point (E055, I023). *(Examined in depth in a later law-XX study.)*
4. Scripture does not explicitly reconcile the OT use of olam ("everlasting") for circumcision (Gen 17:13) and the Day of Atonement (Lev 16:34) with the NT abolition of these rites. The reconciliation (olam = "for the dispensation" in ceremonial contexts) is an inference supported by the NT evidence (I026).
5. Scripture does not explicitly state which specific "commandments of God" Paul affirms in 1 Corinthians 7:19 while dismissing circumcision. The Continues position reads entole as the Decalogue; the Abolished position may read it as new-covenant commands. The verse distinguishes ceremonial from "commandments of God" but does not enumerate them.
6. Neither position can claim the text explicitly states its complete systematic framework. The Continues position systematizes the textual distinctions into a two-category framework (I-A inferences). The Abolished position's claim that the entire law is one indivisible unit (I4/I024) requires overriding multiple E-items (E143, E010-E011, E021, E025, E039).

## Analysis

### The Five Categories of Ceremonial Law

**1. Sacrifices (Lev 1-7).** The entire sacrificial system -- burnt, grain, peace, sin, and trespass offerings -- was delivered through Moses (Lev 1:1). The OT prophets repeatedly placed obedience above sacrifice (1 Sa 15:22; Hos 6:6; Mic 6:6-8; Psa 40:6-8). The author of Hebrews declares these sacrifices a "shadow" that "can never...make perfect" (Heb 10:1) and states that animal blood "cannot take away sins" (Heb 10:4). Christ's single sacrifice replaces the entire system (Heb 10:9-14). Daniel prophesied the cessation of sacrifice (Dan 9:27).

**2. Feasts (Lev 23:4-36).** The annual feast calendar was given through Moses (Lev 23:44). Leviticus 23:37-38 explicitly states these feasts are "beside the sabbaths of the LORD" -- distinguishing them from the weekly Sabbath. The Passover is explicitly fulfilled in Christ (1 Cor 5:7). The feasts are listed among the "shadow of things to come" items (Col 2:16-17).

**3. Purity Regulations (Lev 11-15).** The dietary and bodily purity laws were given through Moses and Aaron (Lev 11:1-2). Luke attributes the purification laws to "the law of Moses" (Luk 2:22). The Hebrews author classifies "meats and drinks, and divers washings" as "carnal ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation" (Heb 9:10). Note: the clean/unclean animal distinction pre-dated the Levitical codification (Gen 7:2; N006 from law-02).

**4. Sanctuary Service (Exo 25-30).** The tabernacle was built after a heavenly "pattern" shown to Moses (Exo 25:9, 40). The NT calls this service a "shadow" (Heb 8:5), "figure" (Heb 9:9), and "patterns/figures of the true" (Heb 9:23-24). Christ ministers in the true tabernacle "which the Lord pitched, and not man" (Heb 8:2). The veil tearing at Jesus' death (Mat 27:51) signals the end of the barrier maintained by the ceremonial system.

**5. Circumcision (Gen 17; Acts 15; Gal 5).** Circumcision was a "sign" and "seal" of pre-existing faith (Rom 4:11) -- a ceremony pointing to a spiritual reality. The apostolic council determined it is not required for Gentile believers (Acts 15:28-29). Paul declares it "nothing" while affirming "the keeping of the commandments of God" (1 Cor 7:19). The spiritual reality (circumcision of the heart) continues (Rom 2:28-29; Col 2:11; Deu 10:16).

### The Typological Purpose

Every element of the ceremonial system pointed forward to a reality found in Christ. The sacrificial lamb pointed to Christ the Lamb of God (Jhn 1:29). The Passover pointed to Christ our Passover (1 Cor 5:7). The earthly sanctuary pointed to the heavenly sanctuary where Christ ministers (Heb 8:1-2; 9:24). The Levitical high priest pointed to Christ the eternal high priest (Heb 7:17). The purification ceremonies pointed to the cleansing blood of Christ (Heb 9:14). Circumcision of the flesh pointed to circumcision of the heart (Col 2:11). The text uses skia (shadow), typos (type/pattern), parabole (figure), hypodeigma (example), and antitypos (figure of the true) for these elements. None of these words is applied to the Decalogue.

### The Vocabulary Distinction

The NT consistently uses specific vocabulary for what was abolished:
- **dogma** (G1378): used in the two abolition passages (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14). Never used for the moral law.
- **cheirographon** (G5498): "hand-written" -- the Decalogue was written by God's finger, not by a human hand.
- **dikaiomata sarkos** (Heb 9:10): "carnal ordinances" -- the moral law is "spiritual" (Rom 7:14).

The NT uses different vocabulary for what continues:
- **entole** (G1785): commandments -- used for the moral law (1 Jn 5:3; Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14; 1 Cor 7:19).
- **nomos** qualified as "holy, just, good, spiritual" (Rom 7:12, 14), "the perfect law of liberty" (Jas 1:25), "the royal law" (Jas 2:8).

This vocabulary distribution is consistent across multiple NT authors (Paul, the author of Hebrews, John, James).

## Conclusion

Across 45 explicit statements, 6 necessary implications, and 6 inferences, this study's evidence distributes as follows: 6 explicit statements support Continues — 2 use law-continuation vocabulary (1 Cor 7:19 affirming the commandments of God; Heb 10:16 writing laws on hearts) and 4 evidence a categorical distinction between law types (mediated delivery mode for sacrificial law and feasts, weekly Sabbath listed separately from annual feasts, feast sabbaths "beside the sabbaths of the LORD"). Zero explicit statements use cessation vocabulary applied to the moral law/Decalogue. All cessation-vocabulary E-items (14 items) were reclassified to Neutral because Gate 1 identified the referent as the ceremonial system (sacrifices, ordinances, priesthood, tabernacle). Both positions agree the ceremonial system has been fulfilled in Christ.

39 E-items are Neutral — factual observations both sides must accept about the ceremonial system's characteristics, typological vocabulary, and NT treatment. 6 N-items support Continues — documenting the mediated delivery of all ceremonial law (N016), the shadow vocabulary distribution (N017), the cessation vocabulary distribution (N018), the 1 Cor 7:19 contrast (N019), the opposing characterizations (N020), and the Lev 23:37-38 distinction (N021). These support Continues because evidence of a distinction between moral and ceremonial/civil law categories supports the Continues position.

3 I-A inferences systematize the textual data toward the Continues position (ceremonial abolished/moral continues; cheirographon = Moses' book; Lev 23 Sabbath distinction). 2 I-B inferences address competing readings: I3 (Col 2:16 sabbaths, resolved Moderate toward Continues) and I6 (olam for ceremonies, resolved Strong toward Continues). 1 I-D inference (entire law abolished, I024) requires overriding multiple E-items (E143, E010-E011, E021, E025, E039, E031-E033).
