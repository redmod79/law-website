## [G4639](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4639/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - skia (shadow)
**Original:** σκιά
**Transliteration:** skiá
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** "shade" or a shadow (literally or figuratively)

### Occurrences (7 total)
- shadow (4), a shadow (2), the shadow (1)

### Key Verses
- **Col 2:17** -- "Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ."
- **Heb 10:1** -- "For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things..."
- **Heb 8:5** -- "Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things..."
- Mat 4:16 -- "shadow of death" (literal/figurative)
- Mrk 4:32 -- "under the shadow of it" (literal)
- Luk 1:79 -- "in the shadow of death" (literal/figurative)
- Acts 5:15 -- "the shadow of Peter" (literal)

### Significance
The word skia is applied specifically to the ceremonial system -- sacrifices, feasts, and sanctuary service -- describing them as shadows of the reality found in Christ. The word implies temporality: a shadow exists only in relation to the substance that casts it. Once the substance (Christ) has come, the shadow has served its purpose. This word is NEVER applied to the moral law/Decalogue in Scripture.

## [G5179](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5179/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - typos (type, pattern, figure)
**Original:** τύπος
**Transliteration:** týpos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** a die (as struck); a stamp or scar; a shape, style, resemblance; a model for imitation

### Occurrences (13 total)
- ensamples (2), figures (1), fashion (1), manner (1), pattern (1), form (1), examples (1), etc.

### Key Verses
- **Acts 7:44** -- "Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion [typos] that he had seen."
- **Heb 8:5** -- "See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern [typos] shewed to thee in the mount."
- **Rom 5:14** -- "Adam...who is the figure [typos] of him that was to come."
- 1Co 10:6 -- "these things were our examples [typos]"
- 1Co 10:11 -- "they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come"

### Significance
Applied to the tabernacle pattern Moses received (Acts 7:44; Heb 8:5), establishing that the earthly sanctuary was a copy/type of the heavenly original. Also used for Adam as a type of Christ (Rom 5:14). The word reinforces the forward-pointing, representational nature of the ceremonial system.

## [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - dogma (decree, ordinance)
**Original:** δόγμα
**Transliteration:** dógma
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun
**Definition:** a law (civil, ceremonial or ecclesiastical); a decree, ordinance

### Occurrences (5 total in NT)
- decrees (2): Luk 2:1 (Caesar's decree), Acts 17:7 (decrees of Caesar)
- a decree (1): Acts 16:4 (apostolic decrees)
- ordinances (1): Col 2:14 ("handwriting of ordinances")
- of ordinances (1): Eph 2:15 ("law of commandments contained in ordinances")

### Key Verses
- **Eph 2:15** -- "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances [en dogmasin]"
- **Col 2:14** -- "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances [tois dogmasin] that was against us"
- Luk 2:1 -- "a decree [dogma] from Caesar Augustus" (civil decree)
- Acts 16:4 -- "the decrees [ta dogmata] that were ordained of the apostles" (ecclesiastical)
- Acts 17:7 -- "contrary to the decrees [dogmaton] of Caesar" (civil decree)

### Significance
**CRITICAL FINDING:** dogma is used 5 times in the NT. It NEVER refers to the moral law/Decalogue. In the two passages where it describes what was abolished (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14), it refers to ceremonial ordinances/decrees. In the other three occurrences, it refers to civil or ecclesiastical decrees. This vocabulary distinction is consistent: the NT uses dogma for what was "abolished" or "nailed to the cross," not entole (commandment) which is used for the moral law.

## [G1379](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1379/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - dogmatizo (to subject to ordinances)
**Original:** δογματίζω
**Transliteration:** dogmatízō
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** to prescribe by statute; to submit to ceremonial rules

### Occurrences (1 total)
- Col 2:20 -- "are ye subject to ordinances [dogmatizesthe]"

### Key Verse
- **Col 2:20** -- "Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances [dogmatizesthe]?"

### Significance
The verbal form of dogma, used only once in the NT, in the same context as Col 2:14 (the nailing of the cheirographon). Paul asks why believers would return to submitting to ceremonial regulations ("Touch not; taste not; handle not" -- v.21) that have been abolished.

---

## [G5498](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5498/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - cheirographon (handwriting)
**Original:** χειρόγραφον
**Transliteration:** cheirógraphon
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun
**Definition:** something hand-written; a manuscript; a legal document, bond

### Occurrences (1 total)
- Col 2:14 -- "the handwriting [to cheirographon]"

### Key Verse
- **Col 2:14** -- "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances [to cheirographon tois dogmasin] that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross"

### Significance
**CRITICAL FINDING:** cheirographon is a compound of cheir (hand, G5495) + grapho (write, G1125). It literally means "something written by hand." This contrasts directly with the Decalogue, which was "written with the finger of God" (Exo 31:18). The Decalogue was NOT written by a human hand. What was "nailed to the cross" was the hand-written document -- pointing to the book of the law written by Moses' hand (Deu 31:9,24), not the tables of stone written by God's finger. This is a hapax legomenon (appears only once in the NT), making its contextual meaning particularly significant.

## [G4376](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4376/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - prosphora (offering, presentation)
**Original:** προσφορά
**Transliteration:** prosphorá
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** presentation; an oblation (bloodless) or sacrifice

### Occurrences (9 total)
- offering (5), an offering (2), offerings (1), offering up (1)

### Key Verses (concentrated in Hebrews 10)
- **Heb 10:5** -- "Sacrifice and offering [prosphoran] thou wouldest not"
- **Heb 10:8** -- "Sacrifice and offering [prosphoran]...which are offered by the law"
- **Heb 10:10** -- "through the offering [prosphoras] of the body of Jesus Christ once for all"
- **Heb 10:14** -- "by one offering [prosphora] he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified"
- **Heb 10:18** -- "there is no more offering [prosphora] for sin"
- Eph 5:2 -- "an offering and a sacrifice to God"

### Significance
Concentrated in Heb 10 where the argument contrasts the repeated, insufficient Levitical offerings with Christ's one offering. The word encompasses both bloodless (grain) and blood offerings.

## [G2378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - thysia (sacrifice)
**Original:** θυσία
**Transliteration:** thysía
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** sacrifice (the act or the victim, literally or figuratively)

### Occurrences (27 total)
- sacrifices (12), sacrifice (10), a sacrifice (2), Sacrifice (2), the sacrifice (1)

### Key Verses
- **Heb 10:1** -- "can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year..."
- **Heb 10:5** -- "Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not"
- **Heb 10:11** -- "offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins"
- **Heb 10:12** -- "after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever"
- **Heb 9:26** -- "to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself"
- **Heb 13:15** -- "the sacrifice of praise" (figurative in new covenant)
- **Heb 13:16** -- "with such sacrifices God is well pleased" (doing good, figurative)
- Mat 9:13; 12:7 -- Jesus quoting Hos 6:6: "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice"

### Significance
The dominant noun for sacrifice in the NT, especially in Hebrews where 15 of 27 occurrences appear. Hebrews systematically contrasts the repeated Levitical thysia with Christ's single, perfect thysia. After Christ, thysia shifts to figurative use (praise, doing good, living sacrifice -- Rom 12:1).

## [H2076](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2076/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - zabach (to slaughter in sacrifice) / [H2077](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2077/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - zebach (sacrifice)
**Original:** זָבַח / זֶבַח

- **1Sa 15:22** -- "Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices [zebach]?"
- **Hos 6:6** -- "I desired mercy, and not sacrifice [zebach]"

### Significance
The primary OT vocabulary for animal sacrifice. Used in Dan 9:27 for the sacrifice that would "cease" -- a prophecy pointing to the end of the sacrificial system at the cross.

## [H8002](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8002/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - shelem (peace offering)
**Original:** שֶׁלֶם
**Transliteration:** shelem
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** requital; a voluntary sacrifice in thanks; peace offering

### Occurrences (88 total)
- Predominantly "peace offerings" (various forms)

### Key Verses
- Lev 3:1 -- "And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering [shelem]..."
- Lev 7:11-15 -- Laws of the peace offering

### Significance
The peace offering (shelem, from shalom) was a voluntary, thanksgiving sacrifice. It represents communion and fellowship between God and the worshipper. Part of the ceremonial system pointing to reconciliation through Christ.

---

## [H3725](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3725/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - kippur (atonement, expiation)
**Original:** כִּפֻּר
**Transliteration:** kippur
**Part of Speech:** masculine plural noun
**Definition:** expiation; atonement (only in plural)

### Occurrences (8 total)
- Exo 29:36; 30:10,16; Lev 23:27,28; 25:9; Num 5:8; 29:11

### Key Verse
- **Lev 23:27** -- "Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement [kippur]"

### Significance
The source of "Yom Kippur" (Day of Atonement). The entire Day of Atonement ceremony (Lev 16) is the most elaborate ceremony in the ceremonial system, pointing forward to Christ's atoning work (Heb 9:7,12).

---

## [G2409](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2409/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - hiereus (priest) / [G2420](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2420/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - hierosyne (priesthood)
**Original:** ἱερεύς / ἱερωσύνη
**Transliteration:** hiereús / hierōsýnē
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun / feminine noun
**Definition:** a priest (literal or figurative) / sacredness, the priestly office

### Occurrences
- hiereus: 31 occurrences
- hierosyne: 4 occurrences (all in Heb 7:11,14)

### Key Verses
- **Heb 7:11** -- "If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood [hierosyne]..."
- **Heb 7:12** -- "For the priesthood [hierosyne] being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law."
- **Heb 5:6** -- "Thou art a priest [hiereus] for ever after the order of Melchisedec"
- **Rev 1:6; 5:10; 20:6** -- believers as "priests" (figurative)

### Significance
Hebrews argues that the Levitical priesthood was temporary and has been superseded by Christ's Melchizedek priesthood (Heb 7). The change of priesthood necessitates a "change of law" (Heb 7:12) -- specifically the law governing the priesthood (ceremonial, not moral). The figurative use for all believers (1Pe 2:9; Rev 1:6; 5:10; 20:6) shows the concept continues spiritually.

## [G4061](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4061/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - peritome (circumcision)
**Original:** περιτομή
**Transliteration:** peritomḗ
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** circumcision (the rite, the condition, or the people)

### Occurrences (32 total)
- circumcision (17), the circumcision (7), of circumcision (4), etc.

### Key Verses
- **1Co 7:19** -- "Circumcision [peritome] is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."
- **Gal 5:6** -- "For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision [peritome] availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love."
- **Gal 6:15** -- "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision [peritome] availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature."
- **Rom 4:11** -- "he received the sign of circumcision [peritomes], a seal of the righteousness of the faith"
- **Col 2:11** -- "circumcised with the circumcision [peritome] made without hands"
- **Php 3:3** -- "For we are the circumcision [peritome], which worship God in the spirit"

### Significance
Paul explicitly declares circumcision "nothing" while simultaneously affirming "keeping the commandments of God" (1Co 7:19). This verse alone distinguishes ceremonial (circumcision = nothing) from moral (commandments = everything). The shift from physical to spiritual circumcision (Rom 2:28-29; Php 3:3; Col 2:11) mirrors the shift from shadow to substance in the broader ceremonial system.

## [G3316](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3316/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - mesites (mediator)
**Original:** μεσίτης
**Transliteration:** mesítēs
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** a go-between; an internunciator; a reconciler; a mediator

### Occurrences (6 total)
- the mediator (3), of a mediator (1), a mediator (1), mediator (1)

### Key Verses
- **Gal 3:19** -- "it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator [mesites]"
- **Gal 3:20** -- "Now a mediator [mesites] is not a mediator of one, but God is one."
- **1Ti 2:5** -- "one mediator [mesites] between God and men, the man Christ Jesus"
- **Heb 8:6** -- "he is the mediator [mesites] of a better covenant"
- **Heb 9:15** -- "he is the mediator [mesites] of the new testament"
- **Heb 12:24** -- "Jesus the mediator [mesites] of the new covenant"

### LXX Usage
- Deu 5:5 -- Moses' mediating role
- Job 9:33 -- "neither is there any daysman [mesites] betwixt us"

### Significance
In Gal 3:19, the law that was "ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator" is the law given through Moses -- the mediated law. This contrasts with the Decalogue, which God spoke directly ("face to face" -- Deu 5:4). The mesites vocabulary reinforces the distinction between direct (Decalogue) and mediated (ceremonial) delivery.

## [G1345](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1345/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - dikaioma (ordinance, righteous requirement)
**Original:** δικαίωμα
**Transliteration:** dikaíōma
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun
**Definition:** an equitable deed; a statute or decision; a righteous requirement

### Occurrences (10 total)
- ordinances (3), righteousness (3), judgment (1), justification (1), the righteousness (1), judgments (1)

### Key Verses
- **Heb 9:1** -- "the first covenant had also ordinances [dikaiomata] of divine service"
- **Heb 9:10** -- "carnal ordinances [dikaiomata], imposed on them until the time of reformation"
- **Rom 8:4** -- "that the righteousness [dikaioma] of the law might be fulfilled in us"
- Luk 1:6 -- "walking in all the commandments and ordinances [dikaiomasi] of the Lord blameless"
- Rom 1:32 -- "the judgment [dikaioma] of God"
- Rom 2:26 -- "the righteousness [dikaiomata] of the law"

### Significance
In Heb 9:1,10, dikaioma is explicitly modified by "of divine service" and "carnal" -- limiting it to the sanctuary/ceremonial system. In Rom 8:4, the same word (unmodified) refers to "the righteousness of the law" fulfilled in believers who "walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" -- pointing to moral requirements. The modifier determines the referent: "carnal ordinances" = ceremonial; "righteousness of the law" = moral.

## [H8451](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8451/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - towrah (law, instruction)
**Original:** תּוֹרָה
**Transliteration:** tôwrâh
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** a precept or statute, especially the Decalogue or Pentateuch; law, instruction

### Occurrences (244 total)
- the law (60), of the law (28), law (24), thy law (20), in the law (19), etc.

### Key Verses
- **Deu 31:9** -- "Moses wrote this law [towrah]"
- **Deu 31:24** -- "Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law [towrah] in a book"
- **Deu 31:26** -- "Take this book of the law [towrah], and put it in the side of the ark"
- **Lev 7:37** -- "This is the law [towrah] of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, of the sin offering, of the trespass offering..."
- **Lev 11:46** -- "This is the law [towrah] of the beasts"
- **Lev 14:2** -- "This shall be the law [towrah] of the leper"
- **Psa 40:8** -- "thy law [towrah] is within my heart"
- **Psa 119:97** -- "O how love I thy law [towrah]!"

### Significance
Towrah has a broad semantic range: it can refer to specific ceremonial regulations (Lev 7:37 -- "the law of the burnt offering"), to the whole Pentateuch, or to God's instruction generally. Context determines the referent. In Deu 31:9,24,26, "this law" refers to the book Moses wrote and placed BESIDE the Ark -- distinct from the Ten Commandments placed INSIDE the Ark (Deu 10:5). This contextual distinction is crucial for understanding which "law" is in view in any given passage.
