# Verse Analysis

```
INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by those who say the law continues, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by those who say the law is abolished, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says. Do not use editorial characterizations like "genuine tension," "strongest argument," "most significant challenge," "honestly acknowledge," or "non-intuitive reading." Simply state what each passage says and what each side infers from it.
- When presenting findings, state: "The text says X" (explicit). Then state: "From this, Y interpretation infers Z" and "W interpretation infers V" (inferred).
- Never use language like "irrefutable," "obviously," or "clearly proves." Use "the text states," "this is consistent with."
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.

## Focus Area 1: Sacrificial Offerings (Lev 1-7)

### Leviticus 1:1-4
**Context:** The opening of the sacrificial legislation given at the tabernacle of the congregation after Sinai.
**Direct statement:** "The LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel..." The ceremonial sacrificial law is delivered TO Moses, who is then to relay it TO the people. The formula "the LORD spake unto Moses" is the standard delivery formula for the ceremonial system.
**Key observations:** This delivery mode contrasts with Exodus 20:1 ("God spake all these words" -- directly to the people). The Decalogue was spoken by God's voice to the assembled nation (E001); the sacrificial regulations were given to Moses privately and relayed. This is the mediated delivery mode documented in law-03 (N001, N014, N015).
**Cross-references:** Deu 4:13-14 (E101) explicitly distinguishes "his covenant, even ten commandments" from the "statutes and judgments" Moses was commanded to teach. Lev 26:46 (E108) confirms these laws came "by the hand of Moses."

### Psalm 40:6-8 (Prophetic: Sacrifices Not Ultimately Desired)
**Context:** A Messianic psalm, quoted in Hebrews 10:5-7.
**Direct statement:** "Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart."
**Key observations:** The speaker (the Messiah, per Hebrews) declares that sacrifices and offerings were not God's ultimate purpose. What God desired was obedience to His will -- with "thy law" within the heart. The text draws a contrast between the sacrificial system (not the ultimate desire) and God's law within the heart (the true desire). The phrase "thy law is within my heart" uses towrah (H8451), the same word for the Decalogue/God's instruction.
**Cross-references:** Hebrews 10:5-10 quotes this passage to argue that Christ's coming ("a body hast thou prepared me") replaced the animal sacrificial system with a single, perfect offering. The author of Hebrews uses this to establish that the sacrificial system was temporary and typological.

### 1 Samuel 15:22 (Obedience Over Sacrifice)
**Context:** Samuel rebuking Saul for keeping the spoils of the Amalekite war instead of obeying God's command.
**Direct statement:** "Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice."
**Key observations:** The text establishes a hierarchy: obedience to God's command ranks above the sacrificial system. "Obeying the voice of the LORD" is contrasted with "burnt offerings and sacrifices." This is consistent with the pattern seen in Psalm 40:6-8 and Hosea 6:6.

### Hosea 6:6 (Mercy Over Sacrifice)
**Context:** God speaking through the prophet about Israel and Judah's inconstancy.
**Direct statement:** "I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings."
**Key observations:** God states that mercy (chesed) and the knowledge of God are His true desire -- not animal sacrifice. Jesus quotes this verse twice (Mat 9:13; 12:7) to the Pharisees. The text places moral duty (mercy, knowledge of God) above ceremonial observance (sacrifice, burnt offerings).

### Micah 6:6-8 (What the LORD Requires)
**Context:** A prophetic courtroom scene where the people ask what God requires.
**Direct statement:** The people offer escalating sacrificial proposals (burnt offerings, calves, thousands of rams, ten thousands of rivers of oil, firstborn). God answers: "He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"
**Key observations:** The text exhausts the sacrificial possibilities (from simple offering to child sacrifice) and declares them insufficient. What God requires is moral: justice, mercy, humble walking with God. The word "man" (adam) gives this universal scope. The contrast is between ceremonial/ritual observance and moral character.

---

## Focus Area 2: Feast Days and Holy Convocations (Lev 23)

### Leviticus 23:1-3 (Weekly Sabbath -- Set Apart)
**Context:** The chapter opens with a list of "the feasts of the LORD."
**Direct statement:** The weekly Sabbath is listed first (v.3): "Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings."
**Key observations:** The weekly Sabbath is mentioned first but is then separated from the annual feasts that follow. Verse 3 ends with the designation "the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings." The annual feasts begin with a new introduction in v.4.

### Leviticus 23:4-36 (The Annual Feast Calendar)
**Context:** After the weekly Sabbath introduction, the annual feasts are presented in chronological order.
**Direct statement:** The text lists: Passover (v.5), Unleavened Bread (vv.6-8), Firstfruits (vv.9-14), Pentecost/Weeks (vv.15-21), Trumpets (vv.23-25), Day of Atonement (vv.26-32), and Tabernacles (vv.33-36). Each feast has its own calendar date, ritual requirements, and in some cases "sabbath" rest days (vv.24, 32, 39).
**Key observations:** The annual feast sabbaths are called "sabbath" (shabbathon) but are tied to specific calendar dates rather than the weekly cycle. The Day of Atonement sabbath falls "on the tenth day of this seventh month" (v.27) regardless of which day of the week that is. These are date-based, not cycle-based. The weekly Sabbath is cycle-based (every seventh day).

### Leviticus 23:37-38 (The Critical Distinction)
**Context:** The closing summary of the annual feast calendar.
**Direct statement:** "These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD... **Beside the sabbaths of the LORD**, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD."
**Key observations:** The text explicitly states that the feast system is "beside the sabbaths of the LORD." The Hebrew milled (beside, apart from) places the feast days in a different category from "the sabbaths of the LORD" (weekly Sabbath). The text itself makes the distinction. The annual feasts are additional observances beyond the weekly Sabbath. This verse provides an internal textual warrant for distinguishing the weekly Sabbath from the annual ceremonial sabbaths.
**Cross-references:** Colossians 2:16-17 lists "sabbath days" (sabbaton) among items that are "a shadow." The Lev 23:37-38 distinction provides contextual evidence for which "sabbath days" are shadows: the annual feast sabbaths that are "beside the sabbaths of the LORD." *(Examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Col 2:16-17.)*

### Leviticus 23:44 (Closing: Moses Declared)
**Context:** Final verse of the chapter.
**Direct statement:** "And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD."
**Key observations:** Moses is the one who "declared" (dabar) the feasts -- consistent with the mediated delivery mode. The weekly Sabbath was part of the Decalogue spoken by God's own voice; the annual feasts were communicated through Moses.

---

## Focus Area 3: Purity Regulations (Lev 11-15)

### Leviticus 11:1-2, 44-47 (Clean/Unclean Animals)
**Context:** Dietary regulations given through Moses and Aaron.
**Direct statement:** "The LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, Speak unto the children of Israel..." (v.1-2). The purpose: "Ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy" (v.44). "This is the law of the beasts" (v.46) -- towrah used for these specific regulations.
**Key observations:** The delivery formula is mediated ("spake unto Moses and to Aaron"). The rationale connects to God's holiness, but the specific regulations (which animals are clean/unclean) are detailed ceremonial prescriptions. Note that the clean/unclean distinction pre-dates the Levitical codification (Gen 7:2, E070, N006) -- Noah knew it. This distinction was pre-existing; the Levitical regulations codified and expanded it.

### Leviticus 12:6-8 (Purification After Childbirth)
**Context:** Regulations for a woman's purification after giving birth.
**Direct statement:** She is to bring "a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest."
**Key observations:** This regulation is tied to the sacrificial system and the sanctuary service. It requires a priest, a specific sacrifice, and the tabernacle. Without a functioning temple, priesthood, and sacrificial system, this regulation cannot be literally observed. Its observability is bound to the ceremonial infrastructure.

### Luke 2:22 (Mary's Purification)
**Context:** Joseph and Mary bringing Jesus to the temple after his birth.
**Direct statement:** "When the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem."
**Key observations:** Luke explicitly attributes the purification law to "the law of Moses" (ton nomon Mouseos). This is the NT identification: the purity regulations belong to the law of Moses, the mediated legislation. The NT writer distinguishes this as Mosaic law.

---

## Focus Area 4: Sanctuary/Tabernacle Service (Exo 25-30)

### Exodus 25:1-2, 8-9, 16, 40 (Pattern and Purpose)
**Context:** God gives Moses the sanctuary instructions on the mountain.
**Direct statement:** "The LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel..." (mediated delivery). The purpose: "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them" (v.8). The method: "According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle" (v.9). "Look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount" (v.40).
**Key observations:** The sanctuary instructions are given to Moses alone on the mountain, not to the assembled people (E105). The word "pattern" (tabnith, H8403) appears twice -- the earthly sanctuary is a copy of a heavenly original. This forward-pointing, representational character is central to the author of Hebrews' argument (Heb 8:5; 9:23-24). The tablets of testimony are to be placed inside the ark (v.16, E007) -- the moral law is housed within the sanctuary system, yet it was given separately and directly by God.

### Acts 7:44 (Stephen's Testimony)
**Context:** Stephen's speech before the Sanhedrin reviewing Israel's history.
**Direct statement:** "Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion [typos] that he had seen."
**Key observations:** Stephen uses the Greek typos (G5179) for the heavenly pattern. The tabernacle was a copy/type. Stephen, in the NT, maintains the typological language for the sanctuary.

### Hebrews 8:1-2, 5 (Shadow of Heavenly Things)
**Context:** The Hebrews author summarizes his argument about Christ's priesthood.
**Direct statement:** "We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man" (8:1-2). "Who serve unto the example and shadow [skia] of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern [typos] shewed to thee in the mount" (8:5).
**Key observations:** The text calls the earthly sanctuary service a "shadow" (skia, G4639) and "example" (hypodeigma, G5262) of heavenly things. The earthly service was representational. Christ ministers in "the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man." The word skia is the same word used in Heb 10:1 and Col 2:17 for the ceremonial system as shadow.

### Hebrews 9:1-10 (First Covenant Ordinances)
**Context:** The author describes the tabernacle and its service in detail.
**Direct statement:** "The first covenant had also ordinances [dikaiomata] of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary" (v.1). The tabernacle had two compartments: the Holy Place (v.2) and the Most Holy Place (v.3-5). The high priest entered the Most Holy Place "once every year, not without blood" (v.7). "The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing" (v.8). "Which was a figure [parabole] for the time then present" (v.9). "Carnal ordinances [dikaiomata sarkos], imposed on them until the time of reformation [diorthosis]" (v.10).
**Key observations:** The text uses multiple terms to describe the ceremonial system: "ordinances of divine service" (dikaiomata latreias), "figure" (parabole, G3850), "carnal ordinances" (dikaiomata sarkos). The phrase "imposed on them until the time of reformation" contains explicit temporal limitation. The word "until" (mechri) plus "the time of reformation" (kairou diorthoseos) indicates a designed endpoint. The ceremonial system was "for the time then present" -- not permanent.

### Hebrews 9:23-24 (Patterns of Things in the Heavens)
**Context:** The author explains why heavenly purification required better sacrifices.
**Direct statement:** "It was therefore necessary that the patterns [hypodeigmata] of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures [antitypa] of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us."
**Key observations:** The earthly sanctuary is called "patterns" (hypodeigmata) and "figures" (antitypa) of the true. Christ entered "heaven itself" -- the reality that the earthly sanctuary represented. The earthly was a copy; the heavenly is the original.

---

## Focus Area 5: Circumcision (Gen 17; Acts 15; Gal 5)

### Genesis 17:9-14 (Institution of Circumcision)
**Context:** God establishes circumcision as a covenant sign with Abraham.
**Direct statement:** "Every man child among you shall be circumcised...it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you...my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant...the uncircumcised man child...shall be cut off."
**Key observations:** The text uses "everlasting covenant" (berith olam) for circumcision. The penalty for non-observance is severe ("cut off"). This language might suggest permanence. However, note: the Abrahamic covenant itself is broader than the circumcision sign. Romans 4:11 will clarify: circumcision was "a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised."

### Acts 15:1-11, 19-20, 24, 28-29 (Jerusalem Council)
**Context:** The apostolic council deliberates whether Gentile converts must be circumcised and keep the law of Moses.
**Direct statement:** Certain Judaizers taught: "Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved" (v.1). Peter responds: "Why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?" (v.10). "Through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved" (v.11). James declares: "We trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God" (v.19). The letter: "We gave no such commandment" regarding circumcision (v.24). The requirements for Gentile believers: abstain from idols, fornication, things strangled, and blood (v.29).
**Key observations:** The apostles and elders, with the Holy Spirit (v.28), determined that circumcision and "the law of Moses" (as required by the Judaizers) should not be imposed on Gentile believers. Peter calls this requirement a "yoke." The council's decision retains four requirements -- three of which concern food practices and one is moral (fornication). The text records an authoritative apostolic decision against requiring circumcision.

### Galatians 5:1-6 (Circumcision and Liberty)
**Context:** Paul's argument against the Judaizers in Galatia.
**Direct statement:** "If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing" (v.2). "He is a debtor to do the whole law" (v.3). "Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace" (v.4). "For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love" (v.6).
**Key observations:** Paul states circumcision "availeth nothing" (v.6). The issue is not the rite itself but reliance on it for justification. The contrast is between circumcision (ceremonial) and "faith which worketh by love" (moral/spiritual). Paul's statement is categorical about circumcision's value for salvation.

### 1 Corinthians 7:19 (Circumcision vs. Commandments)
**Context:** Paul addressing various life situations and calling.
**Direct statement:** "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."
**Key observations:** This verse places circumcision (a ceremonial rite) and the commandments of God (entole tou theou) in direct contrast. Circumcision = "nothing." Commandments of God = everything (the positive counterpart). The word entole (G1785) is the standard NT word for moral commandments (used in 1 Jn 5:3; Rev 12:17; 14:12). Paul simultaneously dismisses one category (ceremonial) while affirming another (moral commandments). This is a single-verse distinction between what is abolished and what continues.

### Romans 2:25-29 (True Circumcision)
**Context:** Paul's argument about Jewish and Gentile accountability before God.
**Direct statement:** "Circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision" (v.25). "He is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter" (v.29).
**Key observations:** Paul distinguishes outward, physical circumcision from inward, spiritual circumcision. The value of physical circumcision is contingent on moral law-keeping. The text moves from the physical ceremony to the spiritual reality -- from shadow to substance.

### Romans 4:9-12 (Circumcision as Seal, Not Source)
**Context:** Paul argues that Abraham was justified by faith before circumcision.
**Direct statement:** "He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised" (v.11).
**Key observations:** Circumcision was a "sign" and "seal" of a pre-existing righteousness by faith. It was not the source of righteousness. Abraham's faith (Gen 15:6) preceded his circumcision (Gen 17). The ceremony pointed to a spiritual reality that already existed.

### Deuteronomy 10:16; Jeremiah 4:4; Colossians 2:11 (Spiritual Circumcision)
**Context:** OT and NT texts on circumcision of the heart.
**Direct statement:** "Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart" (Deu 10:16). "Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart" (Jer 4:4). "In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ" (Col 2:11).
**Key observations:** Even in the OT, Moses and Jeremiah call for spiritual circumcision of the heart -- indicating the physical rite was not the ultimate purpose. Colossians 2:11 states believers receive a circumcision "made without hands" -- the spiritual reality replaces the physical ceremony. This pattern (physical ceremony pointing to spiritual reality) is consistent across both testaments.

---

## Focus Area 6: Typological/Forward-Pointing Purpose

### Hebrews 10:1-14 (Shadow vs. Reality)
**Context:** The author of Hebrews' sustained argument about the insufficiency of animal sacrifices.
**Direct statement:** "The law having a shadow [skia] of good things to come, and not the very image [eikon] of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect" (v.1). "It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins" (v.4). "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second" (v.9). "By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified" (v.14).
**Key observations:** "The law having a shadow" -- the referent of "the law" is identified by the verse itself: "those sacrifices which they offered year by year." The shadow is the sacrificial system, not the moral law. The word skia (G4639) denotes something temporary and representational. The contrast is between "the first" (repeated animal sacrifices) and "the second" (Christ's will/offering). "He taketh away the first" = the sacrificial system is removed. "He may establish the second" = Christ's sacrifice is established. The language of removal is applied to the sacrificial system specifically.

### Colossians 2:14-17 (Shadow of Things to Come)
**Context:** Paul addresses the Colossian heresy (likely a syncretistic blend of Jewish ceremonialism and proto-Gnostic philosophy).
**Direct statement:** "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances [cheirographon tois dogmasin] that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross" (v.14). "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ" (vv.16-17).
**Key observations:** The key vocabulary: cheirographon (G5498, hapax legomenon -- hand-written document), dogmasin (G1378, ordinances/decrees), skia (G4639, shadow). The cheirographon is something written by hand -- contrasting with the Decalogue written by God's finger (Exo 31:18). The dogma vocabulary was established in law-01 (E053, E054) as never referring to the moral law/Decalogue. The listed items (meat, drink, holyday, new moon, sabbath days) constitute a ceremonial calendar. The term "sabbath days" (sabbaton) in this list is examined in a later study. The text calls these items "a shadow of things to come" and contrasts them with "the body" (soma) which "is of Christ."

### Hebrews 9:9-10 (Figure for the Time Present)
**Context:** The author describes the tabernacle service.
**Direct statement:** "A figure [parabole] for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience" (v.9). "Carnal ordinances [dikaiomata sarkos], imposed on them until the time of reformation [diorthosis]" (v.10).
**Key observations:** The tabernacle service was a "figure" (parabole) -- a symbolic representation for a specific time period. The ordinances are called "carnal" (sarkos -- pertaining to the flesh) -- physical, external regulations. The phrase "imposed until" (mechri kairou diorthoseos) establishes a temporal limit. The word dikaioma (G1345) is used here with the modifier "carnal" -- the word study (04-word-studies.md) shows that dikaioma without the "carnal" modifier is used for the moral law's righteousness (Rom 8:4). The modifier determines the referent.

### 1 Corinthians 5:7 (Christ Our Passover)
**Context:** Paul addresses immorality in the Corinthian church.
**Direct statement:** "For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us."
**Key observations:** Paul explicitly identifies Christ as the antitype of the Passover lamb. The Passover ceremony (Exo 12; Lev 23:5) pointed forward to Christ. Once the reality (Christ's sacrifice) has come, the ceremony has been fulfilled. The typological relationship is stated by Paul, not inferred.

### John 1:29 (Lamb of God)
**Context:** John the Baptist sees Jesus approaching.
**Direct statement:** "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world."
**Key observations:** John identifies Jesus with the sacrificial lamb imagery. The OT sacrificial lambs pointed forward to this reality. The phrase "taketh away the sin of the world" states what the animal sacrifices could not do (Heb 10:4) but Christ does.

### Daniel 9:27 (Sacrifice and Oblation to Cease)
**Context:** The seventy-weeks prophecy.
**Direct statement:** "He shall cause the sacrifice [zebach] and the oblation [minchah] to cease."
**Key observations:** The text prophesies the end of the sacrificial system. The Hebrew zebach (H2077) and minchah (H4503) are the standard terms for animal sacrifice and grain offering respectively. The prophecy predicts the cessation of the entire sacrificial apparatus.

### Matthew 27:50-51; Mark 15:38; Luke 23:45 (Veil of Temple Rent)
**Context:** The moment of Jesus' death.
**Direct statement:** "The veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom."
**Key observations:** All three Synoptic Gospels record the tearing of the temple veil. The veil separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place (Exo 26:31-33; Heb 9:3). Its tearing "from the top to the bottom" indicates divine action (not human). This event signifies the end of the barrier between God and humanity maintained by the ceremonial system. The way into the Most Holy Place -- previously restricted to the high priest once a year (Heb 9:7) -- is now open through Christ.

---

## Focus Area 7: Origin Through Moses as Mediator

### Deuteronomy 4:13-14 (Moses Distinguishes Two Categories)
**Context:** Moses' retrospective speech to Israel before entering the Promised Land.
**Direct statement:** "He declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments."
**Key observations:** This passage was thoroughly analyzed in law-03 (E101, N013). Moses uses two designations: "his covenant, even ten commandments" (God declared, God wrote) vs. "statutes and judgments" (God commanded Moses to teach). The two categories have different delivery agents and different designations. The ceremonial system falls within the "statutes and judgments" that Moses was commanded to teach.

### Deuteronomy 5:22 (He Added No More)
**Context:** Moses recounting the Sinai event.
**Direct statement:** "These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more."
**Key observations:** Analyzed in law-03 (E002, N014). The phrase "he added no more" marks the boundary. Everything after this point -- including all ceremonial legislation -- came through Moses as mediator. The Decalogue alone was spoken directly.

### Leviticus 1:1 (The Mediated Formula)
**Context:** Opening of the sacrificial legislation.
**Direct statement:** "And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him."
**Key observations:** This formula ("the LORD spake unto Moses") is repeated throughout Leviticus (over 30 times). It is the standard delivery mode for all ceremonial legislation. The contrast with Exodus 20:1 ("God spake all these words") is textually observable.

### Leviticus 26:46 (By the Hand of Moses)
**Context:** Closing of the Levitical legislation.
**Direct statement:** "These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses."
**Key observations:** This closing verse attributes the statutes, judgments, and laws to delivery "by the hand of Moses" (E108). The phrase "by the hand of Moses" (beyad Mosheh) identifies the mediator. The Levitical legislation is mediated law.

### Galatians 3:19-20 (Ordained in the Hand of a Mediator)
**Context:** Paul's argument about the purpose and duration of the law.
**Direct statement:** "Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one."
**Key observations:** Paul says the law was given "in the hand of a mediator" (en cheiri mesitou). The word mesites (G3316) is used. Paul then contrasts: "a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one." This is consistent with the Exodus narrative: the mediated legislation came through Moses (a go-between between two parties); the Decalogue came from God directly (God is one -- He acted without an intermediary for the Decalogue). The referent of "the law" in this passage is debated (I-B item I016 from law-03). The text says "the law" was "added because of transgressions, till the seed should come" -- indicating temporal limitation ("till").

---

## Focus Area 8: Medium (Book, Not Stone) and Repository (Beside, Not Inside)

### Exodus 31:18 (God's Finger on Stone)
**Context:** After giving the tabernacle instructions, God gives Moses the physical tablets.
**Direct statement:** "He gave unto Moses...two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God."
**Key observations:** Established in law-01 (E003) and law-03. The Decalogue is written by God's finger (etsba Elohim) on stone (eben). The medium is permanent. The author is God.

### Deuteronomy 10:1-5 (Tables Inside the Ark)
**Context:** Moses recounts the making of the second set of tablets.
**Direct statement:** "I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables...and thou shalt put them in the ark" (v.2). "He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments" (v.4). "I...put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me" (v.5).
**Key observations:** Established in law-01 (E007) and law-03. The tablets were placed INSIDE the ark. The replacement has identical content (N005).

### Deuteronomy 31:9, 24-26 (Moses Wrote in a Book -- Beside the Ark)
**Context:** At the end of Moses' life, he completes writing the law.
**Direct statement:** "Moses wrote this law" (v.9). "When Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished" (v.24). "Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee" (v.26).
**Key observations:** Established in law-01 (E009) and law-03. Moses is the writer. The medium is a book (sepher). The repository is "in the side of" (mitstsad) the ark -- BESIDE it, not inside. The stated purpose is "a witness against thee." The contrast: (1) God wrote on stone, placed inside the ark -- no negative characterization. (2) Moses wrote in a book, placed beside the ark -- characterized as "a witness against thee."

### 1 Kings 8:9 / 2 Chronicles 5:10 (Nothing Inside but Two Tables)
**Context:** The dedication of Solomon's temple.
**Direct statement:** "There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone."
**Key observations:** Confirmed in two independent passages. Only the Decalogue tablets occupied the interior of the ark. The book of the law was not inside. The exclusivity is stated.

### Colossians 2:14 and the Cheirographon
**Context:** Paul describes what Christ accomplished at the cross.
**Direct statement:** "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances [to cheirographon tois dogmasin]."
**Key observations:** The word cheirographon (G5498) is a compound: cheir (hand) + grapho (write) = "hand-written document." This is a hapax legomenon in the NT. The word study (04-word-studies.md) establishes that cheirographon literally means something written by human hand. The Decalogue was NOT written by a human hand -- it was written by "the finger of God" (Exo 31:18). What was written by a human hand was the book of the law written by Moses (Deu 31:9, 24). What was "nailed to his cross" was therefore the hand-written document of ordinances (dogma), not the God-written tablets of testimony.

## Focus Area 9: Character and Purpose Contrast

### Romans 7:12, 14 (Moral Law: Holy, Just, Good, Spiritual)
**Context:** Paul's argument about the law and sin in Romans 7.
**Direct statement:** "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (v.12). "The law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin" (v.14).
**Key observations:** Established in law-01 (E010, E011, N004). Paul identifies this law as the Decalogue by quoting the 10th commandment (v.7). Present tense: "IS holy...IS spiritual." The moral law has positive attributes mirroring God's character (N003).

### 1 John 3:4 (Sin = Transgression of the Law)
**Context:** John defines sin.
**Direct statement:** "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law."
**Key observations:** Established in law-01 (E023). The moral law defines sin. If the law ceases, the definition of sin is vacated (I001).

### Psalm 111:7-8 (Commandments Stand Fast Forever)
**Context:** A psalm of praise for God's works.
**Direct statement:** "All his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness."
**Key observations:** Established in law-01 (E014). The commandments "stand fast for ever and ever." Continuation vocabulary applied to God's commandments.

### Deuteronomy 31:26 (Book of the Law: A Witness Against Thee)
**Context:** Moses places the book of the law beside the ark.
**Direct statement:** "That it may be there for a witness against thee."
**Key observations:** The book of the law (the mediated legislation including ceremonial law) is characterized as "a witness against thee" -- an adversarial characterization. Compare with the moral law: "holy, just, good, spiritual" (Rom 7:12, 14). The two bodies of legislation receive markedly different characterizations.

### Hebrews 9:10 (Carnal Ordinances, Imposed Until Reformation)
**Context:** Description of the first-covenant service.
**Direct statement:** "Carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation."
**Key observations:** The ceremonial ordinances are called "carnal" (sarkos -- fleshly, pertaining to the body). The moral law is called "spiritual" (pneumatikos -- Rom 7:14). The ceremonial system has a temporal limit ("until"). The moral law "stands fast for ever" (Psa 111:7-8). The contrast: carnal vs. spiritual; temporary vs. eternal.

## Focus Area 10: NT Cessation Vocabulary

### Colossians 2:14-23 (Full Passage Analysis)
**Key vocabulary:** cheirographon (G5498, hand-written), dogmasin (G1378, ordinances/decrees), dogmatizesthe (G1379, subject to ordinances), skia (G4639, shadow).
**Observations:** Every term Paul uses for what was abolished is ceremonial vocabulary. The listed items (meat, drink, holy day, new moon, sabbath days) are ceremonial calendar items. The appended practices ("Touch not; taste not; handle not") concern physical handling. Paul calls these "the commandments and doctrines of men" (v.22) and says they "perish with the using." None of this vocabulary is applied to the moral law.

### Ephesians 2:14-16 (Abolished in His Flesh)
**Key vocabulary:** dogmasin (G1378), "the law of commandments contained in ordinances."
**Observations:** The phrase "the law of commandments contained in ordinances" (ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin) specifies the type of law: it is the law characterized by ordinances (dogma). The purpose of abolishing this was to make "of twain one new man" -- unifying Jew and Gentile. The ceremonial system (circumcision, dietary laws, feast days) was the "middle wall of partition" between Jew and Gentile. The moral law (do not murder, do not steal, etc.) was never a dividing wall between Jew and Gentile -- Gentiles had these principles written on their hearts (Rom 2:14-15).

### Hebrews 7:11-19 (Priesthood Changed = Law Changed)
**Key vocabulary:** hierosyne (G2420, priesthood), entole sarkines (carnal commandment), athetesis (G115, disannulling).
**Observations:** The Hebrews author argues: "The priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law" (v.12). Which law? The law governing the priesthood -- the ceremonial law that established the Levitical order. Christ's priesthood is "not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life" (v.16). The word "carnal" (sarkinos) appears again -- the same descriptor used in 9:10 for the ceremonial ordinances. "There is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof" (v.18). The "commandment going before" is the law of the Levitical priesthood -- not the moral law, which is "holy, just, good, spiritual" (Rom 7:12, 14) and "perfect" (Psa 19:7). The terms "weak" and "unprofitable" contrast with the moral law's characterization.

### Hebrews 8:1-13 (New Covenant; First Made Old)
**Observations:** The argument is about the covenant arrangement, not the moral law itself. Verse 10 states the new covenant writes "my laws" on hearts. Verse 13 states the "first" covenant arrangement "decayeth and waxeth old." The law itself is internalized (v.10); the system/arrangement changes. The moral content continues in a new medium (hearts instead of stone -- cf. 2 Cor 3:3, E118).

### Hebrews 10:15-18 (No More Offering for Sin)
**Direct statement:** "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them" (v.16). "Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin" (v.18).
**Key observations:** Two facts stated: (1) In the new covenant, God's laws are written on hearts and minds -- the same law, internalized. (2) Since sins are remitted, "there is no more offering for sin" -- the sacrificial system has no further function. The moral law is written on hearts; the sacrificial system ceases. Both are stated in the same passage.

## Patterns Identified

1. **Consistent mediated delivery for all ceremonial legislation.** Every ceremonial regulation uses the formula "the LORD spake unto Moses" or equivalent. The Decalogue alone uses "God spake all these words" (to the people directly). This pattern holds across Leviticus, Exodus 25-31, Numbers, and Deuteronomy's retrospective.

2. **Shadow/type/figure vocabulary is exclusively applied to the ceremonial system.** The words skia (shadow), typos (type/pattern), parabole (figure), hypodeigma (example), antitypos (figure) are used for sacrifices, the tabernacle, and the feast calendar. None of these words is applied to the moral law/Decalogue.

3. **Cessation vocabulary targets the ceremonial system specifically.** Dogma (abolished), cheirographon (nailed to cross), dikaiomata sarkos (carnal ordinances, imposed until), "he taketh away the first" -- all refer to ceremonial elements. The moral law receives continuation vocabulary: holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal, established by faith, written on hearts.

4. **The ceremonial system is consistently characterized as insufficient.** "Cannot make perfect" (Heb 10:1), "not possible to take away sins" (Heb 10:4), "weak and unprofitable" (Heb 7:18), "could not make perfect as pertaining to conscience" (Heb 9:9). The moral law is characterized as "perfect, converting the soul" (Psa 19:7), "holy, just, good, spiritual" (Rom 7:12, 14).

5. **Circumcision provides a single-verse test case.** 1 Corinthians 7:19: "Circumcision is nothing...but the keeping of the commandments of God." Paul declares a specific ceremonial rite "nothing" while simultaneously affirming the commandments of God (entole tou theou). This verse distinguishes ceremonial from moral in a single statement.

6. **The OT prophets anticipated the ceremonial system's inadequacy.** Psalm 40:6-8, 1 Samuel 15:22, Hosea 6:6, Micah 6:6-8, Isaiah 1:11-14 all place moral duty above ceremonial observance. The prophets did not anticipate the moral law's cessation.

7. **Leviticus 23:37-38 provides internal ceremonial calendar vs. Sabbath distinction.** The annual feast sabbaths are "beside the sabbaths of the LORD." The text itself distinguishes the two categories.

## Connections Between Passages

The evidence from this study connects with the findings of law-01, law-02, and law-03 at multiple points:

- **Law-01** established the moral law's attributes (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal) and the Greek vocabulary distinction (entole for moral law, dogma for ceremonial ordinances). This study confirms: the ceremonial system receives the opposite characterization (carnal, weak, unprofitable, temporary, shadow).

- **Law-02** established that moral standards operated before Sinai (clean/unclean animals, murder, adultery, Sabbath). This study notes: the clean/unclean distinction (Gen 7:2) pre-dates the Levitical codification (Lev 11), but the detailed ceremonial regulations for purification, sacrifice, and temple service are Sinai-era additions through Moses.

- **Law-03** established five dimensions of distinction between the Decalogue and subsequent legislation (delivery mode, authorship, repository, naming, boundary). This study confirms: all five categories of ceremonial law (sacrifices, feasts, purity, sanctuary, circumcision) fall on the mediated/Moses-written/beside-the-ark side of every dimension.

## Word Study Insights

- **Skia (G4639):** Applied to the ceremonial system in three passages (Heb 10:1; Col 2:17; Heb 8:5). Never applied to the moral law/Decalogue.
- **Dogma (G1378):** Used 5 times in the NT, never for the moral law. The two passages about what was abolished (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14) both use dogma.
- **Cheirographon (G5498):** "Hand-written" -- a compound of cheir (hand) + grapho (write). Contrasts with the Decalogue written by "the finger of God." Hapax legomenon.
- **Dikaioma (G1345):** With the modifier "carnal" = ceremonial ordinances (Heb 9:1, 10). Without the modifier = moral righteousness of the law (Rom 8:4). The modifier determines the referent.
- **Peritome (G4061):** Paul calls circumcision "nothing" (1 Cor 7:19; Gal 5:6; 6:15) while affirming the commandments of God. The physical rite is dismissed; the spiritual reality continues.
- **Mesites (G3316):** Moses is the mediator of the ceremonial/mediated law (Gal 3:19-20). Christ is the mediator of the new covenant (Heb 8:6; 9:15; 12:24).

## Difficult Passages

### Hebrews 9:4 -- Contents of the Ark
The text states the Most Holy Place "had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant." This appears to list additional items inside the ark besides the two tables. However, 1 Kings 8:9 and 2 Chronicles 5:10 both state "there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone." The Hebrews passage may describe items associated with the ark (placed near or on it) rather than inside it. The Greek preposition "en" (in/at/near) has a broader semantic range than strict interior placement. The OT texts placing the pot of manna "before the LORD" (Exo 16:33-34) and Aaron's rod "before the testimony" (Num 17:10) suggest placement near the ark, not inside it.

### Galatians 3:19-25 -- Which "Law" Was Added?
Paul says "the law" was "added because of transgressions, till the seed should come" and was "our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ." The referent of "the law" is not specified as moral or ceremonial. The Continues position reads this as the ceremonial/regulatory system added alongside the pre-existing moral law. The Abolished position may read this as all Sinai legislation. This is an I-B item addressed in law-03 (I016) and will be examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Galatians 3. *(Examined in depth in law-XX-galatians-3.)*

### Leviticus 16:29, 34 -- "Everlasting Statute" for Atonement
The Day of Atonement is called "an everlasting statute" (chuqqat olam). The word olam can mean "perpetual/for an age" or "everlasting." This creates a textual observation: the same word olam is used for both the Decalogue's permanence (Psa 111:8 -- "for ever and ever") and the ceremonial Day of Atonement. However, Hebrews 9:10 states the ceremonial ordinances were "imposed until the time of reformation." The textual data includes both olam applied to the Day of Atonement and explicit temporal limitation ("until"). The resolution of this requires contextual analysis of olam's semantic range (it can denote duration appropriate to the subject rather than absolute infinity).

### Genesis 17:13 -- "Everlasting Covenant" for Circumcision
Circumcision is called a "berith olam" (everlasting covenant). Yet the NT apostles (Acts 15), Paul (Gal 5:2-6; 1 Cor 7:19), and the Jerusalem council all declare circumcision is no longer required. This textual data point shows that olam, when applied to ceremonies, can mean "for the duration of the dispensation" rather than "absolute eternity." The same word's meaning is determined by context and the nature of the subject.
