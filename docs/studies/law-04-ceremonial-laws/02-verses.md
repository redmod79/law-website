## Focus Area 1: Sacrificial Offerings (Lev 1-7)

### Leviticus 1:1-4 (Opening of Sacrificial Legislation)
> 1:1 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
> 1:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.
> 1:3 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.
> 1:4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

**Note:** The formula "the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him" -- the ceremonial law came THROUGH Moses, not by God's direct voice to the people (contrast Exo 20:1).

### Psalm 40:6-8 (Prophetic: Sacrifices Not Ultimately Desired)
> 40:6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
> 40:7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,
> 40:8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.

**Quoted in Hebrews 10:5-7.** The Messiah declares that sacrifices were not the ultimate purpose -- doing God's will was.

### 1 Samuel 15:22 (Obedience Over Sacrifice)
> Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.

### Hosea 6:6 (Mercy Over Sacrifice)
> For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.

### Micah 6:6-8 (What the LORD Requires)
> 6:6 Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?
> 6:7 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
> 6:8 He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?

> 23:38 **Beside the sabbaths of the LORD**, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.

**Closing:**
> 23:44 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.

**Note:** Lev 23:37-38 explicitly distinguishes the feast sabbaths from "the sabbaths of the LORD" (weekly Sabbath). The annual feasts are "beside" (in addition to) the weekly Sabbath.

> 2:20 Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,
> 2:21 (Touch not; taste not; handle not;
> 2:22 Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?
> 2:23 Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.

### Ephesians 2:14-16 (Abolished in His Flesh)
> 2:14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;
> 2:15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;
> 2:16 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:

### Hebrews 7:11-19 (Priesthood Changed = Law Changed)
> 7:11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
> 7:12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
> 7:14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
> 7:16 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.
> 7:17 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
> 7:18 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
> 7:19 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.

### Hebrews 8:1-13 (New Covenant; First Made Old)
> 8:1 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
> 8:2 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
> 8:5 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
> 8:6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
> 8:7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
> 8:10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
> 8:13 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.

### Hebrews 9:1-15 (First Covenant Ordinances)
> 9:1 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
> 9:2 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.
> 9:3 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;
> 9:4 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
> 9:5 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
> 9:6 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.
> 9:7 But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:
> 9:8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:
> 9:9 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
> 9:10 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.
> 9:11 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
> 9:12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.
> 9:14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
> 9:15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

### Hebrews 10:15-18 (No More Offering for Sin)
> 10:15 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
> 10:16 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
> 10:17 And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
> 10:18 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
