## law-01-gods-moral-law
Established the Decalogue's unique origin (God's voice, God's finger, stone, inside the Ark), attributes mirroring God's character (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal), and universal/eternal scope. 35 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items after gate analysis.

## law-02-law-before-sinai
Established moral law operating from creation to Sinai (Sabbath at creation, Cain's murder, clean/unclean animals, Abraham's obedience, Joseph's moral awareness, manna-Sabbath test). 6 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items.

## law-03-exodus-20-vs-later-laws
Established five dimensions of distinction between the Decalogue and subsequent legislation: delivery mode (direct vs. mediated), authorship (God's finger vs. Moses' hand), repository (inside vs. beside the Ark), naming conventions, and the "he added no more" boundary marker. Multi-author consistency across Exodus, Deuteronomy, Leviticus, Nehemiah, Hebrews, and Paul.

## ceremonial-laws (prior non-series study)
Identified five categories of ceremonial law (sacrifices, feasts, purity, sanctuary, circumcision) with their typological fulfillments. Documented the Lev 23:37-38 distinction: feast sabbaths are "beside the sabbaths of the LORD." Presented the contrast table between moral and ceremonial law across 9 dimensions.

## nt-commandments-vs-ordinances
- entole (G1785): 71 NT occurrences, consistently = moral commandments
- dogma (G1378): 5 NT occurrences, NEVER = moral commandments
- Eph 2:15: "en dogmasin" limits the scope to ceremonial decrees
- Col 2:14: cheirographon (hand-written) = Moses' hand, not God's finger
- 1CO 7:19: "Circumcision is nothing...but keeping the commandments of God" -- ceremonial vs. moral

## laws-abolished-at-cross
Every NT passage identifying something abolished uses ceremonial vocabulary (dogma, cheirographon, dikaioma qualified as "carnal"). Every NT passage affirming law's continuation identifies it as moral (entole, nomos with "holy, just, good, spiritual"). Dan 9:27 prophesied end of sacrificial system; Mat 27:51 veil rent = divine signal.

## sabbath-moral-or-ceremonial
