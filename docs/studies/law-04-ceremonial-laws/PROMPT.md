# Bible Study: The Ceremonial/Ritual Laws and Their Distinction from the Moral Law

## Question
What are the ceremonial/ritual laws and how do they differ from the moral law? Investigate the five categories: sacrifices (Lev 1-7), feasts (Lev 23:4-36), purity regulations (Lev 11-15), sanctuary service (Exo 25-30), and circumcision (Gen 17, Acts 15, Gal 5:2-6). Examine their typological/forward-pointing purpose (Heb 10:1, Col 2:17), their origin through Moses as mediator (not God's direct voice), their medium (book, not stone), their repository (beside the Ark, not inside), and every contrast with the Decalogue established in prior studies.

## Study Series Context
This is study **law-04** in the Law of God series. The methodology file is at `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-series-methodology.md`. The analysis agent MUST read and follow it, including the E/N/I classification framework, decision trees, and the investigative methodology block (include verbatim in analysis).

### Prior Study Conclusions (MUST READ for context)
- `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-01-gods-moral-law/CONCLUSION.md` -- Established the Decalogue's unique origin (God's voice, God's finger, stone, inside the Ark), attributes mirroring God's character (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal), and universal/eternal scope. 35 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items after gate analysis.
- `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-02-law-before-sinai/CONCLUSION.md` -- Established moral law operating from creation to Sinai (Sabbath at creation, Cain's murder, clean/unclean animals, Abraham's obedience, Joseph's moral awareness, manna-Sabbath test). 6 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items.
- `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-03-exodus-20-vs-later-laws/CONCLUSION.md` -- Established five dimensions of distinction between the Decalogue and subsequent legislation: delivery mode (direct vs. mediated), authorship (God's finger vs. Moses' hand), repository (inside vs. beside the Ark), naming conventions, and the "he added no more" boundary marker. Multi-author consistency across Exodus, Deuteronomy, Leviticus, Nehemiah, Hebrews, and Paul.

### Key Findings from Prior Studies to Build On
1. The Decalogue was spoken by God's own voice (Exo 20:1; Deu 5:4,22), written by God's finger (Exo 31:18), on stone (permanent medium), placed INSIDE the Ark (Exo 25:16; Deu 10:5). "He added no more" (Deu 5:22).
2. Moses wrote "this law" in a book (Deu 31:9,24), placed BESIDE the Ark (Deu 31:26) -- "a witness against thee."
3. Moses explicitly distinguished "his covenant, even ten commandments" from "statutes and judgments" (Deu 4:13-14).
4. NT cessation passages use dogma (G1378) for what was abolished -- a word NEVER used for the moral law. The moral law uses entole (G1785).
5. The moral law is "holy, just, good, spiritual" (Rom 7:12,14); the book of the law was "a witness against thee" (Deu 31:26).

#### Key Findings from Related Studies

**ceremonial-laws (CONCLUSION.md):**
- Identified five categories of ceremonial law (sacrifices, feasts, purity, sanctuary, circumcision) with their typological fulfillments
- Documented the Lev 23:37-38 distinction: feast sabbaths are "beside the sabbaths of the LORD"
- Presented the contrast table between moral and ceremonial law across 9 dimensions
- Christ fulfilled ceremonial system: 1CO 5:7; JHN 1:29; HEB 10:10-14

**nt-commandments-vs-ordinances (CONCLUSION.md):**
- entole (G1785): 71 NT occurrences, consistently = moral commandments
- dogma (G1378): 5 NT occurrences, NEVER = moral commandments
- Eph 2:15: "en dogmasin" limits the scope to ceremonial decrees
- Col 2:14: cheirographon (hand-written) = Moses' hand, not God's finger
- 1CO 7:19: "Circumcision is nothing...but keeping the commandments of God" -- ceremonial vs. moral

**laws-abolished-at-cross (CONCLUSION.md):**
- Every NT passage identifying something abolished uses ceremonial vocabulary (dogma, cheirographon, dikaioma qualified as "carnal")
- Every NT passage affirming law's continuation identifies it as moral (entole, nomos with "holy, just, good, spiritual")
- Dan 9:27 prophesied end of sacrificial system; Mat 27:51 veil rent = divine signal

### Focus Areas

1. **Five Categories of Ceremonial Law** -- Document each with specific verse references from tool output: (a) sacrificial offerings (Lev 1-7), (b) feasts (Lev 23:4-36), (c) purity regulations (Lev 11-15), (d) sanctuary service (Exo 25-30), (e) circumcision (Gen 17; Acts 15; Gal 5)

2. **Typological/Forward-Pointing Purpose** -- Gather all verses showing the ceremonial system as shadow/type/figure: Heb 10:1, Col 2:17, Heb 9:9, Heb 8:5, Heb 9:23-24. Each element pointed to Christ.

3. **Origin Through Moses as Mediator** -- Contrast the delivery mode of ceremonial law ("the LORD spake unto Moses," Lev 1:1; "by the hand of Moses," Lev 26:46) with the Decalogue's direct delivery ("God spake all these words," Exo 20:1). Build on law-03's findings about the two-stage giving.

4. **Medium (Book, Not Stone)** -- Contrast Moses writing in a book (Deu 31:9,24) with God writing on stone (Exo 31:18). The cheirographon (G5498) of Col 2:14 = hand-written document.

5. **Repository (Beside the Ark, Not Inside)** -- Deu 31:26 "in the side of the ark" vs. Exo 25:16 "inside the ark." Build on law-01/law-03's N-items about two repositories.

6. **Character and Purpose Contrast** -- Moral law: "holy, just, good" (Rom 7:12), defines sin (1Jn 3:4), eternal (Psa 111:7-8). Ceremonial law: "a witness against thee" (Deu 31:26), "carnal ordinances" (Heb 9:10), temporal ("until the time of reformation," Heb 9:10).

7. **NT Cessation Vocabulary Applied to Ceremonial System** -- Document that dogma, cheirographon, dikaioma-as-carnal are consistently applied to what was abolished, while entole is used for what remains.

8. **The Lev 23:37-38 Distinction** -- "Beside the sabbaths of the LORD" -- the annual feast sabbaths are explicitly distinguished from the weekly Sabbath.

9. **1 Corinthians 7:19** -- "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God" -- a single verse distinguishing ceremonial (nothing) from moral (everything).

10. **Every Contrast with the Decalogue** -- Compile a comprehensive contrast table using evidence from all prior studies.
