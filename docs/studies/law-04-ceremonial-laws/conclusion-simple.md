# What Are the Ceremonial Laws and How Do They Differ from the Moral Law?

## A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence

---

The Bible contains many different kinds of laws -- from "Thou shalt not kill" to instructions about animal sacrifices, festival observances, and priestly rituals. Are all these laws the same in nature and duration? Did they all end at the cross, or does the Bible distinguish between laws that were temporary and laws that are permanent?

This study examines the five main categories of ceremonial law found in Scripture -- sacrifices, feasts, purity regulations, sanctuary services, and circumcision -- and compares them directly to the Ten Commandments. The goal is to let the Bible speak for itself about whether these are different kinds of law with different purposes and different fates.

## The Five Categories of Ceremonial Law

The Bible describes five main categories of ceremonial or ritual law, each with distinct characteristics.

### Animal Sacrifices (Leviticus 1-7)

The sacrificial system was extensive, covering burnt offerings, grain offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings, and trespass offerings. These laws were delivered through Moses, not by God speaking directly to the people:

> "And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying..." (Leviticus 1:1)

This pattern -- God speaking to Moses, who then relayed the instructions -- continues throughout Leviticus. It is very different from the Ten Commandments, where God spoke directly to all the people at Sinai.

Even the Old Testament prophets recognized a hierarchy between obedience to God's moral commands and the sacrificial system:

> "Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." (1 Samuel 15:22)

> "For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings." (Hosea 6:6)

> "He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" (Micah 6:8)

### Annual Religious Festivals (Leviticus 23)

The yearly feast calendar included Passover, the Feast of Weeks, the Day of Atonement, and the Feast of Tabernacles. These were given through Moses:

> "And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD." (Leviticus 23:44)

Significantly, the Bible itself makes a careful distinction between these annual festivals and the weekly Sabbath. After listing the ceremonial feasts, Leviticus adds:

> "These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations...beside the sabbaths of the LORD." (Leviticus 23:37-38)

The word "beside" means "apart from" or "in addition to." The text itself separates the weekly Sabbath of the Ten Commandments from the annual ceremonial feast days.

### Purity Regulations (Leviticus 11-15)

The ceremonial laws governing ritual cleanliness included dietary restrictions, regulations about skin diseases, and various purification ceremonies. Luke's Gospel attributes the purification laws to "the law of Moses":

> "And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord." (Luke 2:22)

It is worth noting that the clean/unclean animal distinction itself predates the Levitical codification. Noah knew to differentiate clean and unclean animals (Genesis 7:2) long before the Levitical laws were given.

### Sanctuary Services (Exodus 25-30)

The tabernacle was built according to a heavenly pattern shown to Moses:

> "According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it." (Exodus 25:9)

This earthly sanctuary was a copy of something in heaven, designed to point forward to the reality found in Christ. The New Testament makes this explicit:

> "Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount." (Hebrews 8:5)

### Circumcision (Genesis 17; Acts 15; Galatians 5)

Circumcision was given to Abraham as a sign and seal of faith he already possessed:

> "And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised." (Romans 4:11)

Circumcision did not create righteousness; it was a ceremony pointing to a spiritual reality. The spiritual reality (circumcision of the heart) was always the deeper meaning:

> "Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked." (Deuteronomy 10:16)

> "In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands." (Colossians 2:11)

## How the New Testament Describes the Ceremonial System

The New Testament uses specific vocabulary to describe the ceremonial system -- vocabulary it never applies to the moral law. This vocabulary distinction is one of the most important pieces of evidence in the entire study.

**"Shadow" language.** The ceremonies were earthly copies pointing forward to Christ:

> "For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect." (Hebrews 10:1)

> "Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ." (Colossians 2:17)

The word "shadow" appears multiple times for the ceremonial system. A shadow exists only while the object casting it is approaching; once the object arrives, the shadow is no longer needed.

**"Carnal ordinances" with a time limit.** The Hebrews author describes the ceremonies in terms never used for the moral law:

> "Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation." (Hebrews 9:10)

"Carnal ordinances" stands in stark contrast to Paul's description of the moral law as "spiritual" (Romans 7:14). The phrase "until the time of reformation" sets an explicit time limit on the ceremonial system.

**"Handwriting of ordinances."** When Paul describes what was nailed to the cross, he uses specific vocabulary:

> "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross." (Colossians 2:14)

The Greek word for "handwriting" literally means a document written by human hand. The Ten Commandments were not written by a human hand -- they were "written with the finger of God" (Exodus 31:18). The word for "ordinances" is the Greek *dogma*, which refers to decrees and regulations. This word is never used for the moral law in the New Testament.

**"Weak and unprofitable."** The Hebrews author describes the former commandment (the Levitical priesthood system) as:

> "For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof." (Hebrews 7:18)

Compare this with Paul's description of the moral law: "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (Romans 7:12). The ceremonial system is called weak, unprofitable, and carnal. The moral law is called holy, just, good, and spiritual. The Bible uses opposite vocabulary for these two categories.

## The Purpose: Every Ceremony Pointed to Christ

The entire ceremonial system pointed forward to Jesus Christ and found its fulfillment in Him.

The sacrificial lamb pointed to Christ:

> "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world." (John 1:29)

The Passover pointed to Christ:

> "For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us." (1 Corinthians 5:7)

The high priest pointed to Christ:

> "But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood." (Hebrews 7:24)

The earthly sanctuary pointed to the heavenly one where Christ ministers:

> "For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us." (Hebrews 9:24)

The animal sacrifices could never accomplish what Christ's one sacrifice achieved:

> "For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins." (Hebrews 10:4)

> "But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God." (Hebrews 10:12)

Daniel had prophesied this transition centuries earlier:

> "And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease." (Daniel 9:27)

When Jesus died on the cross, the veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom (Matthew 27:51) -- a dramatic signal that the barrier maintained by the ceremonial system was no longer needed because the reality it pointed to had arrived.

## The Moral Law: A Different Story

While the ceremonial system was temporary and forward-pointing, the Bible presents a very different picture for the moral law. Perhaps the single most powerful verse demonstrating this distinction comes from the apostle Paul:

> "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God." (1 Corinthians 7:19)

In one sentence, Paul dismisses a ceremonial rite (circumcision) as "nothing" while affirming "the keeping of the commandments of God." Paul would not call something "nothing" in one breath and then affirm "the commandments of God" in the next if he believed all laws were the same. He distinguished between ceremonial requirements and moral commandments.

The New Testament consistently affirms the continuing relevance of God's moral law:

> "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." (Romans 3:31)

> "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." (Matthew 5:17-18)

Under the new covenant, the law is internalized rather than discarded:

> "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them." (Hebrews 10:16)

God's end-time people are identified by their relationship to the commandments:

> "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." (Revelation 14:12)

## A Side-by-Side Comparison

The Bible itself provides the data for a direct comparison between the ceremonial and moral laws:

**Delivery:** The Ten Commandments were spoken by God's own voice to the people (Exodus 20:1; Deuteronomy 5:4). The ceremonial laws came through Moses as mediator (Leviticus 1:1; Galatians 3:19).

**Author:** The Ten Commandments were written by God's finger (Exodus 31:18). The ceremonial laws were written by Moses' hand (Deuteronomy 31:9, 24).

**Repository:** The stone tablets were placed inside the Ark (Exodus 25:16; Deuteronomy 10:5). The book of the law was placed beside the Ark (Deuteronomy 31:26).

**Character:** The moral law is called "holy, and just, and good" and "spiritual" (Romans 7:12, 14). The ceremonial system is called "carnal ordinances" (Hebrews 9:10) and "weak and unprofitable" (Hebrews 7:18).

**Duration:** The moral law "stands fast for ever and ever" (Psalm 111:7-8) and "not one jot shall pass" while heaven and earth exist (Matthew 5:18). The ceremonial ordinances were "imposed until the time of reformation" (Hebrews 9:10).

**New Testament vocabulary for what was abolished:** The words used are *dogma* (ordinances/decrees) in Ephesians 2:15 and Colossians 2:14, and *cheirographon* (handwriting) in Colossians 2:14. These words are never used for the moral law.

**New Testament vocabulary for what continues:** The commandments of God (*entole*) are affirmed in Revelation 12:17, 14:12, and 1 Corinthians 7:19. The law is established by faith (Romans 3:31) and written on hearts (Hebrews 8:10; 10:16).

These are not theological interpretations imposed on the text. They are observable differences recorded in Scripture itself, using the Bible's own words.

## The Early Church Faced This Question

The early church directly confronted the question of which laws remained binding. When Gentile converts began joining the faith, some insisted they must be circumcised and keep the ceremonial law. The apostles gathered at Jerusalem to address this:

> "Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?" (Acts 15:10)

The Holy Spirit guided them to this conclusion:

> "For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well." (Acts 15:28-29)

The apostolic council distinguished between ceremonial requirements that were not binding on Christians and moral requirements that remained necessary.

The book of Hebrews explains the shift in the priesthood:

> "For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law." (Hebrews 7:12)

The "law" that changed was the law governing the priesthood -- the ceremonial regulations about priestly succession and sacrificial duties. Christ became High Priest "not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life" (Hebrews 7:16). This represents a transition from the temporary, earthly, ceremonial system to the eternal, heavenly, spiritual reality in Christ.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

Several important points must be honestly acknowledged:

- **The Bible does not use the terms "moral law," "ceremonial law," or "civil law."** These are theological categories that organize what the Bible shows through its different treatment of the laws. The distinctions are present in the text; the labels are not.

- **The Bible does not state in one place that the entire ceremonial system is abolished while the entire moral law continues.** This comprehensive conclusion comes from assembling multiple passages that address different aspects of the law.

- **The Bible does not specify whether "sabbath days" in Colossians 2:16 refers to the weekly Sabbath or the annual ceremonial sabbaths.** The surrounding context (meat, drink, holy days, new moons) consists of ceremonial items, and the "shadow" language points to the ceremonial system, but the passage itself does not explicitly resolve this question.

- **The Bible does not explain why some Old Testament passages call ceremonial institutions "everlasting."** Circumcision is called an "everlasting covenant" (Genesis 17:13), and the Day of Atonement a "statute for ever" (Leviticus 16:34), yet the New Testament clearly shows these are no longer required. The resolution appears to be that "everlasting" in ceremonial contexts meant "for the duration of that dispensation" rather than absolute eternity, but this requires comparing multiple passages.

- **The Bible does not state which specific "commandments of God" Paul affirms in 1 Corinthians 7:19.** The verse clearly distinguishes ceremonial rites from "the commandments of God," but it does not enumerate which commandments are meant.

- **Neither position can claim the text explicitly states its complete systematic framework.** The view that the ceremonial law was fulfilled while the moral law continues is a systematization of multiple passages. The opposing view -- that all law is one indivisible unit that was entirely abolished -- must override the passages that affirm the law as holy, just, good, spiritual, established by faith, written on hearts, and kept by God's end-time people.

## Conclusion

The biblical evidence reveals a consistent pattern. The ceremonial laws were temporary, forward-pointing systems designed to illustrate spiritual truths that would be fulfilled in Christ. They were delivered through Moses as mediator, written by Moses in a book, placed beside the Ark, characterized as shadows, types, carnal ordinances, and weak and unprofitable, and explicitly declared to have time limitations -- "imposed until the time of reformation."

The moral law, by contrast, was delivered directly by God's own voice, written by God's own finger, placed inside the Ark, characterized as holy, just, good, spiritual, and perfect, and affirmed as continuing under the new covenant -- written on believers' hearts by the Holy Spirit.

The New Testament vocabulary is remarkably consistent across multiple authors. When the text identifies what was abolished, it uses words like *dogma* (ordinances), *cheirographon* (handwriting), and *dikaiomata sarkos* (carnal ordinances) -- words never applied to the moral law. When the text identifies what continues, it uses *entole* (commandments of God), calls the law holy, just, good, and spiritual, and describes it as established by faith and written on hearts.

The apostle Paul captured the distinction in a single verse: "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God." The ceremonial system pointed to Christ and found its fulfillment in Him. The moral law reveals God's unchanging character and remains the standard that defines sin and righteousness, while salvation itself comes through faith in Christ, who enables obedience through the indwelling Spirit.
