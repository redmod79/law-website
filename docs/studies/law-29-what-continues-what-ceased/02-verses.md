## A. Laws/Commandments That CONTINUE (NT Passages)

### A1. Jesus' Teaching on the Law's Continuity

**Matthew 5:17-20 (Sermon on the Mount -- law not destroyed)**
> 5:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
> 5:18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
> 5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach [them], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
> 5:20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.

*Greek: kataluo (G2647, destroy/dissolve) vs. pleroo (G4137, fulfil). Jesus denies kataluo and affirms pleroo.*

**Matthew 5:21-28 (Jesus deepens Decalogue commands)**
> 5:21 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
> 5:22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment...
> 5:27 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
> 5:28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.

*Jesus deepens commandments 6 and 7 -- not abolishing but intensifying.*

**Matthew 19:17-19 (Jesus lists "the commandments" as Decalogue)**
> 19:17 ...but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
> 19:18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
> 19:19 Honour thy father and [thy] mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

*Greek: entole (G1785) -- Jesus identifies "the commandments" as Decalogue commands (6,7,8,9,5).*

**Mark 10:19 (Parallel -- Jesus lists commandments)**
> 10:19 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.

*Greek: entole (G1785) -- same Decalogue identification.*

**Matthew 22:36-40 (Greatest commandment)**
> 22:36 Master, which [is] the great commandment in the law?
> 22:37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
> 22:38 This is the first and great commandment.
> 22:39 And the second [is] like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
> 22:40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

*Greek: entole (G1785). The two great commandments summarize the Decalogue (1-4: love God; 5-10: love neighbor).*

**Luke 16:17 (Law will not fail)**
> 16:17 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.

*Greek: nomos (G3551). Strongest possible statement of the law's permanence.*

**Luke 23:56 (Sabbath keeping after crucifixion)**
> 23:54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
> 23:55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
> 23:56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.

*Greek: entole (G1785). The women kept the Sabbath "according to the commandment" even after Christ's death.*

### A2. John's Writings on Commandment-Keeping

**John 14:15, 21, 23-24 (Love and commandments)**
> 14:15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.
> 14:21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me...
> 14:23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
> 14:24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.

*Greek: entole (G1785). Jesus links love to commandment-keeping.*

**1 John 2:3-7 (Know him = keep commandments)**
> 2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
> 2:4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
> 2:5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.
> 2:6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
> 2:7 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning.

*Greek: entole (G1785). John identifies these as "old" commandments "from the beginning."*

**1 John 3:4 (Sin = law-transgression)**
> 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.

*Greek: anomia (G458, lawlessness). Sin is defined by the continuing law.*

**1 John 5:2-3 (Love of God = keeping commandments)**
> 5:2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.
> 5:3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.

*Greek: entole (G1785). Commandments are ongoing and "not grievous."*

### A3. Paul on the Continuing Law

**Romans 2:14-15 (Law written on hearts of Gentiles)**
> 2:14 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
> 2:15 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and [their] thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;

*Greek: nomos (G3551). Universal moral law known even to Gentiles.*

**Romans 3:31 (Law established through faith)**
> 3:31 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.

*Greek: nomos (G3551) + katargeo (G2673, make void) denied + histemi (G2476, establish) affirmed.*

**Romans 7:7, 12, 14 (Law identified as Decalogue; holy, just, good, spiritual)**
> 7:7 What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
> 7:12 Wherefore the law [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
> 7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.

*Greek: nomos (G3551) + entole (G1785). Paul identifies "the law" by quoting the 10th commandment, then calls it holy, just, good, spiritual.*

**Romans 8:4 (Righteousness of the law fulfilled in us)**
> 8:4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

*Greek: to dikaioma (G1345, singular articular) tou nomou (G3551). "THE righteous requirement of THE law" fulfilled in Spirit-led believers.*

**Romans 8:7 (Carnal mind not subject to law)**
> 8:7 Because the carnal mind [is] enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.

*Greek: nomos tou theou (G3551). The law of God remains the standard.*

**Romans 13:8-10 (Love fulfills the law; lists Decalogue commands)**
> 13:8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
> 13:9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if [there be] any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
> 13:10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law.

*Greek: entole (G1785) + nomos (G3551). Lists commands 7,6,8,9,10 as the content love fulfills.*

**1 Corinthians 7:19 (Commandments of God distinguished from circumcision)**
> 7:18 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
> 7:19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.

*Greek: teresis entolon theou (G5084 + [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} + G2316). Paul explicitly distinguishes entole (moral commandments) from peritome (circumcision, ceremonial).*

**Ephesians 6:2 (5th commandment cited as first with promise)**
> 6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
> 6:2 Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)
> 6:3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.

*Greek: entole (G1785). Paul cites the 5th commandment as still operative.*

**1 Timothy 1:5, 8-10 (Law is good; lists Decalogue sins)**
> 1:5 Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned:
> 1:8 But we know that the law [is] good, if a man use it lawfully;
> 1:9 Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
> 1:10 For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;

*Greek: nomos (G3551). The sin list parallels the Decalogue: murderers (6th), whoremongers (7th), menstealers (8th), liars/perjured (9th).*

### A4. James on the Law

**James 1:25 (Perfect law of liberty)**
> 1:25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth [therein], he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

*Greek: nomos teleion ton tes eleutherias (G3551 + [G5046](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5046/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} + G1657). The law is called "perfect" and "of liberty."*

**James 2:8-12 (Royal law / law of liberty = Decalogue)**
> 2:8 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
> 2:9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
> 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.
> 2:11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
> 2:12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.

*Greek: nomos basilikon (G3551 + [G937](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g937/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, royal law) + nomos eleutherias (law of liberty). James identifies the content as the 7th and 6th commandments.*

### A5. Revelation -- End-Time Commandment-Keeping

**Revelation 12:17 (Remnant keep commandments of God)**
> 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

*Greek: tas entolas tou theou (G1785). End-time remnant identified by commandment-keeping.*

**Revelation 14:12 (Saints keep commandments and faith)**
> 14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here [are] they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

*Greek: tas entolas tou theou (G1785) + ten pistin Iesou (G4102). Commandments + faith = twin markers of saints.*

**Revelation 22:14 (Blessed are commandment-keepers)**
> 22:14 Blessed [are] they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.

*Greek: tas entolas autou (G1785). Commandment-keeping linked to eternal life.*

### A6. New Covenant -- Law Written on Hearts

**Hebrews 8:10 (God's laws written on hearts)**
> 8:10 For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:

*Greek: nomous mou (G3551, "my laws," anarthrous with possessive). God's laws survive covenant change.*

**Hebrews 10:16 (Repeated -- laws on hearts)**
> 10:16 This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;

*Greek: nomous mou (G3551). Bracket structure: this quotation of Jer 31:33 closes the argument opened by 8:10.*

## B. Laws/Ordinances That CEASED (NT Passages)

### B1. Colossians 2:14-17, 20-23 (Handwriting of ordinances nailed to cross)

> 2:14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
> 2:15 [And] having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
> 2:16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath [days]:
> 2:17 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body [is] of Christ.
> 2:20 Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,
> 2:21 (Touch not; taste not; handle not;
> 2:22 Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?
> 2:23 Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.

*Greek: cheirographon (G5498, "hand-written document") + tois dogmasin (G1378, dative plural, "the ordinances"). Content identified in vv.16-17: meat, drink, holyday, new moon, sabbath days = "shadow." Dogmatizo (G1379) in v.20: "subject to ordinances" = Touch not, taste not, handle not = dietary/purity regulations = "commandments and doctrines of men" (v.22).*

### B2. Ephesians 2:15 (Law of commandments in ordinances abolished)

> 2:14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition [between us];
> 2:15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, [even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, [so] making peace;
> 2:16 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:

*Greek: ton nomon (G3551) ton entolon (G1785) en dogmasin (G1378) katargesas (G2673). Progressive narrowing: the law > of the commandments > in ordinances. Katargeo = abolished/rendered idle. The en dogmasin qualifier identifies which part of the law was abolished.*

### B3. Hebrews 7:12, 16, 18 (Priesthood changed = law changed)

> 7:11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
> 7:12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
> 7:16 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.
> 7:18 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
> 7:19 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did]; by the which we draw nigh unto God.

*Greek: hierosyne (G2420, priesthood) + metatithemi (G3346, changed/transferred) + nomos (G3551) + entoles sarkines (G1785 + [G4560](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4560/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, "carnal commandment") + athetesis (G115, disannulling). The law that changed is specifically the priesthood succession law. "Carnal commandment" (entole + sarkines qualifier) identifies it as ceremonial.*

### B4. Hebrews 9:1, 8-10 (Ordinances of divine service; carnal ordinances)

> 9:1 Then verily the first [covenant] had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
> 9:8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:
> 9:9 Which [was] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
> 9:10 [Which stood] only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed [on them] until the time of reformation.

*Greek: dikaiomata latreias (G1345 + [G2999](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2999/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, "ordinances of divine service") in v.1; dikaiomata sarkos (G1345 + [G4561](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4561/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, "carnal ordinances") in v.10. Dikaioma plural + modifier = ceremonial. Content: meats, drinks, washings. Temporal: "until the time of reformation" (diorthosis, G1357).*

### B5. Hebrews 10:1-18 (Shadow law; sacrifices taken away)

> 10:1 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
> 10:4 For [it is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
> 10:5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:
> 10:8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and [offering] for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure [therein]; which are offered by the law;
> 10:9 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
> 10:14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
> 10:18 Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for sin.

*Greek: skia (G4639, shadow) in v.1. Content identified: "those sacrifices" (v.1), "sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings" (v.8). "The first" taken away = sacrificial system; "the second" established = God's will (v.9).*

### B6. 2 Corinthians 3:7-11, 13 (Glory/ministry done away)

> 3:7 But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away:
> 3:8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
> 3:9 For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
> 3:11 For if that which is done away [was] glorious, much more that which remaineth [is] glorious.
> 3:13 And not as Moses, [which] put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:

*Greek: katargeo (G2673). The grammatical subject of katargoumenen (acc sg fem participle) is ten doxan (acc sg fem, "the glory"), NOT the law. What was "done away" is the glory/ministry, not the commandments themselves. The ministration of death (he diakonia tou thanatou) transitions to the ministration of the spirit (he diakonia tou pneumatos).*

### B7. Galatians 3:13 (Redeemed from the curse of the law)

> 3:13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that hangeth on a tree:

*Greek: kataras tou nomou (G2671 + [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, "the curse of the law"). What is removed is the curse, not the law itself.*

**Galatians 3:19, 24-25 (Law as schoolmaster)**
> 3:19 Wherefore then [serveth] the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come...
> 3:24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
> 3:25 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

*Greek: paidagogos (G3807, "schoolmaster/tutor"). The law's tutelary function ceases; the standard itself is established (Rom 3:31).*

### B8. Galatians 5:2-6; 6:12-15 (Circumcision profits nothing)

> 5:2 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
> 5:3 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
> 5:6 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
> 6:12 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised...
> 6:15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

*Greek: peritome (G4061, circumcision). Specific ceremonial rite declared "nothing."*

### B9. Acts 15:1-29 (Jerusalem Council)

> 15:1 And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, [and said], Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
> 15:5 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command [them] to keep the law of Moses.
> 15:10 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
> 15:20 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and [from] fornication, and [from] things strangled, and [from] blood.
> 15:28 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;
> 15:29 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well.

*Greek: dogma (G1378) used in 16:4 for the Council decisions. Circumcision and "the law of Moses" (as soteriological requirement) rejected; four moral/dietary requirements retained: idol pollutions, fornication, things strangled, blood.*

### B10. Romans 14:1-6, 14, 17 (Meat, drink, days)

> 14:1 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, [but] not to doubtful disputations.
> 14:2 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.
> 14:5 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day [alike]. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
> 14:6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth [it] unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard [it].
> 14:14 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that [there is] nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him [it is] unclean.
> 14:17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

*Greek: koinos (G2839, "common/unclean") in v.14. Note: Paul uses koinos, not akathartos (G169, "ritually unclean" in Levitical sense). The context addresses vegetarianism (v.2) and day-esteeming, not Levitical clean/unclean categories per se.*

### B11. 1 Timothy 4:1-5 (Forbidding meats -- doctrines of devils)

> 4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;
> 4:3 Forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.
> 4:4 For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:
> 4:5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

*Greek: broma (G1033, "food/meat"). "Sanctified by the word of God" (v.5) -- the word of God is the standard for what is food. Prior studies (comprehensive-dietary-laws, biblical-diet-romans14-timothy) analyzed whether this abolishes Levitical clean/unclean distinctions or addresses ascetic heresies.*

---

## C. Pre-Mosaic Laws (Consistency Objection Passages)

### C1. Clean/Unclean Animals Before Moses

**Genesis 7:1-2 (Clean/unclean distinction -- Noah)**
> 7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
> 7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that [are] not clean by two, the male and his female.

*Hebrew: tahowr (H2889, "clean/pure"). This is the same vocabulary used in Leviticus for clean/unclean. The distinction exists before any Mosaic codification.*

**Genesis 8:20-21 (Noah's sacrifice of clean animals)**
> 8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
> 8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour...

*Hebrew: tahowr (H2889). Noah offered specifically clean animals -- the distinction was functional, not merely nominal.*

### C2. Tithing Before Moses

**Genesis 14:18-20 (Abraham tithes to Melchizedek)**
> 14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he [was] the priest of the most high God.
> 14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed [be] Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
> 14:20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

*Hebrew: ma`aser (H4643, "tithe/tenth"). Pre-Mosaic, pre-Levitical tithing to a non-Levitical priest.*

**Genesis 28:20-22 (Jacob vows a tenth)**
> 28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
> 28:22 And this stone, which I have set [for] a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.

*Hebrew: `asar (H6237, "to tithe"). Another pre-Mosaic tithe.*

### C3. Abraham's Comprehensive Obedience Before Moses

**Genesis 26:3-5**
> 26:3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee...
> 26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

*Hebrew: mishmereth (H4931, "charge") + mitsvah (H4687, "commandments") + chuqqah (H2708, "statutes") + towrah (H8451, "laws"). The same vocabulary used for Sinai legislation, applied to Abraham's pre-Sinai obedience.*

### C4. Hebrews 7 -- Melchizedek, Tithing, and Priesthood Change

**Hebrews 7:1-10 (Full passage -- Melchizedek and tithes)**
> 7:1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
> 7:2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
> 7:3 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.
> 7:4 Now consider how great this man [was], unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
> 7:5 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
> 7:6 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
> 7:7 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
> 7:8 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he [receiveth them], of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
> 7:9 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.
> 7:10 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.

**Key grammatical observations for Heb 7:8:**
1. "Here" (hode) = the Levitical system. "There" (ekei) = the Melchizedek type/pattern.
2. **Present tense verbs**: lambanoousin ("receive," present active indicative) and ze ("he lives," present active indicative). The present tenses are noteworthy -- the author uses present tense for both the Levitical and Melchizedek tithes.
3. "Men that die" (apothneskontes anthropoi) = mortal Levitical priests who receive tithes.
4. "He of whom it is witnessed that he liveth" (martyroumenos hoti ze) = Melchizedek, testified to be living. The passive participle martyroumenos points to Scripture's testimony (Gen 14; Ps 110:4).
5. The men/de construction creates a contrast: mortal priests receive tithes HERE; an undying priest receives tithes THERE.

**Hebrews 7:11-12 (Priesthood changed = law changed)**
> 7:11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
> 7:12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.

*Greek: metatithemenes (G3346, present passive participle, "being transferred") tes hierosunes (G2420, priesthood). The law being changed is specifically the priesthood law (nomou, [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, anarthrous = qualitative, "a law change").*

### C5. Jesus Affirms Tithing

**Matthew 23:23 (These ought ye to have done)**
> 23:23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier [matters] of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

*Greek: apodekatoo (G586, "to pay tithes"). Jesus affirms tithing ("these ought ye to have done") while prioritizing judgment, mercy, faith.*

**Luke 11:42 (Parallel -- these ought ye to have done)**
> 11:42 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

*Greek: apodekatoo (G586). Same affirmation of tithing.*

## D. Additional Context Passages

### D1. Hebrews 8 -- New Covenant Framework

**Hebrews 8:8-13**
> 8:8 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
> 8:10 For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...
> 8:13 In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old [is] ready to vanish away.

*Greek: autous (G846, acc pl masc, "with them" = the people, not the covenant/law). Nomous mou (G3551, "my laws") written on hearts.*

### D2. Hebrews 4:4, 9 (Sabbatismos remains)

**Hebrews 4:4, 9**
> 4:4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
> 4:9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.

*Greek: sabbatismos (G4520, "a Sabbath-keeping/rest") + apoleipetai (G620, "remains"). Unique NT word sabbatismos denotes ongoing Sabbath observance.*

### D3. Colossians 2:16 -- Sabbath Days as Shadow

**Colossians 2:16-17**
> 2:16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath [days]:
> 2:17 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body [is] of Christ.

*Greek: sabbaton (G4521). The sequence "holyday...new moon...sabbath days" parallels the OT pattern of annual/monthly/weekly observances. These are called skia ("shadow"). Prior studies analyzed whether this refers to annual ceremonial sabbaths or the weekly Sabbath.*
