# Verse Analysis — Comprehensive Catalogue: What Continues, What Ceased

## Study Question
What specific laws continue and what specific laws ceased? Comprehensive compilation from every relevant NT passage with Greek vocabulary identification.

## Nature of This Study
This is a **compilation study** — it compiles and organizes findings from 28 prior studies (law-01 through law-28) into a two-column catalogue. It does not re-argue positions; it catalogues what was found. Each entry references the prior study that established it and presents the data systematically.

## Catalogue A: Laws/Commandments That Continue

### A-1. First Commandment — "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" (Exo 20:3)

| **Greek Term** | entole (G1785) in Mat 22:38 ("first and great commandment") |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (Mat 22:37-38 explicitly names love for God as the "first and great commandment") |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | Jesus explicitly identifies the love-God command as the greatest entole. 1 John 5:21 commands "keep yourselves from idols." |
| **Prior Study** | law-14 (Jesus' law teachings), law-01 (moral law) |
| **Master ID** | E042 (Mat 22:37-40) |

### A-2. Second Commandment — "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image" (Exo 20:4-6)

| **Greek Term** | eidololatreia (G1495, idolatry); eidolon (G1497, idol) |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (multiple NT passages explicitly prohibit idol worship) |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | The Jerusalem Council retained idol abstinence (Acts 15:20). Paul calls idolatry sin (1 Cor 10:7,14). Revelation warns against beast-image worship (Rev 14:9-11). |
| **Prior Study** | law-15 (Acts 15), law-28 (Revelation commandments) |
| **Master ID** | E146 (Acts 15:28-29, council retains idol abstinence) |

### A-3. Third Commandment — "Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain" (Exo 20:7)

| Field | Data |

| **Greek Term** | blasphemeo (G987, blaspheme) in Jas 2:7; Rom 2:24 |
| **Evidence Tier** | N (Jesus teaches reverence for God's name in the Lord's Prayer; Paul and James warn against blaspheming the name) |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | The principle of reverencing God's name is reaffirmed across NT authors. No NT passage permits profaning God's name. |
| **Prior Study** | law-01 (moral law), law-14 (Jesus' law teachings) |

### A-4. Fourth Commandment — "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy" (Exo 20:8-11)

| **Greek Term** | entole (G1785) in Luk 23:56 ("according to the commandment"); sabbatismos (G4520) in Heb 4:9 |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (Luk 23:56 states the women rested "according to the commandment"; Heb 4:9 states "there remaineth a sabbatismos for the people of God") |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | Luke records post-crucifixion Sabbath-keeping "according to the commandment" (entole). The author of Hebrews uses the unique word sabbatismos (Sabbath-keeping) and says it "remains." The Fourth Commandment grounds itself in creation (Exo 20:11), and Jesus declares "the sabbath was made for man" (anthropos — humanity, not Israel alone). *(Examined in depth in law-24, law-25, law-26, law-27.)* |
| **Prior Study** | law-27 (Sabbath still binding), law-13, law-24-26 |
| **Master ID** | E333 (Luk 23:56), E337 (Heb 4:9), E086 (Exo 20:8-11), E087 (Mrk 2:27) |

| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | Paul cites this specific Decalogue command as still operative for Christian households (Eph 6:1-3). Jesus cites it to the rich young ruler (Mat 19:19) and condemns the Pharisees for nullifying it (Mat 15:4-6). |
| **Prior Study** | law-08 (abolished at cross), law-14, law-01 |
| **Master ID** | E261 (Eph 6:2-3), E041 (Mat 19:17-19) |

| **Greek Term** | entole (G1785) in Mat 19:17-18 ("the commandments"); nomos (G3551) in Jas 2:11 ("the law") |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (Jesus quotes "Thou shalt not kill" and deepens it to include anger; Paul lists it as content love fulfills; James identifies it as part of "the law") |
| **Classification** | Continues |

| **Greek Term** | entole (G1785) in Mat 19:17-18; nomos (G3551) in Jas 2:11 |

| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | Jesus deepens the 7th commandment (Mat 5:27-28). Paul, James, and the author of Hebrews all reaffirm the prohibition. James names it as content of "the law of liberty" by which Christians "shall be judged" (Jas 2:11-12). |
| **Prior Study** | law-12, law-22, law-14 |

| **Greek Term** | entole (G1785) in Mat 19:17-18 |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (Jesus lists "Thou shalt not steal" among "the commandments") |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | Jesus names it among the commandments for entering life (Mat 19:18). Paul includes it in the content love fulfills (Rom 13:9). Paul also commands thieves to steal no more (Eph 4:28). |
| **Prior Study** | law-14, law-01 |

| **Evidence Tier** | E (Jesus lists "Thou shalt not bear false witness" among "the commandments") |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | Jesus names it (Mat 19:18). Paul includes it (Rom 13:9). Paul commands truthfulness (Eph 4:25; Col 3:9). Revelation excludes liars from the holy city (Rev 21:8, 27; 22:15). |

| **NT Passage(s)** | Rom 7:7; 13:9; Eph 5:3; Col 3:5; Heb 13:5 |

| **Evidence Tier** | E (Paul explicitly quotes the 10th commandment in Rom 7:7 and identifies it as "the law" that reveals sin) |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | Paul uses the 10th commandment as the exemplar of "the law" in his argument that the law is holy, just, good, and spiritual (Rom 7:7,12,14). He includes "thou shalt not covet" in the commandments love fulfills (Rom 13:9). |
| **Prior Study** | law-16 (Paul and law in Romans), law-01 |
| **Master ID** | E010 (Rom 7:12,7), E046 (Rom 7:7), E028 (Rom 13:8-10) |

| **Evidence Tier** | E (Jesus explicitly names this as the second commandment; James calls it "the royal law") |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Prior Study** | law-14, law-22 |
| **Master ID** | E042, E460 |

### A-13. "The Law" Affirmed as Holy, Just, Good, Spiritual (General)

| **Evidence Tier** | E (Paul directly states the law is holy, the commandment holy, just, and good; the law is spiritual) |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Prior Study** | law-01, law-16 |
| **Master ID** | E010 (Rom 7:12,7), E011 (Rom 7:14) |

### A-14. The Law Established by Faith

| **NT Passage(s)** | Rom 3:31 |
| **Greek Term** | nomos (G3551) + histemi (G2476, establish) — katargeo (G2673) explicitly denied |

| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Prior Study** | law-16, law-01 |
| **Master ID** | E025 (Rom 3:31) |

| **Evidence Tier** | E (God declares "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts") |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | The new covenant does not abolish the law but changes the medium: from stone to heart. The possessive "my" indicates these are God's own laws, not a new set. |
| **Prior Study** | law-10 (new covenant and law), law-09, law-18 |
| **Master ID** | E038 (Jer 31:33), E039 (Heb 8:10; 10:16) |

| **Greek Term** | teresis entolon theou (G5084 + [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} + [G2316](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2316/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, "keeping the commandments of God") vs. peritome (G4061, circumcision) |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (Paul explicitly states "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God") |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | Paul distinguishes moral commandments (entole) from ceremonial rites (circumcision). The moral commandments remain binding; circumcision does not. This is a direct textual distinction between categories of law. |
| **Prior Study** | law-04, law-20, law-21 |
| **Master ID** | E143 (1 Cor 7:19) |

### A-17. The Perfect Law of Liberty (Jas 1:25; 2:8-12)

| **Evidence Tier** | E (James identifies the content as the 6th and 7th commandments: "Do not commit adultery...Do not kill" — Jas 2:11) |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | James calls the law "perfect" and "of liberty," then identifies its content as the Decalogue. Christians "shall be judged by the law of liberty" (Jas 2:12). |
| **Prior Study** | law-22, law-01 |
| **Master ID** | E029 (Jas 1:25; 2:10-12), E460 (Jas 2:8-12) |

| **NT Passage(s)** | 1 Jhn 3:4; Rom 3:20; 7:7 |
| **Greek Term** | anomia (G458, lawlessness); nomos (G3551) |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (John states "sin is the transgression of the law"; Paul states "by the law is the knowledge of sin") |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | If sin is defined as law-transgression, then the law must continue to exist as the operative standard. A non-existent law cannot define sin. |
| **Prior Study** | law-01, law-23 |
| **Master ID** | E023 (1 Jhn 3:4), E024 (Rom 3:20) |

### A-19. Love Defined as Commandment-Keeping (1 Jhn 5:3; Jhn 14:15)

| **Greek Term** | entole (G1785) |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (John states "this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments"; Jesus states "if ye love me, keep my commandments") |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Prior Study** | law-14, law-23, law-28 |
| **Master ID** | E030 (1 Jhn 5:3), E295 (1 Jhn 2:3-4), E350 (Jhn 14:15), E293 (Jhn 15:10) |

### A-20. The Law is Good if Used Lawfully (1 Ti 1:5,8-10)

| **NT Passage(s)** | 1 Ti 1:5,8-10 |
| **Greek Term** | nomos (G3551) |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (Paul states "the law is good if a man use it lawfully" and lists sins corresponding to commandments 6,7,8,9) |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | Paul's sin list (murderers, whoremongers, menstealers, liars, perjured persons) directly parallels commandments 6,7,8,9. He affirms the law is "good" when used lawfully. |
| **Prior Study** | law-01 |
| **Master ID** | E047 (1 Ti 1:8) |

### A-21. Commandments of God in Revelation (End-Time)

| **Greek Term** | tas entolas tou theou (G1785) in all three passages |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (Revelation identifies end-time saints by their commandment-keeping: "keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus") |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | The same Greek term (entole, unqualified) used in the rest of the NT for the Decalogue is used here for end-time commandment-keeping. Entole without qualifier = moral/Decalogue content (N097). |
| **Prior Study** | law-28 (Revelation commandments) |

|-------|------|
| **Specific Law** | "The righteousness of the law" (to dikaioma tou nomou) |
| **NT Passage(s)** | Rom 8:4 |
| **Greek Term** | dikaioma (G1345, singular articular) + nomos (G3551) |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (Paul states the purpose of God sending His Son was "that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit") |
| **Classification** | Continues |
| **Reasoning** | Dikaioma singular articular = moral standard (per vocabulary pattern). The law's righteous requirement is fulfilled IN believers (not removed from them) by Spirit-empowered obedience. |
| **Prior Study** | law-16, law-10, law-21 |

| **Greek Term** | kataluo (G2647, denied); pleroo (G4137, affirmed); nomos (G3551); entole (G1785) |

| **Greek Term** | thusia (G2378, sacrifice); prosphora (G4376, offering); skia (G4639, shadow) |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (Heb 10:4: "It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins"; Heb 10:18: "no more offering for sin") |
| **Classification** | Neutral (common ground — both positions agree sacrifices ceased) |
| **Prior Study** | law-04 (ceremonial laws), law-08, law-18 |
| **Master ID** | E132 (Heb 10:4), E154 (Heb 10:18), E056 (Heb 10:1), E133 (Heb 10:9) |

| **Evidence Tier** | E (Heb 7:12: "the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law"; Heb 7:16: "not after the law of a carnal commandment") |
| **Classification** | Neutral (ceremonial law cessation — common ground) |
| **Reasoning** | The "law" that changed is specifically the priesthood succession law, identified by the qualifier "carnal commandment" (entoles sarkines). The Melchizedek priesthood replaces the Levitical. |
| **Prior Study** | law-04, law-08, law-18 |
| **Master ID** | E151 (Heb 7:12), E152 (Heb 7:16), E153 (Heb 7:18-19), E253 (Heb 7:16,18) |

|-------|------|
| **Specific Law** | Annual appointed times (Lev 23:4-44 feasts), monthly observances |
| **NT Passage(s)** | Col 2:16-17 |
| **Greek Term** | heorte (G1859, holyday); neomenia (G3561, new moon); sabbaton (G4521, sabbath days); skia (G4639, shadow) |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (Col 2:16-17: "Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow") |
| **Classification** | Neutral (ceremonial law cessation — common ground). The "holyday...new moon...sabbath days" sequence matches the OT annual/monthly/weekly pattern of ceremonial observances. *(The question of whether this includes the weekly Sabbath is examined in depth in law-24, law-25, law-26, law-27.)* |

| **NT Passage(s)** | Col 2:14 |
| **Greek Term** | cheirographon (G5498, hand-written document) + dogma (G1378, ordinances) |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (Col 2:14: "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances...nailing it to his cross") |
| **Classification** | Neutral (the text states the cheirographon was removed; its identification as ceremonial is established by the Greek vocabulary — dogma is never used for the Decalogue [N-tier, 0/5 occurrences]) |
| **Reasoning** | Cheirographon = "hand-written" (contrasted with God-written Decalogue). Dogma = never the Decalogue. Content identified in vv.16-17 as meats, drinks, holydays, new moons, sabbath days. |

| **Evidence Tier** | E (2 Cor 3:7,11: the "glory" of the ministration is what is "done away" — the grammatical subject of katargoumenen is ten doxan, not the law) |
| **Classification** | Neutral (what is "done away" is the glory/ministry, not the commandments themselves. The "ministration of condemnation" transitions to the "ministration of righteousness" — the standard remains, the administration changes.) |

| **Greek Term** | paidagogos (G3807, tutor/schoolmaster); nomos (G3551) |
| **Evidence Tier** | E (Gal 3:24-25: "The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ...after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster") |
| **Classification** | Neutral (the tutelary function ceases; the standard itself is established — Rom 3:31. The pedagogical role of the law in leading to Christ is complete; the law as a moral standard continues.) |

## Consistency Objection Analysis

### Issue 1: Clean/Unclean Food Distinctions

**The objection:** If ceremonial laws ceased, why do some maintain the clean/unclean food distinction?

**Pre-Mosaic basis:**
- Gen 7:2 — God instructed Noah to distinguish "clean" (tahowr, H2889) and "not clean" animals. This is the same vocabulary used in Levitical regulations, but it predates Sinai by centuries. (Master ID: E070)
- Gen 8:20 — Noah offered specifically clean animals as burnt offerings, showing the distinction was functional and known. (Master ID: E071)

**NT evidence examined in prior studies:**
1. **Mark 7:14-23** — Jesus declares "there is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him." Prior analysis (comprehensive-dietary-laws) found the context is about unwashed hands and Pharisaic tradition, not Levitical food categories. Jesus says "purging all meats" (katharizōn panta ta brōmata) — but the foods in view are those already classified as food (brōma), not the reclassification of unclean animals as food.

2. **Acts 10:9-16** — Peter's vision of unclean animals with the command "kill, and eat." Peter's own interpretation: "God hath shewed me that I should not call any MAN common or unclean" (Acts 10:28). Peter applies the vision to people (Gentiles), not to food.

3. **Romans 14:1-23** — Paul uses koinos (G2839, "common") in v.14, NOT akathartos (G169, "ritually unclean" in the Levitical sense). The context addresses vegetarianism (v.2: "eateth herbs") and day-esteeming, not Levitical clean/unclean categories. *(Examined in depth in biblical-diet-romans14-timothy.)*

4. **1 Timothy 4:1-5** — Paul warns against "forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats [broma]." The phrase "sanctified by the word of God" (v.5) points back to what the Word of God identifies as food. *(Examined in depth in biblical-diet-romans14-timothy.)*

5. **Colossians 2:16** — "Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink." The context is the cheirographon tois dogmasin (v.14), which is classified as ceremonial ordinances by its Greek vocabulary.

**Classification reasoning:** The clean/unclean animal distinction pre-dates the Mosaic codification (Gen 7:2), uses the same Hebrew vocabulary (tahowr), and is not explicitly abrogated in the NT. The passages cited as abolishing it address different issues (unwashed hands, Gentile inclusion, vegetarianism vs. meat-eating, ascetic heresies). The pre-Mosaic basis places this distinction alongside tithing, Sabbath, and murder prohibition as a standard that precedes and survives the Mosaic system. This is an I-A inference (systematizes E items from multiple passages) favoring Continues.

### Issue 2: Tithing

**The objection:** If the Levitical system ceased, why does tithing continue?

**Pre-Mosaic basis:**
- Gen 14:18-20 — Abraham paid tithes (ma`aser, H4643) to Melchizedek, "priest of the most high God." This predates the Levitical system by centuries. (Master ID reference: E070 vicinity — established in law-02)
- Gen 28:22 — Jacob vowed a tenth (`asar, H6237) to God.

**Hebrews 7:1-10 analysis:**
The author of Hebrews uses the Abraham-Melchizedek tithe event to establish the superiority of the Melchizedek priesthood over the Levitical. Key observations:

1. **Heb 7:5** — "They that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment [entole] to take tithes of the people according to the law." This identifies a Levitical entole for tithing.

2. **Heb 7:6** — "But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham." Melchizedek's authority to receive tithes is not derived from the Levitical law.

3. **Heb 7:8** — "And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth."

**Greek analysis of Heb 7:8:**
- hōde men ("here, on the one hand") = the Levitical system
- ekei de ("there, on the other hand") = the Melchizedek type/pattern
- lambanosin (present active indicative, "receive") — present tense for both
- apothnēskontes anthrōpoi ("dying men") = mortal Levitical priests
- martyroumenos hoti zē ("being witnessed that he lives") = Melchizedek, testified in Scripture as living

The men...de construction creates a contrast: mortal priests receive tithes HERE; an undying priest receives them THERE. The present tenses are noteworthy. The author presents tithing as occurring in both systems — Levitical and Melchizedek — with the Melchizedek tithe being superior because the priest "liveth."

4. **Heb 7:9-10** — Levi himself "paid tithes in Abraham" to Melchizedek, establishing Melchizedek's superiority.

5. **Mat 23:23 / Luk 11:42** — Jesus explicitly affirms tithing: "these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone." The Greek apodekatoo (G586, "to pay tithes") with edei (G1163, "it is necessary/ought") makes this a direct statement of obligation.

**Classification reasoning:**
- Tithing predates the Mosaic system (Gen 14:20 — Abraham to Melchizedek).
- Hebrews 7:1-10 uses the Abraham-Melchizedek tithe to argue for Melchizedek priesthood superiority, implying the tithe principle transcends the Levitical system.
- Heb 7:8 presents tithing as active in both systems with present tense verbs.
- Jesus directly affirms tithing obligation (Mat 23:23).
- The Levitical administration of tithing has changed (Levitical priesthood changed — Heb 7:12), but the principle of the tithe predates and is not limited to the Levitical system.
- Classification: I-A (Continues) — systematizes E items (Gen 14:20 pre-Mosaic tithe + Heb 7:8 present tense + Mat 23:23 affirmation) into the conclusion that tithing continues under the Melchizedek priesthood.

### Issue 3: Whether Pre-Mosaic Origin Affects Classification

The pre-Mosaic evidence (documented in law-02) shows that multiple laws/standards existed before Sinai:
- Sabbath: Gen 2:2-3 (creation)
- Murder prohibition: Gen 4:8-12; 9:5-6
- Marriage/adultery standard: Gen 2:24; 20:3; 39:9
- Clean/unclean distinction: Gen 7:2
- Tithing: Gen 14:20
- Comprehensive law-keeping: Gen 26:5 (Abraham kept commandments, statutes, laws)

These pre-Mosaic origins demonstrate that the standards in question are not uniquely Mosaic — they precede and therefore survive the Mosaic system's specific administration. When the Mosaic system's ceremonial provisions are removed (Heb 7:12; 9:10), standards that existed before Moses are not automatically removed with it. This is N-tier evidence: if a law existed before the Mosaic system was established, the removal of the Mosaic system does not logically entail the removal of that law.

## Vocabulary Distribution Pattern

The strongest tool-verified finding across the series (law-20, law-21) is the vocabulary partition:

| Vocabulary | Used in Affirmation Passages | Used in Abolition Passages | Partition |
|---|---|---|---|
| entole (G1785) unqualified | 43/43 identifiable = moral/Decalogue | 0/43 | Clean |
| entole + qualifier (sarkines, en dogmasin, anthropon) | 0 | All ceremonial uses carry qualifier | Clean |
| dogma (G1378) | 0/5 = never moral | 2/5 = ceremonial abolished | Clean |
| cheirographon (G5498) | 0/1 | 1/1 (Col 2:14) | Clean |
| dikaioma singular articular | moral standard (Rom 8:4) | 0 | Clean |
| dikaioma plural + modifier | 0 | ceremonial (Heb 9:1,10) | Clean |
| nomos (G3551) | Both (broadest range) | Both | NOT clean |

Four of five core NT law terms partition cleanly between affirmation and abolition contexts. The fifth (nomos) has the broadest semantic range and appears in both.

## Patterns Across the Catalogue

### Pattern 1: Every Specific Commandment Named as Continuing is from the Decalogue
When the NT identifies a specific commandment as continuing — by name or by quoting its content — it is always a Decalogue commandment. No NT passage names a specific ceremonial regulation as continuing.

### Pattern 2: Every Specific Law Named as Ceased is Ceremonial or Civil
When the NT identifies a specific law as abolished — by name or by specifying its content — it is always a ceremonial regulation (sacrifices, priesthood succession, circumcision, meats/drinks/washings, feasts, ordinances). No NT passage names a specific Decalogue command as ceased.

### Pattern 3: Vocabulary Consistently Partitions
The Greek vocabulary used in affirmation passages (entole unqualified, dikaioma singular articular) differs from the vocabulary used in abolition passages (dogma, cheirographon, dikaiomata sarkos, skia). This is an observable, tool-verified pattern across the entire NT.

### Pattern 4: Jesus Deepens but Never Abolishes the Decalogue
In the Sermon on the Mount (Mat 5), Jesus quotes commandments 6 and 7 and deepens them (extending murder to anger, adultery to lust). He does not abolish any Decalogue commandment. He directs the rich young ruler to the Decalogue. He identifies the two love commandments as summarizing "all the law."

### Pattern 5: The New Covenant Writes the Law, Not a New Law
The new covenant promise (Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10; 10:16) is not the introduction of a new law but the internalization of God's existing law: "I will put MY laws [nomous mou] into their mind, and write them in their hearts." The possessive "my" identifies these as God's own laws, not a replacement set.
