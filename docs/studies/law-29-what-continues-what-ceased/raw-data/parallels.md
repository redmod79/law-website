| Isaiah 22:16 | 0.285 | 0.45 | 0.20 | "here, place" |

Note: No strong OT parallel found -- this is expected since Heb 7:8 is a unique NT theological statement about Melchizedek and tithing. The closest conceptual OT connection is Genesis 14:18-20 (the event being discussed) and Psalm 110:4 (the Melchizedek priesthood prophecy), which the hybrid tool did not rank highly due to different vocabulary.

| Mark 14:34 | 0.339 | 0.62 | 0.10 | "here" |

| Hebrews 2:6 | 0.315 | 0.50 | 0.20 | "however, testifi-" |

Note: Heb 9:15 is the most conceptually relevant NT parallel -- Christ as mediator of the new testament, which connects to the Melchizedek priesthood argument. Hebrews 2:6 shares "witnessed/testified" vocabulary.
