### law-08: What Was Abolished at the Cross?
**Question:** Which specific laws were abolished at the cross and which remain?
**Key Finding:** The 7 primary NT abolition passages (Col 2:14-17, Eph 2:15, Heb 7:12, Heb 9:10, Heb 10:1-9, 2 Cor 3:7-11, Gal 3:13) each identify something different as abolished -- and NONE names the Decalogue as the thing abolished. Greek vocabulary specifies the referent in each case:
- Col 2:14: cheirographon tois dogmasin (hand-written certificate of ordinances)
- Eph 2:15: ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin (the law of commandments in ordinances)
- Heb 7:12: the priesthood law
- Heb 9:10: dikaiomata sarkos (carnal ordinances -- meats, drinks, washings)
- Heb 10:1-9: thusia kai prosphora (sacrifice and offering)
- 2 Cor 3:7: ten doxan (the glory) -- grammatical subject is glory, not law
- Gal 3:13: kataras tou nomou (the curse of the law)

### law-20: NT Greek Law Vocabulary
**Question:** What do entole, nomos, dogma, cheirographon, and dikaioma reveal about law categories?
**Key Findings:**
- E-items: 32 explicit statements documenting vocabulary distribution
- N1: entole without qualifier never = abolished ceremonial (43/43 moral)
- N2: dogma never = moral (0/5 occurrences)
- N3: cheirographon = "hand-written" vs. Decalogue = "written with finger of God"
- I1 (I-A): Vocabulary encodes systematic moral/ceremonial distinction
- I2 (I-A): Abolition passages abolish only ceremonial law
- I3 (I-D): "All NT law = interchangeable" claim overrides N1, N2
- I4 (I-D): "Cheirographon = Decalogue" claim overrides N3

### law-21: NT Vocab Law Categories -- Systematic Mapping
**Question:** How does NT vocabulary distinguish moral, ceremonial, and civil law?
**Key Findings:**
- Confirmed law-20 data with content-identification layer
- 33 E-items, 7 N-items, 7 I-items
- Affirmation vocabulary: entole (unqualified), dikaioma (singular articular), nomos (holy/just/good)
- Abolition vocabulary: dogma, dogmatizo, cheirographon, dikaioma (plural+modifier), skia
- 4 of 5 core terms partition cleanly; nomos has broadest range
- Nomos article pattern NOT reliable categorical marker (I-B resolved against)
- Dikaioma singular/plural = contextual pattern, not absolute code (I-B resolved against)
