# Bible Study: What Specific Laws Continue and What Specific Laws Ceased? — A Comprehensive NT Catalogue

## Question
What specific laws continue and what specific laws ceased? Produce a comprehensive, systematic compilation from every relevant NT passage. Create a two-column catalogue: (1) Laws/commandments the NT explicitly states or necessarily implies continue — with the NT passage and Greek vocabulary identification for each, and (2) Laws/ordinances the NT explicitly states or necessarily implies ceased — with the NT passage and Greek vocabulary identification for each. For each item, identify the specific law by name/content (not just "the law"), cite the NT passage that addresses it, note the Greek term used (entole, nomos, dogma, dikaioma, etc.), and classify by evidence tier (E, N, or I). Specifically address the consistency objection: if the ceremonial law is abolished, what is the biblical basis for continuing clean/unclean food distinctions and tithing? Note that both pre-date the Mosaic system — clean/unclean animals in Genesis 7:2 (Noah), tithing in Genesis 14:20 (Abraham to Melchizedek) — and examine whether Hebrews 7:8 indicates tithing continues under the Melchizedek priesthood. This study compiles and organizes — it does not re-argue. Draw from all 28 prior studies.

**Key findings from prior study conclusions (law-20, law-21, law-08):**

1. **Vocabulary distribution is the strongest tool-verified indicator.** Entole (G1785) without qualifier = moral/Decalogue content (43/43 occurrences). Dogma (G1378) = never moral (0/5 occurrences). Cheirographon (G5498) = hand-written, contrasted with God-written Decalogue. These distributions are N-tier (necessary implications from complete enumeration).

2. **No NT abolition passage names the Decalogue.** All 7 primary abolition passages (Col 2:14-17, Eph 2:15, Heb 7:12, Heb 9:10, Heb 10:1-9, 2 Cor 3:7-11, Gal 3:13) identify specific content via Greek vocabulary, and none identifies the Ten Commandments. The content identified includes: dogma/ordinances, priesthood succession law, dikaiomata sarkos (carnal ordinances = meats, drinks, washings), sacrifice and offering, the glory/ministry, the curse of the law.

3. **Pre-Mosaic evidence for clean/unclean and tithing was documented in law-02.** Genesis 7:2 uses tahowr (H2889) — standard Levitical vocabulary — before Sinai. Genesis 14:20 records Abraham's tithe to Melchizedek. These pre-date the Mosaic code.

4. **The NT vocabulary partitions cleanly.** Affirmation passages use entole (unqualified), dikaioma (singular articular), nomos (described as holy/just/good/spiritual). Abolition passages use dogma, dogmatizo, cheirographon, dikaioma (plural + modifier), skia. Four of five core terms partition cleanly.

### Study DB Key Findings

**From study_db.py search "what continues what ceased moral ceremonial":**
- law-10 found that new covenant texts simultaneously remove ceremonial provisions while affirming moral continuity (Pattern 5)
- law-04 established that the NT uses specific vocabulary for what was abolished: dogma for abolition, entole for moral commands
- law-01 resolved I-B tension on cessation passages: E53 (Eph 2:15 uses dogma, not nomos/entole), E54 (Col 2:14 uses dogma)
- law-08 found no passage explicitly names the Decalogue as abolished (Pattern 4)

**From study_db.py search "tithing clean unclean food pre-Mosaic":**
- law-02 analyzed Gen 7:2 (tahowr = clean) — pre-Sinai moral vocabulary
- law-02 analyzed Gen 14:18-20 (tithe to Melchizedek) — pre-Mosaic tithing
- law-09 analyzed Heb 9:1-10 (first covenant ordinances = meats, drinks, washings)

**From study_db.py find-word "entole", "nomos", "dogma":**
- Extensive prior analysis across law-01, law-04, law-08, law-20, law-21, law-22, law-23, law-28 and others
- The vocabulary data is well-established across the series

**From study_db.py find-passage "Heb 7:8":**
- No prior study has specifically analyzed Heb 7:8 in the context of ongoing tithing under the Melchizedek priesthood. This is a gap to fill.

### Focus Areas

These focus areas are derived from tool discoveries and study DB results:

1. **Two-column catalogue construction.** Compile every NT passage that identifies a specific law/commandment as continuing or ceased. For each entry: name the specific law, cite the NT passage, identify the Greek term, and assign evidence tier (E, N, or I).

2. **Greek vocabulary identification for every entry.** Each catalogue item must note which Greek term is used (entole, nomos, dogma, dikaioma, cheirographon, dogmatizo, katargeo, etc.) and how that term's NT distribution pattern informs the classification.

3. **Laws that continue — systematic compilation from all 28 prior studies.** Draw from law-01 through law-28 to produce the comprehensive list. Key sources: law-01 (moral law), law-12 (Mat 5:17-20), law-14 (Jesus' law teachings), law-16 (Paul in Romans), law-22 (James and the law), law-28 (Revelation commandments), plus all individual commandment studies.

4. **Laws that ceased — systematic compilation from all 28 prior studies.** Draw from law-04 (ceremonial), law-05 (civil judicial), law-08 (abolished at cross), law-15 (Acts 15), law-17 (Galatians), law-18 (Hebrews 8-10), law-19 (2 Cor 3), law-24-26 (sabbath shadow passages).

5. **The consistency objection: clean/unclean food distinctions.**
   - Gen 7:2 establishes clean/unclean distinction pre-Mosaic (tahowr, H2889)
   - Prior studies: comprehensive-dietary-laws, biblical-diet-romans14-timothy
   - Key NT passages: Mark 7:14-23; Acts 10:9-16; Rom 14:1-23; 1 Tim 4:1-5; Col 2:16
   - Question: Do these passages abolish the clean/unclean food distinction, or do they address something else?

6. **The consistency objection: tithing.**
   - Gen 14:20 establishes tithing pre-Mosaic (Abraham to Melchizedek)
   - Gen 28:22 (Jacob's vow of a tenth)
   - Heb 7:2-9 (Melchizedek's priesthood and tithing)
   - **Heb 7:8 specifically** — "here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth" — Does this indicate tithing continues under the Melchizedek priesthood? This is a gap in prior studies.
   - Mat 23:23; Luk 11:42 (Jesus affirms tithing: "these ought ye to have done")

7. **Evidence tier classification.** Every catalogue entry must be classified:
   - **E (Explicit):** The NT passage directly names the specific law and states it continues/ceased
   - **N (Necessary Implication):** The NT passage necessarily implies the specific law continues/ceased when combined with other E-statements
   - **I (Inference):** Classification requires adding a concept, choosing between readings, or systematizing beyond what the text directly states

8. **Compilation, not re-argumentation.** This study organizes and catalogues findings from 28 prior studies. It does not re-argue positions. Each entry should reference the prior study that established it and present the data systematically.
