## Core Greek Law Terms

### entole (G1785) -- ἐντολή -- "commandment"
**Transliteration:** entole
**Pronunciation:** en-tol-ay
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**NT Occurrences:** 71

**Definition:** Injunction; an authoritative prescription/commandment.

**Distribution Pattern (from law-20, law-21):**
- **Without qualifier = moral/Decalogue content (43/43 identifiable instances)**
  - Jesus lists Decalogue commands as "the commandments [entole]" (Mat 19:17-19; Mar 10:19)
  - Paul calls the 10th commandment "the commandment [entole]" (Rom 7:12)
  - Paul lists 5 Decalogue commands under "any other commandment [entole]" (Rom 13:9)
  - Paul distinguishes "commandments [entole] of God" from circumcision (1 Cor 7:19)
  - Paul calls 5th commandment "first commandment [entole] with promise" (Eph 6:2)
  - Luke: women rested "according to the commandment [entole]" (Luk 23:56)
  - John: "keep his commandments [entole]" (1 Jhn 2:3-4; 5:3)
  - Revelation: "commandments [entole] of God" (Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14)

- **With qualifier = ceremonial/non-moral content (every ceremonial use has a modifier)**
  - entoles sarkines = "carnal commandment" -- Levitical priesthood succession (Heb 7:16)
  - en dogmasin = "in ordinances" -- abolished ceremonial ordinances (Eph 2:15)
  - anthropon = "of men" -- human traditions (Tit 1:14)

**Significance for continues/ceased catalogue:** When a NT passage uses entole without qualifier, the referent is moral/Decalogue content. This pattern holds across all NT authors (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, Hebrews author, Revelation author). N-tier evidence (complete enumeration).

### nomos (G3551) -- νόμος -- "law"
**Transliteration:** nomos
**Pronunciation:** nom-os
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**NT Occurrences:** 197

**Definition:** From nemo (to parcel out, especially food or grazing to animals); law, anything established, custom, usage.

**Senses in the NT (from law-16, law-20):**
1. **Torah/Mosaic code** (articular ho nomos): "the law" as the body of Mosaic legislation
2. **Decalogue specifically** (identified by content quotation): Rom 7:7 quotes 10th commandment
3. **Operating principle/rule** (nomos + genitive): "law of sin and death" (Rom 8:2), "law of faith" (Rom 3:27)
4. **Pentateuch as Scripture/witness** (articular): "the law and the prophets" (Mat 5:17; Rom 3:21)

**Article pattern:** The articular/anarthrous distinction is a tendency, NOT an absolute code:
- Articular ho nomos = moral content (Rom 7:7,12,14) BUT ALSO ceremonial (Gal 3:19; Heb 10:1)
- Anarthrous nomos = generic/qualitative BUT ALSO moral content (Heb 8:10; 10:16)

**Key affirmation passages:**
- "We establish the law [nomon]" (Rom 3:31)
- "The law is holy...just...good" (Rom 7:12)
- "The law is spiritual" (Rom 7:14)
- "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail" (Luk 16:17)
- "Perfect law of liberty" (Jas 1:25)

**Key cessation-context passages:**
- "A change also of the law" (Heb 7:12) -- priesthood law specifically
- "The law having a shadow" (Heb 10:1) -- sacrificial system specifically
- "The law was our schoolmaster" (Gal 3:24) -- tutelary function ceases

### dogma (G1378) -- δόγμα -- "decree/ordinance"
**Transliteration:** dogma
**Pronunciation:** dog-ma
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**NT Occurrences:** 5

**Definition:** A law (civil, ceremonial, or ecclesiastical); a public decree, ordinance.

**Complete NT distribution (all 5 occurrences):**
1. **Luke 2:1** -- "a decree from Caesar Augustus" = Roman civil decree
2. **Acts 17:7** -- "the decrees of Caesar" = Roman imperial decrees
3. **Acts 16:4** -- "the decrees ordained of the apostles" = Jerusalem Council decisions
4. **Ephesians 2:15** -- "the law of commandments in ordinances [en dogmasin]" = abolished ceremonial regulations
5. **Colossians 2:14** -- "the handwriting of ordinances [tois dogmasin]" = what was nailed to the cross

**Significance:** Dogma is **never** used for God's moral commandments (the Decalogue) in any NT passage. All 5 occurrences divide into civil decrees (2), ecclesiastical decree (1), and abolished ceremonial regulations (2). This is N-tier evidence (complete enumeration of 5 occurrences).

### dogmatizo (G1379) -- δογματίζω -- "to subject to ordinances"
**Transliteration:** dogmatizo
**Pronunciation:** dog-mat-id-zo
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**NT Occurrences:** 1

**Definition:** To prescribe by statute; to submit to ceremonial rules.

**Sole NT occurrence:** Colossians 2:20 -- "Why are ye subject to ordinances [dogmatizesthe]?" Content identified in vv.21-22: "Touch not; taste not; handle not" = dietary/purity regulations = "commandments and doctrines of men."

### dikaioma (G1345) -- δικαίωμα -- "ordinance/righteous requirement"
**Transliteration:** dikaioma
**Pronunciation:** dik-ah-yo-ma
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**NT Occurrences:** 10

**Definition:** An equitable deed; by implication, a statute or decision.

**Pattern in law-referent contexts:**
- **Singular + articular = moral standard:**
  - Rom 8:4 -- "to dikaioma tou nomou" (THE righteous requirement of THE law) -- connected to Decalogue in Rom 7:7
  - Rom 1:32 -- "to dikaioma tou theou" (God's righteous decree) -- moral, consistent
  - Rom 2:26 -- "ta dikaiomata tou nomou" (plural articular, the law's requirements) -- moral requirements kept by Gentiles

- **Plural + modifier = ceremonial ordinances:**
  - Heb 9:1 -- "dikaiomata latreias" (ordinances of divine service)
  - Heb 9:10 -- "dikaiomata sarkos" (carnal ordinances = meats, drinks, washings)

- **Non-law-referent contexts (breaks "absolute code" claim):**
  - Rev 15:4 -- plural, righteous judgments (not ceremonial)
  - Rev 19:8 -- plural, righteous deeds (not ceremonial)
  - Rom 5:16,18 -- singular, forensic act (not moral law per se)

**Note from Luke 1:6:** Luke lists entolai and dikaiomata as two distinct categories: "walking in all the commandments [entolais] and ordinances [dikaiOmasin] of the Lord blameless."

### cheirographon (G5498) -- χειρόγραφον -- "handwriting/certificate"
**Transliteration:** cheirographon
**Pronunciation:** khi-rog-raf-on
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**NT Occurrences:** 1

**Definition:** Something hand-written; a manuscript; specifically, a legal document or bond. Compound: cheir (G5495, "hand") + grapho (G1125, "write").

**Sole NT occurrence:** Colossians 2:14 -- "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances [cheirographon tois dogmasin] that was against us."

**Significance:** The etymology means "hand-written document." The Decalogue was "written with the finger of God" (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10) -- a different authorship category. Moses' book of the law was hand-written (Deu 31:24) and placed "in the side of the ark" as "a witness against thee" (Deu 31:26). The pairing with tois dogmasin (which is never used for the Decalogue) further identifies the referent as ceremonial, not moral law.

### katargeo (G2673) -- καταργέω -- "to abolish/render idle"
**Transliteration:** katargeo
**Pronunciation:** kat-arg-eh-o
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**NT Occurrences:** 27

**Definition:** From kata + argeo; to be or render entirely idle (useless); literally or figuratively: abolish, cease, destroy, do away, make of no effect, make void.

**Key occurrences in law context:**
- **Eph 2:15** -- katargesas ("having abolished") -- object is "the law of commandments in ordinances [en dogmasin]"
- **2 Cor 3:7,11,13** -- katargoumenen (acc sg fem participle) -- grammatical subject is ten doxan (the glory, acc sg fem), NOT the law
- **Rom 3:31** -- katargoumen ("do we make void") -- emphatically denied: "God forbid; we establish the law"

**Significance:** Katargeo is cessation vocabulary, but the grammatical object must be identified in each case. In Eph 2:15, the object is narrowed by en dogmasin. In 2 Cor 3:7-11, the object is the glory/ministry. In Rom 3:31, katargeo is denied regarding the law.

## Additional Key Terms

### pleroo (G4137) -- πληρόω -- "to fulfil"
**Transliteration:** pleroo
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**NT Occurrences:** 90

**Definition:** From pleres; to make replete; to cram (a net), level up (a hollow); figuratively to furnish, satisfy, execute (an office), finish, verify.

**Key law passage:** Mat 5:17 -- "I am not come to destroy [kataluo], but to fulfil [pleroo]." Jesus explicitly contrasts pleroo with kataluo. Pleroo = to fill up, give full meaning, accomplish.

### kataluo (G2647) -- καταλύω -- "to destroy/dissolve"
**Transliteration:** kataluo
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**NT Occurrences:** 17

**Definition:** From kata + luo; to loosen down (disintegrate); to demolish.

**Key passage:** Mat 5:17 -- "Think not that I am come to destroy [kataluo] the law." Jesus denies kataluo regarding the law. Same word used for destroying the temple (Mat 24:2; 26:61).

### hierosyne (G2420) -- ἱερωσύνη -- "priesthood"
**Transliteration:** hierosyne
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**NT Occurrences:** 4

**Key passages:** Heb 7:11,14 -- "If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood [hierosyne]..." The priesthood changed triggers a law change (Heb 7:12). The specific law that changes is the priesthood succession law, not the moral law.

---

## Hebrew Terms (Pre-Mosaic Evidence)

### tahowr (H2889) -- טָהוֹר -- "clean/pure"
**Transliteration:** tahowr
**Part of Speech:** Adjective
**OT Occurrences:** 94

**Definition:** Pure (in a physical, chemical, ceremonial, or moral sense): clean, fair, pure.

**Key pre-Mosaic passage:** Gen 7:2 -- "Of every clean [tahowr] beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens." This is the earliest biblical occurrence of the clean/unclean distinction. The same word is used extensively in Leviticus (11:36,37,47; etc.) -- identical vocabulary before and after Sinai.

### mitsvah (H4687) -- מִצְוָה -- "commandment"
**Hebrew equivalent of entole (G1785). Gen 26:5 -- Abraham kept God's "commandments [mitsvah]" before Sinai.**

### mishpat (H4941) -- מִשְׁפָּט -- "judgment/ordinance"
**Hebrew term for judicial regulations. Gen 18:19 -- "keep the way of the LORD, to do justice [tsedaqah] and judgment [mishpat]."**
