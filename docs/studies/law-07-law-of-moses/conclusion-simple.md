# What Does "The Law of Moses" Refer To?

## A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence

---

### Introduction

The phrase "the law of Moses" appears 21 times in the King James Bible. It is one of the most important legal designations in Scripture, and how we understand it shapes how we read dozens of passages about law, grace, and obedience. Does "the law of Moses" mean only the ceremonial regulations about sacrifices and rituals? Does it mean only the moral commandments? Or does it mean something broader?

This study examined every occurrence of the phrase, identified the specific content each passage refers to, and compared "the law of Moses" with two related phrases -- "the law of God" and "the law of the LORD" -- to determine whether these terms are synonymous or carry distinct meanings. The findings are both straightforward and surprising: "the law of Moses" refers to the entire body of legislation in the Pentateuch, these three phrases are demonstrably interchangeable in the Old Testament, and yet the New Testament shows evidence that writers like Paul may use them with more specific meanings.

## The Phrase Covers Everything

When we look at what specific content is actually identified in passages using "the law of Moses," the range is striking. The phrase covers ceremonial regulations like altar construction, burnt offerings, purification after childbirth, and circumcision. It covers civil and judicial matters like individual accountability, agricultural regulations, and witness requirements. It covers covenant curses for disobedience. And it is used as a name for the Pentateuch itself as a literary division of Scripture.

For example, in Joshua 8:31, "the law of Moses" refers to altar construction -- a ceremonial matter:

> "As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron." (Joshua 8:31)

In 1 Corinthians 9:9, Paul cites "the law of Moses" for a civil and agricultural regulation:

> "For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn." (1 Corinthians 9:9)

In Hebrews 10:28, the phrase refers to a judicial procedure:

> "He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses." (Hebrews 10:28)

In Luke 24:44, Jesus uses it as a literary designation for the first section of the Hebrew Bible:

> "All things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me." (Luke 24:44)

Notably, no occurrence of "the law of Moses" anywhere in the Bible identifies exclusively the Ten Commandments or the moral law as its referent. When the phrase is used in a broad, comprehensive way -- which happens in 7 of the 21 occurrences -- it always includes every category. God Himself expands the phrase in Malachi:

> "Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments." (Malachi 4:4)

David uses similarly comprehensive language when instructing Solomon:

> "And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses." (1 Kings 2:3)

The four terms -- statutes, commandments, judgments, and testimonies -- are a standard Old Testament formula for the full range of Mosaic legislation. When "the law of Moses" is spoken of broadly, it means the whole.

## Three Phrases for One Document

One of the most important findings is that "the law of Moses," "the law of God," and "the law of the LORD" are used interchangeably in the Old Testament to refer to the same body of legislation. This is demonstrated by passages that apply all three labels to the same physical document.

The clearest example is Nehemiah 8, where a single scroll read by Ezra receives four different names in the same chapter:

- Verse 1: "the book of the law of Moses"
- Verse 8: "the law of God"
- Verse 14: "the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses"
- Verse 18: "the book of the law of God"

These are not four different books. They are four ways of describing the same document that Ezra held in his hands.

Other passages make the relationship explicit through bridging formulas that combine the perspectives in a single statement. Nehemiah 10:29 joins both:

> "...to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God." (Nehemiah 10:29)

Second Chronicles 34:14 does the same:

> "Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses." (2 Chronicles 34:14)

In Daniel 9:11, both designations appear in one verse:

> "Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God." (Daniel 9:11)

The different phrases describe the same law from different angles. "Law of Moses" names the human mediator through whom it was delivered. "Law of God" and "law of the LORD" name the divine author whose authority stands behind it. The law has both relationships simultaneously.

God Himself confirms this in Malachi 4:4, where He says "the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb." Moses is the servant-mediator; God is the commanding source. The Hebrew verb "I commanded" is first-person singular -- God claims direct authorship while simultaneously calling it Moses' law.

## Luke's Same-Passage Interchange

Luke provides a particularly vivid example of the interchangeability. In Luke 2:22-24, describing events after Jesus' birth, Luke uses both phrases within three verses:

> "And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord; (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord." (Luke 2:22-24)

"The law of Moses" (verse 22) and "the law of the Lord" (verses 23 and 24) refer to the same ceremonial legislation in the same passage. Luke switches between the phrases without any indication that he means different things.

## A Possible Distinction in Paul's Usage

While the Old Testament uses these phrases as interchangeable names for the same comprehensive body of law, there is evidence that the apostle Paul may use them with more specific meanings.

In Romans 7, Paul identifies which law he means by quoting the tenth commandment:

> "I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." (Romans 7:7)

A few verses later, when he speaks of "the law of God," the context tells us he has the Ten Commandments specifically in mind. His language about this law is remarkably positive:

> "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man." (Romans 7:22)

> "So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin." (Romans 7:25)

> "Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." (Romans 8:7)

Paul delights in this law, serves it with his mind, and treats hostility toward it as a mark of the unregenerate mind. The law he identifies as "the law of God" -- the Ten Commandments -- is something he wholeheartedly affirms.

In contrast, when Paul uses "the law of Moses" in 1 Corinthians 9:9, the cited content is a civil and agricultural regulation from Deuteronomy 25:4 about not muzzling an ox -- not a commandment from the Decalogue.

This pattern is reinforced by vocabulary distinctions across the New Testament. The Greek word *entole* (commandment) appears in phrases like "the commandments of God" (1 Corinthians 7:19; Revelation 12:17; 14:12) but never in any "law of Moses" phrase. The Greek word *dogma* (ordinance/decree), used in passages about regulations being abolished (Colossians 2:14; Ephesians 2:15), is never connected to the Ten Commandments or moral commands.

Paul never explicitly states that he uses "law of God" for the moral law and "law of Moses" for the broader code. The distinction must be observed from the pattern of his usage. But the pattern is consistent and supported by vocabulary data across his letters.

## The "Law of the LORD" Includes Both Ceremonial and Moral Content

An important clarification: the phrase "law of the LORD" is not restricted to moral law. Scripture uses it for ceremonial content in multiple passages:

> "To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually... as it is written in the law of the LORD." (1 Chronicles 16:40)

> "According to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD." (2 Chronicles 29:25)

The "law of the LORD" covers burnt offerings, set feasts (2 Chronicles 31:3), priestly portions (2 Chronicles 31:4), and in Luke 2:23-24, firstborn presentation and sacrifice.

At the same time, the "law of the LORD" also covers moral content. In 2 Kings 10:31, Jehu's failure is described as not walking "in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart" -- a reference to idolatry, violating the first and second commandments. Amos 2:4 parallels "the law of the LORD" with "his commandments."

The phrase is comprehensive, just like "the law of Moses."

## Practices Older Than Moses

Jesus makes a revealing observation about circumcision in John 7:22-23:

> "Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken..." (John 7:22-23)

Jesus acknowledges that circumcision predates Moses -- it came from the patriarchs. Yet He calls the circumcision requirement "the law of Moses." This shows that the phrase refers not only to laws that originated at Sinai but to the entire codified legal system as organized and administered through Moses. Pre-existing practices were incorporated into and regulated by the Mosaic code.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

**The Bible does not say "the law of Moses" refers exclusively to ceremonial law.** Every comprehensive reference includes all categories -- moral, ceremonial, and civil. Those who limit the phrase to ceremonial law alone are narrowing it beyond what Scripture allows.

**The Bible does not say "the law of Moses" refers exclusively to moral law.** No occurrence of the phrase in all of Scripture identifies only the Decalogue as its content. When specific laws are cited under this phrase, they are ceremonial or civil regulations, not the Ten Commandments alone.

**The Bible does not say that interchangeable labels prove there are no distinctions within the law.** The fact that the same document receives the labels "law of Moses," "law of God," and "law of the LORD" tells us about the label, not about the internal structure of the document. A comprehensive label for the whole does not erase distinctions between the parts. The Ten Commandments were spoken directly by God, written by God's finger on stone, and placed inside the ark of the covenant. The broader legislation was spoken through Moses, written by Moses' hand in a book, and placed beside the ark. These observable biblical facts are not erased by the fact that a single label can cover both.

**The Bible does not say Paul articulated an explicit theory of "law of God" versus "law of Moses."** While the pattern in his usage is consistent and observable, Paul never states outright that he uses these phrases as technical labels for different categories of law. The distinction must be inferred from his usage patterns.

**The Bible does not say the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 released believers from moral law.** The dispute was about circumcision and ceremonial requirements for Gentile converts. The council's decree (Acts 15:28-29) retains the moral requirement to abstain from fornication while releasing Gentiles from ceremonial obligations. The moral law was not in dispute.

**The Bible does not say that because "the law of Moses" is comprehensive, all its parts must share the same fate.** The argument that if ceremonial laws are abolished, then moral laws must also be abolished -- because both are part of "the law of Moses" -- requires adding a concept Scripture does not state: that a comprehensive label means total indivisibility. The New Testament uses different vocabulary for what ceases (*dogma*, "ordinances"; *cheirographon*, "handwriting") and what continues (*entole*, "commandments of God"; the law as "holy, just, and good"). The contents of the comprehensive "law of Moses" are not treated as a single indivisible unit.

## Conclusion

The biblical evidence is abundant and clear on the main points. "The law of Moses" refers to the entire body of Pentateuchal legislation given through Moses. It encompasses moral commandments, ceremonial rituals, civil regulations, covenant curses, and the Pentateuch as literature. It is not limited to any single category.

The phrases "law of Moses," "law of God," and "law of the LORD" are demonstrably interchangeable in the Old Testament, describing the same comprehensive document from different perspectives: Moses as the human mediator, God as the divine author. The law belongs to both simultaneously.

Within this framework, Paul's writings show a usage pattern worth careful attention. When he speaks of "the law of God," the context identifies the Ten Commandments -- and his language is one of delight and service. When he speaks of "the law of Moses," the cited content is a civil regulation. This pattern, combined with consistent vocabulary distinctions throughout the New Testament (*entole* for moral commands, *dogma* for abolished ordinances), suggests that while the Old Testament labels are comprehensive and interchangeable, the New Testament writers recognized meaningful distinctions within that comprehensive body.

The key principle is this: a comprehensive label does not erase internal distinctions. The Bible applies different delivery methods, different writing media, different storage locations, and different New Testament vocabulary to different parts of the law -- even while calling the whole by a single name. Understanding "the law of Moses" as comprehensive is essential. Assuming that comprehensiveness means indivisibility goes beyond what the text states.
