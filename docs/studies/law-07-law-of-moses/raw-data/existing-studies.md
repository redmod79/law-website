## law-of-moses (standalone prior study)

**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-of-moses/CONCLUSION.md`
**Question:** What is the "law of Moses" -- does it refer to the moral law, the ceremonial law, or both?

**Key Findings:**
1. All 22 KJV occurrences of "law of Moses" were classified. When specific content is identifiable, it is ALWAYS ceremonial (Josh 8:31; 2 Chr 23:18; 30:16; Ezra 3:2; Luke 2:22; John 7:23; Acts 15:5), civil (2 Ki 14:6; 1 Cor 9:9), or covenant curses (Dan 9:11, 13) -- never exclusively the Decalogue.
2. When used comprehensively, it encompasses all categories but never the Decalogue alone (1 Ki 2:3; 2 Ki 23:25; Mal 4:4).
3. When used as a literary reference, it designates the Pentateuch (Luke 24:44; Acts 28:23).
4. The three phrases ("law of Moses," "law of God," "law of the LORD") can refer to the same document (Nehemiah 8; 2 Chr 34:14) but have distinct emphases: Moses = human mediator; God = divine Author; LORD = covenant relationship.
5. In Paul's usage, "law of God" refers specifically to the moral law/Decalogue (Rom 7:7, 22, 25; 8:7), while "law of Moses" refers to the broader Mosaic legislation (1 Cor 9:9).
6. The study identified a critical distinction between God's voice (Decalogue) and Moses' hand (broader legislation) based on Deu 5:22; 31:9, 24-26; Neh 9:13-14.

## law-01: God's Moral Law

**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-01-gods-moral-law/CONCLUSION.md`
**Question:** What is God's moral law? What is its basis, nature, and scope?

**Key Findings:**
1. The Decalogue has 7 unique markers: spoken by God's own voice, written by God's finger, engraved on stone, placed inside the ark, "he added no more," called "the covenant," called "the testimony."
2. Attributes assigned to the moral law mirror God's character: holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal.
3. The law's scope extends: before Sinai (Gen 26:5; Rom 5:12-14), beyond Israel (Rom 2:14-15), into the new covenant (Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10), to the end of time (Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14).
4. Evidence tally: 46 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items, 16 Neutral E-items.

## law-02: Law Before Sinai

**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-02-law-before-sinai/CONCLUSION.md`
**Question:** What evidence exists for the moral law operating from creation to Sinai?

**Key Findings:**
1. Six categories of pre-Sinai evidence: creation Sabbath (Gen 2:2-3), divine judgment of moral transgression (Cain, flood, Sodom), clean/unclean distinction (Gen 7:2), Abraham's obedience using Sinai vocabulary (Gen 26:5), adultery recognized as "sin against God" (Gen 39:9), manna-Sabbath test before Sinai (Exo 16:4, 28).
2. Romans 5:12-14 provides the logical framework: death reigned from Adam to Moses, implying law was operative.
3. Genesis 26:5 uses four law terms (mishmereth, mitsvah, chuqqah, towrah) -- the same vocabulary as Sinai legislation.

## law-03: Exodus 20 vs Later Laws

**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-03-exodus-20-vs-later-laws/CONCLUSION.md`
**Question:** How does the Exodus narrative distinguish the Decalogue from the laws given afterward?

**Key Findings:**
1. Five dimensions of distinction: delivery mode (God's voice vs. Moses' mediation), authorship (God's finger vs. Moses' hand), repository (inside ark vs. beside ark), naming conventions ("testimony"/"covenant" vs. "book of the law"), boundary marker ("he added no more").
2. Deuteronomy 4:13-14 is the most explicit distinction: "his covenant, even ten commandments" (v.13) vs. "statutes and judgments" (v.14).
3. Nehemiah 9:13-14 retrospectively confirms: God "spakest with them from heaven" (v.13) and "commandedst them...by the hand of Moses" (v.14).

## law-04: Ceremonial Laws

**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-04-ceremonial-laws/CONCLUSION.md`
**Question:** What are the ceremonial/ritual laws and how do they differ from the moral law?

**Key Findings:**
1. Five categories of ceremonial law: sacrifices (Lev 1-7), feasts (Lev 23:4-36), purity regulations (Lev 11-15), sanctuary service (Exo 25-30), circumcision (Gen 17; Acts 15; Gal 5).
2. Shadow/type vocabulary (skia, typos, antitypos, hypodeigma) is exclusively applied to ceremonial items, never to the Decalogue.
3. Cessation vocabulary (dogma [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, cheirographon G5498) is exclusively applied to ceremonial regulations, never to nomos/entole as moral law.
4. 1 Corinthians 7:19 is the key separator: "Circumcision is nothing...but the keeping of the commandments of God."
5. Hebrews 9:10: dikaiomata sarkos (carnal ordinances) "imposed until the time of reformation."

## law-05: Civil/Judicial Laws

**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-05-civil-judicial-laws/CONCLUSION.md`
**Question:** What are the civil/judicial laws and how do they relate to moral and ceremonial categories?

**Key Findings:**
1. Mishpatim (H4941) function as case-law applications of Decalogue moral principles to specific social situations.
2. The Bible uses three functionally distinct terms: mitsvot (commandments), chuqqim (statutes), mishpatim (judgments).
3. Civil laws overlap with the ceremonial system at specific points (Lev 6:1-7: civil restitution + trespass offering).
4. The NT transfers judicial function from theocratic state to secular government (Rom 13:1-7) and church community (1 Cor 6:1-8).
5. The threefold division (moral/ceremonial/civil) is classified as I-C (compatible framework, not explicitly stated in Scripture).

## law-06: Hebrew Law Vocabulary

**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-06-hebrew-law-vocabulary/CONCLUSION.md`
**Question:** What do torah, mitsvah, choq, mishpat, edut, piqqud, and chuqqah mean?

**Key Findings:**
1. Hebrew law terms describe formal character (instruction, command, decree, judgment, testimony), not moral categories (moral, ceremonial, civil).
2. Torah = "instruction/direction" (umbrella term). Mitsvah = "command" (also umbrella). Choq/chuqqah = "enacted decree/statute." Mishpat = "judgment/case law." Eduth = "testimony/attestation." Piqqud = "appointed charge/precept."
3. Eduth has exclusive Decalogue association in narrative contexts (Exo 25:16; 31:18; 34:29).
4. No single Hebrew term means exclusively "moral law" or "ceremonial law" -- each term's semantic range crosses the boundary.
5. In devotional contexts (Psalms 19, 119), the terms function as near-synonyms; in legislative contexts (Deuteronomy, Leviticus), they show structural distinctions.
6. LXX mappings: torah -> nomos (188x), mitsvah -> entole (153x), piqqud -> entole (19x, collapsing the Hebrew distinction).
7. 1 Kings 2:3 contains six law terms in one verse (mishmereth, chuqqah, mitsvah, mishpat, eduth), all said to be "written in the torah of Moses."
