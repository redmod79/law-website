## Part 1: Verse-by-Verse Analysis of "Law of Moses" Occurrences

### Joshua 8:31 -- Ceremonial Content
**Context:** After the conquest of Ai, Joshua builds an altar on Mount Ebal.
**Direct statement:** "As it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings."
**Key observations:** The specific content cited from "the law of Moses" is altar-building instructions (cf. Deu 27:5-6) and burnt/peace offerings -- ceremonial content. The broader context (vv.34-35) includes "all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings," which is comprehensive.
**Classification:** Ceremonial content specifically cited.

### Joshua 8:32 -- General/Comprehensive
**Context:** Same event as Josh 8:31.
**Direct statement:** "And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel."
**Key observations:** "A copy of the law" inscribed on stones (cf. Deu 27:3, 8). This is not a subset -- it is the entire law inscription. The phrase "law of Moses" here refers to the comprehensive Mosaic legislation.
**Classification:** General/Comprehensive.

### Joshua 23:6 -- General/Comprehensive
**Context:** Joshua's farewell address to Israel's leaders.
**Direct statement:** "Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left."
**Key observations:** "All that is written" -- comprehensive. The next verse (v.7) warns against idolatry (moral law, 1st/2nd commandment), showing the "law of Moses" includes moral content.
**Classification:** General/Comprehensive, with moral content exemplified.

### 1 Kings 2:3 -- General/Comprehensive (Full Four-Term Formula)
**Context:** David's deathbed charge to Solomon.
**Direct statement:** "To walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses."
**Key observations:** David uses the full four-term formula: chuqqim (statutes), mitsvoth (commandments), mishpatim (judgments), edoth (testimonies). These four terms represent the full taxonomy of Israel's legislation. The phrase "his statutes" and "his commandments" -- the possessive pronoun refers to God ("the LORD thy God" in v.3a), not to Moses. The law is called "law of Moses" but the content is attributed to God. Law-06 established that eduth has exclusive Decalogue association in narrative contexts. The presence of eduth (testimonies) alongside the other terms indicates that "the law of Moses" includes the Decalogue content.
**Cross-references:** Law-06 (E227) already catalogued this verse for its vocabulary cluster.
**Classification:** General/Comprehensive, explicitly including all categories.

### 2 Kings 14:6 -- Civil/Judicial
**Context:** Amaziah executing his father's murderers but sparing their children.
**Direct statement:** "According unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin."
**Key observations:** Direct quotation of Deuteronomy 24:16 -- a civil/judicial principle of individual criminal accountability. The phrase "wherein the LORD commanded" again attributes divine authorship to what is called "the law of Moses." This is a mishpat (case law/judgment) within the broader code.
**Cross-references:** Law-05 (E188) already catalogued the principle from Deu 24:16.
**Classification:** Civil/Judicial content specifically cited.

### 2 Kings 23:25 -- General/Comprehensive
**Context:** Summary of Josiah's unparalleled devotion.
**Direct statement:** "Turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses."
**Key observations:** "All the law of Moses" -- comprehensive. Josiah's reforms included both ceremonial (Passover restoration, vv.21-23) and moral (idolatry purge, vv.4-20, 24). The echo of "with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might" from Deuteronomy 6:5 (the Shema) connects the "law of Moses" to the moral/devotional core of the Decalogue.
**Classification:** General/Comprehensive.

### 2 Chronicles 23:18 -- Ceremonial
**Context:** Jehoiada's restoration of temple worship after the fall of Athaliah.
**Direct statement:** "To offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses."
**Key observations:** Specific content: burnt offerings -- ceremonial.
**Classification:** Ceremonial content specifically cited.

### 2 Chronicles 30:16 -- Ceremonial
**Context:** Hezekiah's Passover celebration.
**Direct statement:** "They stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood."
**Key observations:** Passover blood-sprinkling procedures -- ceremonial. The designation "man of God" applied to Moses elevates his role beyond mere scribe.
**Classification:** Ceremonial content specifically cited.

### Ezra 3:2 -- Ceremonial
**Context:** Post-exilic altar-building and burnt offerings.
**Direct statement:** "Builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God."
**Key observations:** Altar-building and burnt offerings -- ceremonial. Again "the man of God" applied to Moses.
**Classification:** Ceremonial content specifically cited.

### Ezra 7:6 -- General/Comprehensive
**Context:** Ezra's introduction as a skilled scribe.
**Direct statement:** "He was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given."
**Key observations:** General reference to Ezra's expertise. The phrase "which the LORD God of Israel had given" attributes the law to God while calling it "law of Moses." In the same context, v.10 says Ezra sought "the law of the LORD" and taught "statutes and judgments." The same man's expertise is described using both "law of Moses" (v.6) and "law of the LORD" (v.10) interchangeably.
**Classification:** General/Comprehensive. Both phrases used for the same body of knowledge.

### Nehemiah 8:1 -- General/Comprehensive (Critical Bridging Passage)
**Context:** Public reading of the law after the return from exile.
**Direct statement:** "They spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel."
**Key observations:** This is a critical passage. Within the span of 18 verses, the SAME DOCUMENT is called:
- "the book of the law of Moses" (v.1)
- "the law of God" (v.8)
- "the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses" (v.14)
- "the book of the law of God" (v.18)

Then in Nehemiah 9:3: "the book of the law of the LORD their God."

All three phrases -- "law of Moses," "law of God," and "law of the LORD" -- refer to the same physical book. The specific content discovered during the reading was the Feast of Tabernacles (v.14) -- ceremonial. But the book itself is comprehensive.
**Cross-references:** Nehemiah 10:29 explicitly states "God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God." This formulation shows Moses as the mediator/channel, not the originator.
**Classification:** General/Comprehensive. Three phrases used interchangeably for one document.

### Daniel 9:11 -- Covenant Curses
**Context:** Daniel's prayer of confession during the Babylonian exile.
**Direct statement:** "Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses."
**Key observations:** Daniel first says "thy law" (God's law) -- using a divine possessive. Then in the same sentence says "the law of Moses." The same law-body is called God's ("thy law") and Moses' ("law of Moses") in one verse. The specific content is "the curse...and the oath" -- the covenant curses of Deuteronomy 28-29.
**Classification:** Covenant curses. The passage demonstrates that "thy [God's] law" and "the law of Moses" are the same referent.

### Daniel 9:13 -- Covenant Curses
**Context:** Continuation of Daniel's prayer.
**Direct statement:** "As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us."
**Key observations:** The fulfilled covenant curses (Deu 28-30). Same context as Dan 9:11.
**Classification:** Covenant curses.

### Malachi 4:4 (Hebrew 3:22) -- General/Comprehensive
**Context:** God's final exhortation through the last OT prophet.
**Direct statement:** "Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments."
**Key observations:** God Himself speaks, calling it "the law of Moses **my servant**" and saying "which **I** commanded unto him." Moses is the servant/agent; God is the source. The Hebrew parsing confirms: towrat Mosheh (instruction of Moses) followed by chuqqim (statutes) and mishpatim (judgments). The addition of "with the statutes and judgments" expands the reference to comprehensive. The location "in Horeb" connects to both the Decalogue (spoken by God at Horeb) and the broader legislation (given through Moses at Horeb).
**Cross-references:** Hebrew parsing shows tsivviti (Piel Perfect 1st singular) = "I [God] commanded him [Moses]."
**Classification:** General/Comprehensive, with God as the acknowledged source.

### Luke 2:22 -- Ceremonial (Critical Bridging Passage)
**Context:** Mary's purification and Jesus' presentation at the temple.
**Direct statement:** "When the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished."
**Key observations:** CRITICAL PASSAGE. Within three verses:
- v.22: "the law of Moses" -- purification (Lev 12) = ceremonial
- v.23: "the law of the Lord" -- firstborn presentation (Exo 13:2) = ceremonial
- v.24: "the law of the Lord" -- sacrifice offering (Lev 12:8) = ceremonial

Luke uses "law of Moses" and "law of the Lord" interchangeably for the same body of ceremonial legislation in the same passage. The Greek confirms: "nomon Mouseos" (v.22) and "nomō Kyriou" (vv.23-24) use the same root noun (nomos) with different genitives.
**Classification:** Ceremonial content. Both phrases used interchangeably.

### Luke 24:44 -- Literary/Pentateuch
**Context:** Post-resurrection, Jesus teaches the disciples.
**Direct statement:** "All things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me."
**Key observations:** "Law of Moses, prophets, psalms" = the threefold division of the Hebrew Bible (Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim). Here "law of Moses" = the Pentateuch as a literary unit, not a specific legal category. The messianic prophecies within the Pentateuch span multiple law categories (Gen 3:15 promise, Gen 22 sacrifice, Deu 18:15 prophet).
**Classification:** Literary/Pentateuch reference.

### John 7:23 -- Ceremonial (Circumcision)
**Context:** Jesus defends healing on the Sabbath.
**Direct statement:** "If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?"
**Key observations:** Jesus identifies circumcision as a requirement of "the law of Moses." He then notes that circumcision "is not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers" (v.22) -- circumcision predates Moses (Gen 17). Yet the observance requirement is attributed to "the law of Moses." Jesus uses the fact that circumcision (ceremonial) overrides the Sabbath to argue that healing (a greater work) also overrides any objection. The argument assumes a hierarchy within the law.
**Classification:** Ceremonial content (circumcision) specifically cited.

### Acts 13:39 -- Justification Context
**Context:** Paul's synagogue sermon in Pisidian Antioch.
**Direct statement:** "By him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses."
**Key observations:** Paul contrasts justification by faith with justification by "the law of Moses." The Greek uses anarthrous nomos (no article -- "en nomo Mouseos"), which may emphasize qualitative character rather than a specific document. The referent could be comprehensive (the entire Mosaic system could not justify) or specifically the ceremonial system (sacrifices could not truly justify -- cf. Heb 10:4). The argument is about the law's inability to justify, not about which laws continue.
**Cross-references:** Hebrews 10:1-4 establishes that the sacrificial system could not make comers perfect or take away sins.
**Classification:** General (justification context). The statement is about what "the law of Moses" could NOT do (justify), not about which laws it contains.

### Acts 15:5 -- Ceremonial (Circumcision Primarily)
**Context:** The Jerusalem Council debate.
**Direct statement:** "There rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses."
**Key observations:** The specific trigger is circumcision (v.5) -- ceremonial. The Greek parsing shows three infinitives: peritemnein (to circumcise), parangellein (to command), terein (to keep). Circumcision is singled out from "the law of Moses" -- it is one specific item within a broader body. The council's ruling (vv.28-29) addresses ceremonial matters (meats, blood, strangled things) plus fornication (moral). The council did NOT address the Decalogue -- the moral commandments were not in dispute. The entire debate was about whether Gentiles must undergo Jewish ceremonies.
**Cross-references:** E145 (Peter calls this requirement "a yoke"), E146 (the council's decision).
**Classification:** Ceremonial content primarily. "The law of Moses" is used for the broader code, but the specific dispute is ceremonial.

### Acts 28:23 -- Literary/Pentateuch
**Context:** Paul's final witness in Rome.
**Direct statement:** "Persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets."
**Key observations:** "Law of Moses...and the prophets" = the two-part division of the OT. Paul uses the Pentateuch as a literary source to teach about Jesus. Same literary usage as Luke 24:44.
**Classification:** Literary/Pentateuch reference.

### 1 Corinthians 9:9 -- Civil/Agricultural
**Context:** Paul argues for apostolic rights to material support.
**Direct statement:** "For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn."
**Key observations:** Direct quotation of Deuteronomy 25:4 -- an agricultural regulation (civil/practical). Paul uses "in the law of Moses" (en to Mouseos nomo) when citing this regulation. The Greek word order places "Mouseos" (of Moses) before "nomo" (law) in an emphatic position. Paul then applies the underlying principle to apostolic support -- extracting a moral/spiritual principle from a civil regulation.
**Cross-references:** Paul uses "law of God" for the Decalogue (Rom 7:22, 25; 8:7) but "law of Moses" for a civil regulation. This is a data point for the question of whether Paul distinguishes the two phrases.
**Classification:** Civil/Agricultural content specifically cited.

### Hebrews 10:28 -- Civil/Judicial
**Context:** Warning against willful sin after receiving truth.
**Direct statement:** "He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses."
**Key observations:** "Moses' law" (nomon Mouseos, anarthrous) -- the judicial procedure requiring two or three witnesses for capital punishment (Deu 17:6). The content is civil/judicial. The author uses this as a lesser-to-greater argument: if despising Moses' law brought death, how much worse to trample the Son of God.
**Cross-references:** E186, E197. The parallels tool correctly identified Deuteronomy 17:6 as the primary OT source.
**Classification:** Civil/Judicial content specifically cited.

## Part 2: "Law of God" Analysis (7 Occurrences)

### Joshua 24:26 -- Same Document as "Law of Moses"
Joshua wrote "these words in the book of the law of God." This is the same document to which Moses had written and which is elsewhere called "the book of the law of Moses." Joshua appends covenant words to the existing book.

### Nehemiah 8:8, 18 -- Interchangeable with "Law of Moses"
In the same chapter, v.1 calls the book "the law of Moses," v.8 calls it "the law of God," and v.18 calls it "the book of the law of God." The same physical document, the same reading event, three different designations. No distinction in referent.

### Nehemiah 10:28-29 -- Explicit Bridging Verse
"God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God." This formulation explicitly connects the two phrases. The law is GOD'S in its origin and authority; it was GIVEN BY MOSES as mediator. The subsequent content (v.30-31) includes intermarriage prohibition and sabbath-keeping -- combining moral and civil elements.

### Romans 7:22, 25 -- Paul's "Law of God" = The Decalogue
Paul "delights in the law of God after the inward man" (v.22) and "with the mind serves the law of God" (v.25). The context (v.7) identifies this law by the 10th commandment: "Thou shalt not covet." Paul's "law of God" in Romans 7 is specifically the Decalogue/moral law.

**Greek note:** "to nomo tou Theou" -- dative, articular. The genitive "tou Theou" indicates origin/source: the law that comes from God.

### Romans 8:7 -- The Standard the Carnal Mind Cannot Meet
"The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." The "law of God" is the standard of conduct from which the carnal mind is permanently alienated. Same context as Romans 7 -- the referent is the moral law identified by the Decalogue.

**Greek note:** "hypotassetai" -- present passive indicative, "is not being subjected to." "oude gar dynatai" -- "neither indeed is it able." The present tense indicates an ongoing inability, not a temporary condition.

---

## Part 3: "Law of the LORD" Analysis (19 Occurrences)

### Key Pattern: Content Spans All Categories

The 19 "law of the LORD" occurrences span the full range of law-content:

**Ceremonial content:**
- 1 Chr 16:40 -- burnt offerings
- 2 Chr 31:3 -- burnt offerings and set feasts
- 2 Chr 31:4 -- priestly portions/tithes
- Luke 2:23-24 -- firstborn presentation, sacrifice

**Moral content (idolatry, disobedience):**
- 2 Ki 10:31 -- Jehu's idolatry (golden calves) = 1st/2nd commandment violation
- Amos 2:4 -- "despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments"

**General/Comprehensive:**
- 1 Chr 22:12 -- general charge
- 2 Chr 12:1 -- Rehoboam forsook the law
- 2 Chr 17:9 -- teaching "the book of the law"
- 2 Chr 34:14 -- "the law of the LORD given by Moses" (bridging phrase)
- 2 Chr 35:26 -- Josiah's acts
- Ezra 7:10 -- Ezra's expertise
- Neh 9:3 -- public reading
- Isa 5:24 -- casting away God's law
- Isa 30:9 -- refusing to hear
- Jer 8:8 -- scribes' claim

**Devotional/Attribute:**
- Psa 1:2 -- delight and meditation
- Psa 19:7 -- "perfect, converting the soul"
- Psa 119:1 -- "blessed are the undefiled"

### The Bridging Verse: 2 Chronicles 34:14
"Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses." This explicitly unites "the law of the LORD" with "given by Moses" -- the same formulation as Nehemiah 10:29 ("God's law, which was given by Moses"). The law is attributed to the LORD in authority and to Moses in mediation.

---

## Part 4: Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: The Phrase "Law of Moses" Covers All Categories of Law
When specific content is identifiable in "law of Moses" verses:
- 7 occurrences cite ceremonial content (altar, burnt offerings, blood sprinkling, purification, circumcision)
- 3 occurrences cite civil/judicial content (individual accountability, muzzling the ox, witness requirement)
- 2 occurrences cite covenant curses
- 2 occurrences use the phrase as a literary designation for the Pentateuch
- 7 occurrences are general/comprehensive, including "all the law" with multiple sub-categories

No occurrence specifically identifies the Decalogue/moral law as "the law of Moses" to the exclusion of other content. When the phrase is comprehensive, it explicitly includes "commandments, statutes, judgments, and testimonies" -- all categories.

### Pattern 2: The Three Phrases Are Interchangeable for the Same Document
The bridging passages demonstrate that "law of Moses," "law of God," and "law of the LORD" refer to the same body of legislation:
- **Nehemiah 8:1-9:3** -- all three phrases used for the same book in the same reading event
- **Nehemiah 10:29** -- "God's law, which was given by Moses"
- **2 Chronicles 34:14** -- "the law of the LORD given by Moses"
- **Luke 2:22-24** -- "law of Moses" (v.22) and "law of the Lord" (vv.23-24) for the same legislation
- **Ezra 7:6, 10** -- same man's expertise described as both "law of Moses" and "law of the LORD"
- **Daniel 9:11** -- "thy [God's] law" and "the law of Moses" in the same verse for the same thing

### Pattern 3: Paul Distinguishes "Law of God" from "Law of Moses"
While the OT uses the phrases interchangeably for the same document, Paul's usage shows a distinction:
- **"Law of God"** (Rom 7:22, 25; 8:7) -- identified by context (Rom 7:7) as the Decalogue ("Thou shalt not covet"). Paul delights in it, serves it with his mind, and identifies the carnal mind's enmity against it.
- **"Law of Moses"** (1 Cor 9:9) -- a civil/agricultural regulation (Deu 25:4, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox"). Paul cites this as a principle from the broader Mosaic code.

Paul uses "law of God" for the moral law he delights in and "law of Moses" for the broader code from which he extracts principles. This distinction is observable in the text, though it appears only in Paul's letters and is not explicitly theorized by Paul himself.

### Pattern 4: The Genitive Modifier Identifies the Relationship
All three phrases use the same noun (torah/nomos) with different genitive modifiers:
- **Moses** = the human mediator through whom the law was given
- **God / the LORD** = the divine source/author of the law

The genitive of Moses is one of mediation/agency ("given BY Moses"). The genitive of God/LORD is one of source/authority ("the law that BELONGS TO God"). This is confirmed by passages where both relationships are stated: "the law of Moses...which the LORD had commanded" (Neh 8:1, 14); "the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded" (Mal 4:4).

### Pattern 5: "Law of Moses" Never Refers Exclusively to the Moral Law
In all 21 law-code occurrences, when specific content is identifiable, it is always ceremonial, civil, or covenant-curse content. When the reference is general/comprehensive, it includes all categories. No passage uses "the law of Moses" to refer specifically and exclusively to the Decalogue or moral commandments. The moral law is always included within the broader reference, never isolated.

By contrast, Paul's "law of God" in Romans 7-8 is specifically identified as the moral law (by the 10th commandment in 7:7).

---

## Part 5: Connections Between Passages

### The Mediation Framework
Malachi 4:4 provides the definitive statement of the relationship: God Himself says "the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him." The law is:
1. Called "the law of Moses" (attribution of mediation)
2. Attributed to God: "which I commanded" (divine source)
3. Moses is "my servant" (agency, not origination)

This framework explains why the phrases are interchangeable: they describe the same law from two perspectives. "Law of Moses" highlights the human channel; "law of God" / "law of the LORD" highlights the divine author.

### Paul's Romans 7-8 and 1 Corinthians 9
Paul's distinction between "law of God" (moral/Decalogue, Rom 7:22-8:7) and "law of Moses" (civil regulation, 1 Cor 9:9) is the most notable data point for the positional question. However, this is a single author's usage in specific contexts. The OT evidence (Nehemiah, Chronicles, Ezra) shows the phrases were historically interchangeable for the same comprehensive document.

The question is whether Paul's distinct usage reflects a genuine theological distinction (supporting the Continues position that moral and broader law are distinguishable) or merely contextual variation (the same comprehensive law viewed from different angles).

### Luke 2:22-24 as Test Case
Luke uses "law of Moses" and "law of the Lord" in the same passage for ceremonial regulations. This demonstrates that "law of the Lord" does not exclusively mean the moral law. Yet the Psalms use "the law of the LORD" in contexts that emphasize moral/devotional content (Psa 1:2; 19:7). The phrase itself does not determine the category -- context does.

---

## Part 6: Word Study Insights

### Torah/Nomos as Umbrella Term
The word study confirms that torah (H8451) and nomos (G3551) are umbrella terms. Deuteronomy 4:44-45 explicitly defines torah as encompassing edot (testimonies), chuqqim (statutes), and mishpatim (judgments). The "law of Moses" is the torah of Moses -- the comprehensive instruction given through Moses as mediator.

### Entole vs. Nomos in the NT
A significant vocabulary pattern emerges:
- **Entole** (commandment, G1785) is used for "commandments of God" (1 Cor 7:19; Rev 12:17; 14:12) -- associated with the moral law.
- **Nomos** (law, G3551) is the shared term in "law of Moses," "law of God," and "law of the LORD."
- **Dogma** (ordinance, G1378) is used for what was abolished (Col 2:14; Eph 2:15) -- never for the Decalogue.
- Entole does NOT appear in any "law of Moses" phrase in the NT.

This distribution suggests NT authors used different vocabulary for moral commands (entole tou theou) versus the broader Mosaic legislation (nomos Mouseos), though this pattern is not explicitly articulated by any NT author.

### The Genitive Constructions
Greek parsing confirms:
- "tou Theou" (of God) in Rom 7:22 = genitive of source/origin
- "Mouseos" in 1 Cor 9:9 = genitive of authorship/mediation, with emphatic word order
- Both modify the same noun (nomos), but the genitive identifies different relationships

---

## Part 7: Difficult Passages

### Acts 13:39 -- What Could the Law Not Do?
"By him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses." The difficulty: does "law of Moses" here mean the entire Mosaic system (comprehensive) or specifically the ceremonial/sacrificial system (which could not truly justify)?

The text does not specify which aspect of the law failed to justify. The statement is about the limitation of "the law of Moses" as a whole in the matter of justification. Both positions can accept this as a factual observation: the Mosaic system (however defined) could not provide justification -- only faith in Christ can.

### Acts 15:5 -- "Keep the Law of Moses"
The Pharisees demanded circumcision AND keeping "the law of Moses." Did they mean the whole law, or specifically the ceremonial requirements? The council's answer (vv.28-29) addresses ceremonial matters plus fornication. The moral commandments were never in dispute -- no one questioned whether Gentile believers should avoid murder, theft, or idolatry. The entire controversy was about whether Gentiles must adopt the Jewish ceremonial system. The phrase "the law of Moses" in this context functions as a label for the Mosaic ceremonial/civil system as experienced by Gentile converts.

### Nehemiah 10:29 -- Does Bridging Prove Synonymy?
"God's law, which was given by Moses" explicitly connects the two phrases. Does this prove "law of God" = "law of Moses" with no distinction? The formulation shows they describe the same body of law from different angles (divine source vs. human mediation). It does not prove they always have identical referents in every context -- Paul's usage in Romans 7-8 vs. 1 Corinthians 9 suggests contextual variation is possible even within the same author.

### 2 Corinthians 3:7 -- The Ministration Written on Stone
"The ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious...which glory was to be done away." The law "written and engraven in stones" is identified as the Decalogue. Its "ministration" (diakonia, mode of administration) is said to have glory that is being surpassed. The text says the glory of the ministration is "done away" (katargeo), not that the law itself is done away. The subject of katargeo is "the glory" (he doxa), not "the law" (ho nomos). This passage is already catalogued (E048) and addressed in prior studies.
