# What Does "The Law of Moses" Refer To?

## Question
What does "the law of Moses" refer to -- moral, ceremonial, or both? Classify all 21 law-code occurrences by identifiable content. Examine Paul's "law of God" vs "law of Moses" usage. Compare with "law of the LORD" occurrences to determine whether these phrases are synonymous or carry distinct referents.

## Summary Answer
The phrase "the law of Moses" in the KJV refers to the comprehensive body of Pentateuchal legislation -- it is not restricted to any single category (moral, ceremonial, or civil). When specific content is identifiable, it spans ceremonial (7 occurrences), civil/judicial (3), covenant curses (2), and literary/Pentateuch (2). When general, it explicitly includes all sub-categories (7). The OT bridging passages (Neh 8:1-9:3; 10:29; 2 Chr 34:14; Luke 2:22-24) demonstrate that "law of Moses," "law of God," and "law of the LORD" are interchangeable designations for the same document, describing it from different perspectives (human mediator vs. divine author). Paul's usage in Romans 7-8 vs. 1 Corinthians 9 shows a possible contextual distinction where "law of God" refers to the Decalogue specifically and "law of Moses" refers to the broader code.

## Key Verses

**Malachi 4:4** -- "Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments." God Himself attributes the law to Moses as mediator ("my servant") while claiming authorship ("I commanded"). Comprehensive.

**Nehemiah 8:1, 8, 14, 18** -- The same book called "the book of the law of Moses" (v.1), "the law of God" (v.8, 18), and "the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses" (v.14). Three phrases, one document.

**Nehemiah 10:29** -- "God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God." Explicit bridge: God's law, given through Moses.

**2 Chronicles 34:14** -- "A book of the law of the LORD given by Moses." Explicit bridge: the LORD's law, given by Moses.

**Romans 7:22, 25; 8:7** -- Paul's "law of God" identified by context (Rom 7:7, "Thou shalt not covet") as the Decalogue/moral law. Paul delights in it and serves it with his mind.

**1 Corinthians 9:9** -- Paul's "law of Moses" cites a civil/agricultural regulation (Deu 25:4), not the Decalogue.

**Luke 2:22-24** -- "Law of Moses" (v.22) and "law of the Lord" (vv.23-24) used interchangeably for the same ceremonial legislation in the same passage.

| E1 | The phrase "law of Moses" appears 21 times in the KJV as a law-code reference (excluding Jdg 4:11 "father in law of Moses"). The Hebrew is "torat Mosheh" (construct chain); the Greek is "nomos Mouseos" (genitive construction). | Josh 8:31 through Heb 10:28 (21 verses) | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E2 | When specific content is identified in "law of Moses" verses, it is ceremonial (7x: altar/offerings in Josh 8:31, 2 Chr 23:18, 2 Chr 30:16, Ezra 3:2; purification in Luke 2:22; circumcision in John 7:23, Acts 15:5), civil/judicial (3x: individual accountability in 2 Ki 14:6; muzzling ox in 1 Cor 9:9; witness requirement in Heb 10:28), covenant curses (2x: Dan 9:11, 13), or literary/Pentateuch (2x: Luke 24:44, Acts 28:23). No occurrence identifies exclusively Decalogue/moral content. | Multiple (see 02-verses.md) | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E3 | When "law of Moses" references are general/comprehensive (7 of 21), they explicitly include all sub-categories using the four-term formula or "all": "statutes, commandments, judgments, testimonies" (1 Ki 2:3); "all the law" (2 Ki 23:25); "all that is written" (Josh 23:6); "with the statutes and judgments" (Mal 4:4). | Josh 8:32; 23:6; 1 Ki 2:3; 2 Ki 23:25; Ezra 7:6; Neh 8:1; Mal 4:4 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E4 | In Nehemiah 8, the same physical book is called "the book of the law of Moses" (v.1), "the law of God" (v.8), "the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses" (v.14), and "the book of the law of God" (v.18). All three phrase-types designate the same document. | Neh 8:1, 8, 14, 18 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E5 | Nehemiah 10:29 states: "God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God." The text explicitly identifies the same law as both God's (in authority/origin) and Moses' (in mediation/delivery). | Neh 10:29 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E6 | 2 Chronicles 34:14 states: "Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses." The text explicitly identifies the same document as both "the law of the LORD" and "given by Moses." | 2 Chr 34:14 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E7 | In Luke 2:22-24, Luke uses "the law of Moses" (v.22) for purification and "the law of the Lord" (vv.23-24) for firstborn presentation and sacrifice -- interchangeably for the same body of ceremonial legislation in the same passage. | Luke 2:22-24 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E8 | In Ezra 7:6, 10, the same person's expertise is described as "the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given" (v.6) and "the law of the LORD" (v.10). The phrases are used interchangeably. | Ezra 7:6, 10 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E9 | In Daniel 9:11, the same law is called "thy law" (God's law, using divine possessive) and "the law of Moses" in the same verse: "all Israel have transgressed thy law...the curse...that is written in the law of Moses." | Dan 9:11 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E10 | God Himself uses the phrase "the law of Moses my servant" in Malachi 4:4 and states "which I commanded unto him in Horeb." The Hebrew shows tsivviti (Piel Perfect 1st singular) = "I [God] commanded him [Moses]." Moses is the servant-mediator; God is the commanding source. | Mal 4:4 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E11 | Malachi 4:4 appends "with the statutes [chuqqim] and judgments [mishpatim]" after "the law of Moses my servant." The two additional terms expand the reference beyond the base phrase. | Mal 4:4 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E12 | Paul uses "the law of God" (nomos tou Theou) in Romans 7:22, 25 and 8:7. The context (Rom 7:7) identifies the referent by the 10th commandment: "Thou shalt not covet." Paul delights in this law (v.22) and serves it with his mind (v.25). | Rom 7:7, 22, 25; 8:7 | Continues | V1: Yes -- "delight in the law of God" = law-continuation vocabulary applied to God's commandments (identified by 10th commandment). Gate 1: PASS -- referent identified by the Decalogue commandment in 7:7. Gate 2: PASS -- grammar unambiguous; "the law of God" is the object of synēdomai (delight) and douleuō (serve). Gate 3: PASS -- didactic epistle. Gate 4: PASS -- consistent with E010, E011, E046. Classification stands: **Continues**. |
| E13 | Paul uses "the law of Moses" (en to Mouseos nomo) in 1 Corinthians 9:9 to cite Deuteronomy 25:4 ("Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox"). The cited content is a civil/agricultural regulation, not a Decalogue commandment. | 1 Cor 9:9 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E14 | Jesus notes that circumcision predates Moses ("not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers" -- John 7:22) yet calls the circumcision requirement "the law of Moses" (John 7:23). A pre-Mosaic practice is included within "the law of Moses." | John 7:22-23 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E15 | Paul states: "By him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses" (Acts 13:39). The "law of Moses" could not accomplish justification. | Acts 13:39 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No -- the verse states a limitation of the law, not its cessation or continuation. Result: Neutral. |
| E16 | The Pharisees demanded: "That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses" (Acts 15:5). Circumcision is singled out alongside "the law of Moses" as a separate item, using two infinitives joined by "te" (and also). | Acts 15:5 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E17 | Jesus states: "All things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me" (Luke 24:44). "The law of Moses" = the Pentateuch as a literary division alongside "the prophets" and "the psalms." | Luke 24:44 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E18 | Paul persuaded Jews in Rome "concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets" (Acts 28:23). "The law of Moses" = the Pentateuch as a literary source for messianic teaching. | Acts 28:23 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E19 | The "law of the LORD" references ceremonial content in multiple passages: burnt offerings (1 Chr 16:40; 2 Chr 31:3), set feasts (2 Chr 31:3), priestly portions (2 Chr 31:4), firstborn presentation and sacrifice (Luke 2:23-24). The phrase "law of the LORD" is not restricted to moral law. | 1 Chr 16:40; 2 Chr 31:3-4; Luke 2:23-24 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E20 | The "law of the LORD" also references moral content: 2 Kings 10:31 identifies Jehu's failure as departing from the golden-calf idolatry of Jeroboam (1st/2nd commandment violation). Amos 2:4 parallels "the law of the LORD" with "his commandments." | 2 Ki 10:31; Amos 2:4 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E21 | In the "law of Moses" NT occurrences, the Greek noun nomos (G3551) is the same word used in Paul's "law of God" (nomos tou Theou). The genitive modifier differs (Mouseos vs. Theou), but the base noun is identical. | Rom 7:22; 1 Cor 9:9; Acts 13:39; etc. | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E22 | The Greek word entole (G1785, "commandment") does not appear in any "law of Moses" phrase in the NT. Entole appears in "commandments of God" phrases (1 Cor 7:19; Rev 12:17; 14:12). | NT data | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| E23 | The Greek word dogma (G1378, "ordinance/decree") does not appear in any "law of Moses" phrase. Dogma appears in cessation contexts (Col 2:14; Eph 2:15) and civil decree contexts (Luke 2:1; Acts 16:4; 17:7). | NT data | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |

### Necessary Implications

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Tree 4 Trace |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The phrases "law of Moses," "law of God," and "law of the LORD" designate the same body of legislation, since the same physical document receives all three labels in Nehemiah 8-9, and explicit bridging formulas unite them (Neh 10:29; 2 Chr 34:14). | E4, E5, E6 | Neutral | Gate 0: N-Test 1 (universal agreement) = YES -- both sides must acknowledge the same book has all three names in Neh 8. N-Test 2 (no interpretation) = YES -- no choice between readings. N-Test 3 (zero added concepts) = YES -- directly entailed by the three verse-citations. PASS. V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| N2 | The phrase "law of Moses" identifies Moses as the human mediator/agent of the law, not as its ultimate author, since Malachi 4:4 has God Himself say "the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded," and multiple other passages attribute the content to God while calling it "the law of Moses" (Neh 8:1 "which the LORD had commanded"; 2 Ki 14:6 "wherein the LORD commanded"). | E10, E4, E5, E6 | Neutral | Gate 0: PASS -- all three N-tests satisfied (both sides acknowledge Moses is the mediator and God the source). V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| N3 | Paul's "law of God" in Romans 7-8 has a more specific referent than "the law of Moses" as used in the OT, since Paul identifies it by the 10th commandment (Rom 7:7) whereas OT "law of Moses" passages reference comprehensive content. | E12, E13, E2, E3 | Neutral | Gate 0: N-Test 1 = YES -- a scholar from either position would agree that Paul's "law of God" in Rom 7 is identified by the 10th commandment, while OT "law of Moses" includes all categories. N-Test 2 = YES. N-Test 3 = YES -- the observation requires no added framework; it is a comparison of textually identified referents. PASS. V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| N4 | The "law of the LORD" is not restricted to moral content, since it is used for ceremonial regulations (burnt offerings, feasts, priestly portions) in multiple passages (1 Chr 16:40; 2 Chr 31:3-4; Luke 2:23-24). | E19 | Neutral | Gate 0: PASS -- all three N-tests satisfied. V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |
| N5 | The genitive modifier in the phrase identifies the relationship of the named person/entity to the law: "of Moses" = mediation/agency; "of God" / "of the LORD" = source/authority. The same law has both relationships simultaneously. | E5, E6, E9, E10 | Neutral | Gate 0: PASS -- both sides accept that Moses mediated and God authored. V1: No. V2: No. Result: Neutral. |

### Inferences

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria | Position | Tree 5 Trace |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | Paul distinguishes "the law of God" (moral/Decalogue) from "the law of Moses" (broader Mosaic code) as two different categories of law, supporting the Continues position that the Bible itself differentiates law categories. | I-A | Paul uses "law of God" (nomos tou Theou) for the law identified by the 10th commandment in Rom 7:7, calling it holy, just, good (Rom 7:12), and spiritual (Rom 7:14) (E12, E010, E011). He uses "law of Moses" (nomos Mouseos) for a civil/agricultural regulation in 1 Cor 9:9 (E13). The two phrases have different genitive modifiers and different contextual referents. | Paul never explicitly states that he uses these phrases for different categories of law. The distinction must be inferred from the pattern of usage across two different epistles. The two uses occur in different arguments for different purposes. Systematization (criterion #5) is required to connect the vocabulary pattern to a categorical distinction. | #5 (systematizing) | Continues | IP0: NO -- concerns the distinction between moral and broader law, not merely ceremonial cessation. IP1: YES -- supports the existence of a biblical distinction between moral and broader law categories. Result: **Continues**. |
| I2 | The OT interchangeability of "law of Moses," "law of God," and "law of the LORD" proves there is no distinction between moral and broader law -- the law is one unified body attributed to both God and Moses without differentiation. This supports the Abolished position that all law is a single indivisible unit. | I-B | The bridging passages show the same document has all three names (E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, E9). However, Paul's usage shows a possible distinction within the same-named body (E12, E13, I1). Prior studies show that the Decalogue has unique delivery, authorship, medium, repository, naming, and boundary ("he added no more") distinguishing it from other laws within the same body (N001, N002, N011-N015 in master file). | The claim requires interpreting the interchangeability as proving no internal differentiation. But the same document can contain internally distinct categories -- a comprehensive tax code contains both income tax and estate tax, and calling the whole document "the tax code" does not erase the internal distinction. Criterion #2 (choosing between readings): the interchangeability could mean (a) no internal distinction or (b) the labels describe the whole while the parts are still differentiated. Both readings are possible. | #2, #5 | Abolished | IP0: NO. IP2: YES -- supports the claim that all law is a single indivisible unit with no distinction. Result: **Abolished**. |
| I3 | The fact that "law of Moses" never refers exclusively to the Decalogue proves that the moral law has no separate identity within the Mosaic system -- it is merely one section of an undivided whole. | I-B | No "law of Moses" passage identifies exclusively Decalogue/moral content (E2). When comprehensive, the phrase includes "commandments, statutes, judgments, testimonies" -- all categories together (E3). However, the Decalogue HAS unique markers distinguishing it within this comprehensive body (master file: N001, N002, N011-N015). Paul's "law of God" CAN identify the Decalogue specifically (E12). | The claim adds a concept the text does not state: that the absence of an exclusive Decalogue reference in "law of Moses" proves the Decalogue has no distinct identity. The data show the phrase is comprehensive (includes all categories); it does not follow that the included categories are indistinguishable. A label for the whole does not negate distinctions within the whole. Criterion #1 (adding a concept) and #2 (choosing between readings). | #1, #2 | Abolished | IP0: NO. IP2: YES -- supports the claim that all law is one undivided unit. Result: **Abolished**. |
| I4 | Paul's distinct usage of "law of God" (Decalogue) vs. "law of Moses" (broader code) demonstrates that the NT maintains a theological distinction between the moral law and the broader Mosaic system, supporting the Continues position. | I-A | Paul uses "law of God" for the Decalogue (E12) and "law of Moses" for a civil regulation (E13). The same distinction is reflected in vocabulary: entole (commandment) is used for "commandments of God" but never in "law of Moses" phrases (E22). Dogma (ordinance) is used for cessation vocabulary but never for the Decalogue (E23). These patterns are text-derived observations requiring only systematization. | This extends the vocabulary pattern to a theological conclusion. Paul does not explicitly say "I use 'law of God' for the moral law and 'law of Moses' for the broader code." The systematization connects usage patterns across epistles. Criterion #5 (systematizing). | #5 | Continues | IP0: NO. IP1: YES -- supports the existence of a biblical distinction between law categories. Result: **Continues**. |
| I5 | The bridging passages (Neh 10:29; 2 Chr 34:14; Dan 9:11) support the Continues position because they show that the "law of Moses" was understood as GOD'S law given THROUGH Moses -- preserving Moses' role as mediator/agent while attributing ultimate authority to God. This is consistent with the Continues distinction between the directly-spoken Decalogue (God's in a special sense) and the mediated legislation (also God's but given through Moses). | I-A | Neh 10:29: "God's law, which was given by Moses" (E5). 2 Chr 34:14: "the law of the LORD given by Moses" (E6). Dan 9:11: "thy law...the law of Moses" (E9). Mal 4:4: "the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded" (E10). These establish the mediation framework: God is author, Moses is mediator. Prior studies established that the Decalogue had a different delivery mode -- God spoke directly, bypassing the mediator (master file: E001, E002, N001). | This connects the mediation framework to the Continues distinction between direct Decalogue delivery and mediated broader-law delivery. The texts themselves describe the mediation relationship; the inference is that this relationship supports the Decalogue/broader-law distinction. Criterion #5 (systematizing). | #5 | Continues | IP0: NO. IP1: YES -- supports the existence of a distinction between directly-spoken and mediated law. Result: **Continues**. |
| I6 | Acts 15:5 and the Jerusalem Council demonstrate that "the law of Moses" refers to the entire undivided law, because the Pharisees demanded keeping ALL of it and the council released Gentiles from ALL of it, including the moral law. | I-D | The Pharisees said to "circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses" (E16). The council released Gentiles from this requirement (E146 in master file). But the council's decree (Acts 15:28-29) retains fornication as a required abstention -- a moral commandment. The council never released anyone from the moral law; the dispute was about circumcision and ceremonial requirements. James' speech (v.21) assumes Moses is read every Sabbath in synagogues -- the moral content is not in dispute. | This requires adding a concept the text does not state: that the council released Gentiles from moral commandments. The text shows the opposite -- fornication (moral) is retained. The claim overrides E146 and the council's own words. Criterion #1 (adding concept not stated) and external reading that overrides the text's own distinction between what was released and what was retained. | #1, overrides E146 | Neutral | IP0: YES -- the entire Acts 15 dispute concerns circumcision and ceremonial requirements, which both sides agree ceased. The council's ruling addresses ceremonial matters. Result: **Neutral**. |
| I7 | The comprehensive scope of "the law of Moses" (including moral, ceremonial, and civil content in one label) proves that all law categories share the same fate -- if ceremonial laws are abolished, moral laws must be too, since they are part of the same "law of Moses." | I-D | "The law of Moses" includes all categories (E2, E3). Prior studies establish that the NT uses different vocabulary for what is abolished (dogma) vs. what continues (entole, nomos as moral law) -- master file E053, E054, E143, N017, N018. The claim requires overriding these vocabulary distinctions, treating the comprehensive label as proof of indivisibility. | This overrides multiple E/N items from prior studies (E053, E054, E143, N017, N018, N019) that show the NT distinguishes between what is abolished and what continues WITHIN the same comprehensive body. The argument assumes a comprehensive label proves no internal distinction -- but a library label "books" does not prove all books have the same fate. Criterion #1 (adding the concept of indivisibility from label), overrides existing E/N items. | #1, overrides E053/E054/E143/N017/N018 | Abolished | IP0: NO. IP2: YES -- supports the claim that all law is a single unit that shares the same fate. Result: **Abolished**. |

### I-B Resolution Subsections

#### I-B Resolution: I2 -- OT phrase interchangeability proves no law distinction

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (Abolished): E4 (three phrases for one document in Neh 8), E5 (Neh 10:29 bridge), E6 (2 Chr 34:14 bridge), E7 (Luke 2:22-24 interchange), E8 (Ezra 7:6, 10 interchange), E9 (Dan 9:11 interchange)
- AGAINST (Continues): E12 (Paul's "law of God" = Decalogue), E13 (Paul's "law of Moses" = civil regulation), E22 (entole not in "law of Moses" phrases), E23 (dogma not in "law of Moses" phrases); Master file: N001 (two delivery modes), N002 (two repositories), N011 (two authorships), N017 (shadow vocabulary exclusive to ceremonial), N018 (cessation vocabulary never for Decalogue)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E4 (Neh 8 three phrases) | Plain | Observable textual fact -- same book, three names |
| E5 (Neh 10:29) | Plain | Explicit bridging statement |
| E6 (2 Chr 34:14) | Plain | Explicit bridging statement |
| E7 (Luke 2:22-24) | Plain | Same-passage interchange |
| E12 (Paul's law of God = Decalogue) | Plain | Identified by 10th commandment in context |
| E13 (Paul's law of Moses = civil) | Plain | Direct quotation of Deu 25:4 |
| E22 (entole not in law of Moses) | Plain | Observable vocabulary distribution |
| N001 (two delivery modes) | Plain | Observable narrative fact |
| N002 (two repositories) | Plain | Observable narrative fact |
| N017 (shadow vocab exclusive to ceremonial) | Plain | Observable NT vocabulary pattern |
| N018 (cessation vocab never for Decalogue) | Plain | Observable NT vocabulary pattern |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
Both sides have Plain statements. The FOR side (Abolished) establishes that the phrases are interchangeable as labels for the same comprehensive document. The AGAINST side (Continues) establishes that within this same comprehensive document, the contents are internally differentiated by delivery mode, authorship, repository, vocabulary, and NT treatment. The interchangeability of the label does not address the internal structure of the contents.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The bridging passages (E4-E9) establish that the three phrases label the same body of law. This is undisputed. The internal-distinction passages (N001, N002, N017, N018) establish that within this body, the Decalogue is differentiated from the broader legislation. The claim that interchangeability of the comprehensive label proves no internal distinction requires an additional step: from "the labels are interchangeable" to "therefore the contents are undifferentiated." This additional step is not supported by the bridging passages themselves, which only address the label, not the internal structure.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong against the Abolished claim.**
The interchangeability of the phrases is a textual fact. But the claim that this proves no internal distinction within the law is not supported by the bridging passages, which address labels, not internal structure. Multiple prior E/N items (N001, N002, N011-N015, N017, N018) establish internal differentiation within the same comprehensive body. The FOR side proves the labels are interchangeable; the AGAINST side proves the contents are internally differentiated. These are not contradictory -- both can be true simultaneously.

#### I-B Resolution: I3 -- "Law of Moses" never exclusively references Decalogue, proving no separate identity

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (Abolished): E2 (no "law of Moses" occurrence identifies exclusively Decalogue content)
- AGAINST (Continues): E12 (Paul's "law of God" DOES identify the Decalogue specifically), E22 (entole vocabulary distinguishes moral commands), master file N001-N002, N011-N015 (multiple dimensions of Decalogue distinction)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E2 (no exclusive Decalogue reference) | Plain | Observable distributional fact |
| E12 (law of God = Decalogue) | Plain | Contextually identified |
| N001-N002 (delivery/repository distinction) | Plain | Observable narrative facts |
| N017-N018 (vocabulary distinctions) | Plain | Observable NT patterns |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
The FOR side has one Plain statement (E2): the phrase "law of Moses" is never used exclusively for the Decalogue. The AGAINST side has multiple Plain statements showing that the Decalogue IS distinguished within the broader body by other means (delivery, authorship, repository, naming, NT vocabulary). The absence of one specific phrasing does not negate the presence of multiple other distinguishing markers.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
E2 establishes that "the law of Moses" as a phrase is comprehensive. It does not establish that the Decalogue has no separate identity -- only that this particular phrase does not isolate it. The Decalogue's separate identity is established by other textual evidence (N001-N002, N011-N015).

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong against the Abolished claim.**
The absence of a specific "law of Moses = only the Decalogue" reference proves only that the phrase is comprehensive, not that its contents are undifferentiated. The Decalogue's distinct identity is established through multiple other textual markers.

## Verification Phase

### Step A: Verify Explicit Statements
- E1 through E23: Each directly quotes or closely paraphrases verse text, or states an observable vocabulary/distributional fact. All are the plain meaning of the words.
- No E-item states what a position infers; each states what the text says.

### Step A2: Verify Positional Classifications of E-items
- E12 is the only positional E-item (Continues). Tree 3 trace is documented above: passes all four gates. The referent is identified by the 10th commandment (Gate 1 PASS), grammar is unambiguous (Gate 2 PASS), genre is didactic epistle (Gate 3 PASS), and the classification is consistent with E010, E011, E046 in the master file (Gate 4 PASS).
- All other E-items are Neutral: they pass neither V1 (continuation vocabulary) nor V2 (cessation vocabulary) in Step 1 of Tree 3.

### Step B: Verify Necessary Implications
- N1: Follows unavoidably from three passages using all three phrases for the same book (E4, E5, E6). Any reader must accept this.
- N2: Follows unavoidably from Mal 4:4 ("I commanded him") and the multiple passages attributing divine authority while using the Mosaic label (E4, E5, E6, E10). Any reader must accept this.
- N3: Follows unavoidably from comparing Paul's contextually identified "law of God" (Rom 7:7) with the OT comprehensive "law of Moses" references. No interpretation required -- the identification is in the text.
- N4: Follows unavoidably from the ceremonial content cited under "law of the LORD" (E19). Any reader must accept this.
- N5: Follows unavoidably from the bridging formulas (E5, E6, E9, E10). Any reader must accept that Moses mediated and God authored.
- All N-items pass the three N-tier tests.

### Step C: Verify Inference Classifications (Source Test)
- I1: All components (Paul's "law of God," Paul's "law of Moses," vocabulary patterns) are in the E/N tables. Text-derived -> I-A or I-B.
- I2: All components are in the E/N tables. Text-derived -> I-A or I-B.
- I3: All components are in the E/N tables. Text-derived -> I-A or I-B.
- I4: All components are in the E/N tables. Text-derived -> I-A or I-B.
- I5: All components are in the E/N tables. Text-derived -> I-A or I-B.
- I6: Components include the council's ruling but add a concept (moral law released) not stated in the text. However, the primary issue is IP0 application -> Neutral.
- I7: Uses E/N data but adds the concept of indivisibility from a comprehensive label. The indivisibility concept overrides existing E/N items -> I-D.

### Step D: Verify Inference Classifications (Direction Test)
- I1: Does not require any E/N statement to mean other than its lexical value. -> I-A.
- I2: Requires the interchangeability (E4-E9) to mean "no internal distinction," which goes beyond the lexical value of "same book with three names." -> I-B.
- I3: Requires the absence of exclusive Decalogue reference (E2) to mean "no separate identity," which adds a concept -> I-B.
- I4: Does not require any E/N statement to mean other than its lexical value. -> I-A.
- I5: Does not require any E/N statement to mean other than its lexical value. -> I-A.
- I6: Reclassified as Neutral via IP0; the council dispute is about ceremonial requirements.
- I7: Requires overriding E053, E054, E143, N017, N018. -> I-D.

### Step E: Run Consistency Checks
- I1 (I-A): Requires only #5 (systematizing). PASS.
- I2 (I-B): Has E/N items on BOTH sides (bridging passages FOR; internal-distinction items AGAINST). PASS.
- I3 (I-B): Has E/N items on BOTH sides (E2 FOR; E12, N001, N002 AGAINST). PASS.
- I4 (I-A): Requires only #5. PASS.
- I5 (I-A): Requires only #5. PASS.
- I6: Neutral (IP0). N/A.
- I7 (I-D): Overrides E053, E054, E143, N017, N018. PASS.

### Step F: Verify SIS Connections
- I2 I-B resolution: documented above with full 5-step protocol.
- I3 I-B resolution: documented above with full 5-step protocol.
- No #4a connections claimed; all inferences use #5 or #2 + #5.

## Tally Summary

From this study:

```
- Explicit statements: 23
- Necessary implications: 5
- Inferences: 7
  - I-A (Evidence-Extending): 3 (I1, I4, I5)
  - I-B (Competing-Evidence): 2 (I2, I3) -- both resolved Strong against Abolished
  - I-C (Compatible External): 0
  - I-D (Counter-Evidence External): 1 (I7)
  - Neutral (IP0): 1 (I6)
```

By position:

| Tier | Continues | Abolished | Neutral | Total |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| E | 1 | 0 | 22 | 23 |
| N | 0 | 0 | 5 | 5 |
| I-A | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| I-B | 0 | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| I-D | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| Neutral I | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| **Total** | **4** | **3** | **28** | **35** |

Both I-B items (Abolished) were resolved Strong against the Abolished claim. The I-D item (I7, Abolished) requires overriding 5 existing E/N items from prior studies.

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies)

1. The phrase "the law of Moses" designates the comprehensive body of Pentateuchal legislation. It is not restricted to any single category (moral, ceremonial, or civil). [E1, E2, E3]
2. "Law of Moses," "law of God," and "law of the LORD" are used interchangeably for the same document in the OT. [E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, E9; N1]
3. Moses is the mediator/agent of the law; God is the source/author. The phrase "law of Moses" attributes mediation, not origination, to Moses. [E10, N2, N5]
4. Paul's "law of God" in Romans 7-8 is identified by the 10th commandment as the Decalogue/moral law. [E12; master E046]
5. Paul's "law of Moses" in 1 Corinthians 9:9 cites a civil regulation, not a Decalogue commandment. [E13]
6. The "law of the LORD" is used for both ceremonial and moral content. It is not restricted to the moral law. [E19, E20; N4]
7. Entole (commandment) is used in "commandments of God" phrases but not in "law of Moses" phrases in the NT. [E22]
8. The "law of Moses" could not accomplish justification (Acts 13:39). [E15]

## What CANNOT Be Said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture)

1. That "the law of Moses" refers exclusively to the ceremonial law. The comprehensive references (7 of 21) include all categories.
2. That "the law of Moses" refers exclusively to the moral law. No occurrence identifies exclusively Decalogue content.
3. That the interchangeability of the three phrases proves there is no internal distinction within the law. The labels address the same comprehensive body; the contents are internally differentiated by delivery, authorship, repository, naming, and NT vocabulary (established in prior studies).
4. That Paul's distinct usage of "law of God" vs. "law of Moses" constitutes an explicit theological theory of law categories. The pattern is observable but not explicitly articulated by Paul.
5. That the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15) released Gentile believers from the moral law. The dispute was about circumcision and ceremonial requirements; the moral law was not in dispute.
6. That because the "law of Moses" is comprehensive (including moral law), the moral law shares the same fate as the ceremonial law. This requires adding the concept of indivisibility, which is contradicted by multiple E/N items showing internal differentiation.
