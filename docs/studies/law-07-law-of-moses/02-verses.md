## A. All "Law of Moses" Occurrences (22 KJV hits; 21 law-code references + 1 "father in law of Moses")

### 1. Joshua 8:31 -- Ceremonial (altar-building, burnt offerings)
> **Joshua 8:28** And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.
> **Joshua 8:29** And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.
> **Joshua 8:30** Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,
> **Joshua 8:31** As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, **an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.**
> **Joshua 8:32** And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.
> **Joshua 8:33** And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites...
> **Joshua 8:34** And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
> **Joshua 8:35** There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel...

**Contextual note:** The specific content cited is altar-building instructions (cf. Deut 27:5-6) and burnt/peace offerings -- ceremonial content. The broader context (vv.34-35) includes "all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings" -- comprehensive.

### 2. Joshua 8:32 -- General/Comprehensive (copy of the law)
> **Joshua 8:32** And he wrote there upon the stones **a copy of the law of Moses**, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.

**Contextual note:** "A copy of the law" written on stones (cf. Deut 27:3,8). This is the entire law inscription, comprehensive.

### 3. Joshua 23:6 -- General/Comprehensive (all that is written)
> **Joshua 23:3** And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you...
> **Joshua 23:6** Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do **all that is written in the book of the law of Moses**, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;
> **Joshua 23:7** That ye come not among these nations... neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:
> **Joshua 23:8** But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.

**Contextual note:** "All that is written" -- comprehensive. The follow-up (v.7) references idolatry prohibitions, which span both moral (1st/2nd commandment) and broader legislation.

### 4. 1 Kings 2:3 -- General/Comprehensive (statutes, commandments, judgments, testimonies)
> **1 Kings 2:1** Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
> **1 Kings 2:2** I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;
> **1 Kings 2:3** And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep **his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies**, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:
> **1 Kings 2:4** That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me...

**Contextual note:** David's deathbed charge to Solomon uses the full four-term formula (statutes, commandments, judgments, testimonies) -- comprehensive, including all categories.

### 5. 2 Kings 14:6 -- Civil/Judicial (individual accountability for sin)
> **2 Kings 14:3** And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father...
> **2 Kings 14:5** And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.
> **2 Kings 14:6** But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded, saying, **The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.**
> **2 Kings 14:7** He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand...

**Contextual note:** Quotes Deut 24:16 -- a civil/judicial principle of individual criminal accountability. This is a mishpat (judgment/case law).

### 6. 2 Kings 23:25 -- General/Comprehensive (all the law of Moses)
> **2 Kings 23:24** Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations...did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.
> **2 Kings 23:25** And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to **all the law of Moses**; neither after him arose there any like him.
> **2 Kings 23:26** Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath...

**Contextual note:** "All the law of Moses" -- comprehensive. Josiah's reforms included both ceremonial (Passover, v.22-23) and moral (idolatry purge, v.24) content.

### 7. 2 Chronicles 23:18 -- Ceremonial (burnt offerings)
> **2 Chronicles 23:17** Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down...
> **2 Chronicles 23:18** Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites...to offer **the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses**, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.
> **2 Chronicles 23:19** And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD...

**Contextual note:** Specific content is burnt offerings -- ceremonial.

### 8. 2 Chronicles 30:16 -- Ceremonial (Passover blood-sprinkling)
> **2 Chronicles 30:15** Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month...
> **2 Chronicles 30:16** And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: **the priests sprinkled the blood**, which they received of the hand of the Levites.
> **2 Chronicles 30:17** For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified...

**Contextual note:** Passover blood-sprinkling procedures -- ceremonial.

### 9. Ezra 3:2 -- Ceremonial (altar-building, burnt offerings)
> **Ezra 3:1** And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.
> **Ezra 3:2** Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer **burnt offerings** thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
> **Ezra 3:3** And they set the altar upon his bases...and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening.
> **Ezra 3:4** They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written...

**Contextual note:** Altar-building and burnt offerings -- ceremonial.

### 10. Ezra 7:6 -- General/Comprehensive (Ezra as scribe in the law)
> **Ezra 7:6** This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was **a ready scribe in the law of Moses**, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him.
> **Ezra 7:7** And there went up some of the children of Israel...
> **Ezra 7:10** For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel **statutes and judgments**.

**Contextual note:** General reference to Ezra's expertise. Note v.6 says "which the LORD God of Israel had given" -- attributing the law to God while calling it "law of Moses." V.10 pairs "law of the LORD" with "statutes and judgments."

### 11. Nehemiah 8:1 -- General/Comprehensive (the book of the law of Moses)
> **Nehemiah 8:1** And all the people gathered themselves together as one man...and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring **the book of the law of Moses**, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.
> **Nehemiah 8:2** And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation...
> **Nehemiah 8:3** And he read therein before the street...from the morning until midday...
> **Nehemiah 8:8** So they read in the book in **the law of God** distinctly, and gave the sense...
> **Nehemiah 8:14** And they found written in **the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses**, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month
> **Nehemiah 8:18** Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in **the book of the law of God**...

**Contextual note:** This is a critical passage where "law of Moses" (v.1), "law of God" (v.8, v.18), and "the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses" (v.14) all describe the SAME BOOK being read. The specific content found is the Feast of Tabernacles (v.14) -- ceremonial. But the book itself is comprehensive.

### 12. Daniel 9:11 -- Covenant curses
> **Daniel 9:10** Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
> **Daniel 9:11** Yea, all Israel have transgressed **thy law**, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore **the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses** the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.
> **Daniel 9:12** And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us...

**Contextual note:** "The curse...and the oath" written in the law of Moses -- references the covenant curses (Deut 28-29; Lev 26). Note Daniel calls the same content "thy law" (God's law) in the first clause, then "the law of Moses" in the second clause.

### 13. Daniel 9:13 -- Covenant curses
> **Daniel 9:13** As it is written in the law of Moses, **all this evil is come upon us**: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.
> **Daniel 9:14** Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us...

**Contextual note:** Again covenant curses -- the evils/punishments for disobedience (Deut 28-30).

### 14. Malachi 4:4 -- General/Comprehensive (law with statutes and judgments)
> **Malachi 4:1** For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven...
> **Malachi 4:4** Remember ye **the law of Moses my servant**, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, **with the statutes and judgments**.
> **Malachi 4:5** Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:
> **Malachi 4:6** And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children...

**Contextual note:** God Himself speaks, calling it "the law of Moses my servant" -- Moses is the servant/mediator; God is the commander ("which **I** commanded unto him"). The addition of "with the statutes and judgments" (chuqqim u'mishpatim) broadens the reference to comprehensive. Hebrew parsing confirms: towrat Mosheh (instruction of Moses) + chuqqim (statutes) + mishpatim (judgments).

### 15. Luke 2:22 -- Ceremonial (purification after childbirth)
> **Luke 2:21** And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS...
> **Luke 2:22** And when the days of her purification according to **the law of Moses** were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;
> **Luke 2:23** (As it is written in **the law of the Lord**, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)
> **Luke 2:24** And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in **the law of the Lord**, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
> **Luke 2:25** And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon...

**Contextual note:** CRITICAL PASSAGE. "Law of Moses" (v.22) = purification (Lev 12) -- ceremonial. "Law of the Lord" (v.23) = firstborn presentation (Exod 13:2) -- ceremonial. "Law of the Lord" (v.24) = sacrifice offering (Lev 12:8) -- ceremonial. Both phrases are used for ceremonial content IN THE SAME PASSAGE. This shows that "law of Moses" and "law of the Lord" can reference the same body of legislation.

### 16. Luke 24:44 -- Literary/Pentateuch reference
> **Luke 24:44** And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in **the law of Moses**, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.
> **Luke 24:45** Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
> **Luke 24:46** And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:

**Contextual note:** "Law of Moses, prophets, psalms" = the three divisions of the Hebrew Bible (Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim). Here "law of Moses" = the Pentateuch as a literary unit.

### 17. John 7:23 -- Ceremonial (circumcision)
> **John 7:21** Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.
> **John 7:22** Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
> **John 7:23** If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that **the law of Moses** should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
> **John 7:24** Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.

**Contextual note:** Circumcision -- ceremonial. Jesus notes circumcision "is not of Moses, but of the fathers" (Gen 17), yet calls the requirement "the law of Moses."

### 18. Acts 13:39 -- Justification context (what the law could not do)
> **Acts 13:38** Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:
> **Acts 13:39** And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by **the law of Moses**.
> **Acts 13:40** Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;

**Contextual note:** Paul contrasts justification by faith with justification by "the law of Moses." The referent here could be comprehensive (the entire Mosaic system) or specifically the ceremonial system (sacrifices could not truly justify). The Greek uses "nomos Mouseos" (G3551 + G3475).

### 19. Acts 15:5 -- Ceremonial (circumcision and law-keeping)
> **Acts 15:4** And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church...
> **Acts 15:5** But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to **circumcise** them, and to command them to keep **the law of Moses**.
> **Acts 15:6** And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.
> **Acts 15:7** And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up...
> **Acts 15:24** Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be **circumcised**, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:
> **Acts 15:28-29** For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication...

**Contextual note:** The specific issue is circumcision (v.5) -- ceremonial. The Jerusalem council's ruling (vv.28-29) addresses ceremonial matters (meats, blood, strangled things) plus fornication (moral).

### 20. Acts 28:23 -- Literary/Pentateuch reference
> **Acts 28:22** But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
> **Acts 28:23** And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of **the law of Moses**, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.
> **Acts 28:24** And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.

**Contextual note:** "Law of Moses...and the prophets" = the two-part division of the OT. Paul uses the Pentateuch as a literary source to teach about Jesus.

### 21. 1 Corinthians 9:9 -- Civil/Agricultural (muzzling the ox)
> **1 Corinthians 9:7** Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof?
> **1 Corinthians 9:8** Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
> **1 Corinthians 9:9** For it is written in **the law of Moses**, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?
> **1 Corinthians 9:10** Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written...

**Contextual note:** Quotes Deut 25:4 -- an agricultural regulation (civil/practical). Paul applies a principle from "the law of Moses" to support apostolic rights. The Greek uses "en...to Mouseos nomo" (in the Moses law).

### 22. Hebrews 10:28 -- Civil/Judicial (death penalty for law-despisers)
> **Hebrews 10:26** For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
> **Hebrews 10:27** But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
> **Hebrews 10:28** He that despised **Moses' law** died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
> **Hebrews 10:29** Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God...

**Contextual note:** "Moses' law" (nomon Mouseos) -- the judicial penalty of death for blasphemy/apostasy under the witness requirement (Deut 17:6). The author uses this as a lesser-to-greater argument. The content is civil/judicial (witness requirement and death penalty).

### Non-law-code reference (excluded from classification):
> **Judges 4:11** Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the **father in law of Moses**, had severed himself from the Kenites...

---

## B. All "Law of God" Occurrences (7 in KJV)

### 1. Joshua 24:26
> **Joshua 24:25** So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
> **Joshua 24:26** And Joshua wrote these words in **the book of the law of God**, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.
> **Joshua 24:27** And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us...

**Contextual note:** Joshua appends his words to "the book of the law of God" -- the same document elsewhere called "the book of the law of Moses."

### 2. Nehemiah 8:8
> **Nehemiah 8:8** So they read in the book in **the law of God** distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.

**Contextual note:** Same book that v.1 calls "the book of the law of Moses." The phrases are interchangeable for the same document.

### 3. Nehemiah 8:18
> **Nehemiah 8:18** Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in **the book of the law of God**. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.

**Contextual note:** Same reading context as Neh 8:1 ("law of Moses"). The specific content discovered was the Feast of Tabernacles (v.14) -- ceremonial.

### 4. Nehemiah 10:28-29
> **Nehemiah 10:28** And the rest of the people...and all they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands unto **the law of God**...
> **Nehemiah 10:29** They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in **God's law, which was given by Moses** the servant of God, and to observe and do all **the commandments of the LORD** our Lord, and **his judgments and his statutes**;
> **Nehemiah 10:30** And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land...
> **Nehemiah 10:31** And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day...

**Contextual note:** CRITICAL BRIDGING VERSE. V.29 explicitly states "God's law, which was given by Moses" -- connecting "God's law" with "by Moses." Then adds "the commandments of the LORD...his judgments and his statutes." The content mentioned (v.30-31) includes intermarriage prohibition and sabbath-keeping -- combining moral and civil elements.

### 5. Romans 7:22
> **Romans 7:19** For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
> **Romans 7:22** For I delight in **the law of God** after the inward man:
> **Romans 7:23** But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind...
> **Romans 7:25** I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve **the law of God**; but with the flesh the law of sin.

**Contextual note:** Paul's "law of God" in Romans 7 is identified earlier in the chapter by the 10th commandment: "Thou shalt not covet" (v.7). The "law of God" here = the Decalogue/moral law. Paul delights in it and serves it with his mind.

### 6. Romans 7:25 (same passage as above)
See Romans 7:22 context above. "With the mind I myself serve the law of God."

### 7. Romans 8:7
> **Romans 8:4** That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
> **Romans 8:5** For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh...
> **Romans 8:7** Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to **the law of God**, neither indeed can be.
> **Romans 8:8** So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

**Contextual note:** "The law of God" is the standard to which the carnal mind cannot submit. Same context as Romans 7 -- the referent is the moral law (identified by the 10th commandment in 7:7).

---

## C. All "Law of the LORD" Occurrences (19 in KJV, including Exod 13:9 "LORD's law")

### 1. Exodus 13:9
> **Exodus 13:7** Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days...
> **Exodus 13:8** And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.
> **Exodus 13:9** And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that **the LORD's law** may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.

**Contextual note:** "The LORD's law" in context of unleavened bread/Passover commemoration -- ceremonial context, but the phrase "the LORD's law...in thy mouth" suggests comprehensive instruction.

### 2. 2 Kings 10:31
> **2 Kings 10:30** And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes...
> **2 Kings 10:31** But Jehu took no heed to walk in **the law of the LORD God of Israel** with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.
> **2 Kings 10:32** In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short...

**Contextual note:** The specific failure is the golden calves (idolatry) -- a moral law violation (1st/2nd commandment).

### 3. 1 Chronicles 16:40
> **1 Chronicles 16:40** To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in **the law of the LORD**, which he commanded Israel;

**Contextual note:** Burnt offerings -- ceremonial content, described as "written in the law of the LORD."

### 4. 1 Chronicles 22:12
> **1 Chronicles 22:12** Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep **the law of the LORD thy God**.

**Contextual note:** General/comprehensive.

### 5. 2 Chronicles 12:1
> **2 Chronicles 12:1** And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook **the law of the LORD**, and all Israel with him.

**Contextual note:** General -- forsaking God's law comprehensively.

### 6. 2 Chronicles 17:9
> **2 Chronicles 17:9** And they taught in Judah, and had **the book of the law of the LORD** with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.

**Contextual note:** "The book of the law of the LORD" -- the same document.

### 7. 2 Chronicles 31:3
> **2 Chronicles 31:3** He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings...and for the set feasts, as it is written in **the law of the LORD**.

**Contextual note:** Burnt offerings and set feasts -- ceremonial content, called "the law of the LORD."

### 8. 2 Chronicles 31:4
> **2 Chronicles 31:4** Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in **the law of the LORD**.

**Contextual note:** Priestly portions/tithes -- ceremonial/civil.

### 9. 2 Chronicles 34:14
> **2 Chronicles 34:14** And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found **a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses**.
> **2 Chronicles 34:15** And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD...

**Contextual note:** CRITICAL BRIDGING VERSE. "The law of the LORD given by Moses" -- explicitly connects both phrases for the SAME DOCUMENT.

### 10. 2 Chronicles 35:26
> **2 Chronicles 35:26** Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in **the law of the LORD**,

**Contextual note:** General/comprehensive.

### 11. Ezra 7:10
> **Ezra 7:10** For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek **the law of the LORD**, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.

**Contextual note:** Ezra's expertise -- the same Ezra described in 7:6 as "a ready scribe in the law of Moses." The phrases are used interchangeably for the same body of knowledge.

### 12. Nehemiah 9:3
> **Nehemiah 9:3** And they stood up in their place, and read in **the book of the law of the LORD their God** one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.

**Contextual note:** The same book as Neh 8:1 ("law of Moses") and 8:8 ("law of God"). Three phrases for one document.

### 13. Psalm 1:2
> **Psalm 1:1** Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
> **Psalm 1:2** But his delight is in **the law of the LORD**; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
> **Psalm 1:3** And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water...

**Contextual note:** Devotional/wisdom context. "The law of the LORD" as the object of righteous meditation.

### 14. Psalm 19:7
> **Psalm 19:7** **The law of the LORD** is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
> **Psalm 19:8** The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.
> **Psalm 19:9** The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.

**Contextual note:** Six law-terms used (torah, eduth, piqqudim, mitsvah, yirah, mishpat). "The law of the LORD" is described as "perfect" -- devotional/attribute language.

### 15. Psalm 119:1
> **Psalm 119:1** Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in **the law of the LORD**.

**Contextual note:** Opening of the great acrostic psalm on God's law.

### 16. Isaiah 5:24
> **Isaiah 5:24** Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble...so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away **the law of the LORD of hosts**, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

**Contextual note:** General -- forsaking God's law leads to judgment.

### 17. Isaiah 30:9
> **Isaiah 30:9** That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear **the law of the LORD**:

**Contextual note:** General -- refusing to hear God's instruction.

### 18. Jeremiah 8:8
> **Jeremiah 8:8** How do ye say, We are wise, and **the law of the LORD** is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.

**Contextual note:** The scribes' false claim to possess God's law.

### 19. Hosea 4:6 (variant: "law of thy God")
> **Hosea 4:6** My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten **the law of thy God**, I will also forget thy children.

**Contextual note:** "The law of thy God" -- the priests have forgotten God's instruction.

### 20. Amos 2:4
> **Amos 2:4** Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised **the law of the LORD**, and have not kept **his commandments**, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:

**Contextual note:** "Despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments" -- parallel construction linking "law of the LORD" with "his commandments."

### 21. Luke 2:23-24
> **Luke 2:23** (As it is written in **the law of the Lord**, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)
> **Luke 2:24** And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in **the law of the Lord**, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.

**Contextual note:** See Luke 2:22 above. Same passage uses "law of Moses" (v.22) and "law of the Lord" (v.23-24) for the same legislation.
