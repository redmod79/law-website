## Question

What does "the law of Moses" refer to -- moral, ceremonial, or both? Classify all 22 occurrences of "law of Moses" by identifiable content (what specific laws or law-type does the context reference?). Examine Paul's usage of "law of God" vs "law of Moses" -- does he treat them as the same body of law or distinguish them? Compare with "law of the LORD" occurrences to determine whether these phrases are synonymous or carry distinct referents.

### The 21 "Law of Moses" Occurrences to Classify

Each occurrence must be examined in context and classified by what specific law-content the passage references:

| # | Verse | Testament | Context Category (to determine) |
|---|-------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| 1 | Josh 8:31 | OT | Altar-building instructions |
| 2 | Josh 8:32 | OT | Writing the law on stones |
| 3 | Josh 23:6 | OT | General obedience command |
| 4 | 1 Ki 2:3 | OT | David's charge to Solomon |
| 5 | 2 Ki 14:6 | OT | "Fathers shall not die for children" |
| 6 | 2 Ki 23:25 | OT | Josiah's wholehearted turn to the LORD |
| 7 | 2 Chr 23:18 | OT | Burnt offerings as written in the law |
| 8 | 2 Chr 30:16 | OT | Sprinkling of blood per the law |
| 9 | Ezra 3:2 | OT | Building the altar, burnt offerings |
| 10 | Ezra 7:6 | OT | Ezra as scribe skilled in the law |
| 11 | Neh 8:1 | OT | Public reading of the law |
| 12 | Dan 9:11 | OT | Curse and oath written in the law |
| 13 | Dan 9:13 | OT | "As it is written in the law of Moses" |
| 14 | Mal 4:4 | OT | "Remember the law of Moses...statutes and judgments" |
| 15 | Luke 2:22 | NT | Purification rites |
| 16 | Luke 24:44 | NT | "All things written in the law of Moses, prophets, psalms" |
| 17 | John 7:23 | NT | Circumcision on the sabbath |
| 18 | Acts 13:39 | NT | Justification not by "the law of Moses" |
| 19 | Acts 15:5 | NT | Pharisees insisting on circumcision and law-keeping |
| 20 | Acts 28:23 | NT | Paul persuading from "the law of Moses and the prophets" |
| 21 | 1 Cor 9:9 | NT | "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox" |
| 22 | Heb 10:28 | NT | Punishment under Moses' law (two or three witnesses) |

**Note**: The KJV shows 22 hits for "law of Moses" but one (Judges 4:11) is "father in law of Moses" -- not a reference to the law-code. The actual law-code references number 21 (Josh 8:31 and 8:32 are separate verses). The user's question says "22 occurrences" so count both Joshua 8 verses separately (21 verses, but user may count "Josh 8:31-32" as one unit making 20 passages with 21 verses). The research agent should verify the exact count and classify all of them.

### "Law of God" Occurrences (7 in KJV)

These must be compared with "law of Moses" to determine whether they share the same referent:

| Verse | Context (to examine) |
|-------|---------------------|
| Josh 24:26 | Joshua wrote in "the book of the law of God" |
| Neh 8:8 | Read in "the book of the law of God" distinctly |
| Neh 8:18 | Read in "the book of the law of God" day by day |
| Neh 10:29 | Walk in "God's law, which was given by Moses" |
| Rom 7:22 | Paul delights in "the law of God" after the inward man |
| Rom 7:25 | Paul serves "the law of God" with the mind |
| Rom 8:7 | Carnal mind not subject to "the law of God" |

**Critical**: Neh 10:29 explicitly connects "God's law" with "given by Moses" -- research agent must examine whether this equates the two phrases or whether context shows distinction. Rom 7:22-25 and 8:7 are Paul's own usage of "law of God" -- compare with his usage of "law of Moses" in 1 Cor 9:9.

### "Law of the LORD" Occurrences (18 in KJV)

These must be compared for overlap/distinction with both "law of Moses" and "law of God":

| Verse | Context (to examine) |
|-------|---------------------|
| Exod 13:9 | After Passover/unleavened bread instructions |
| 2 Ki 10:31 | Jehu's failure to walk in "the law of the LORD" |
| 1 Chr 16:40 | Burnt offerings on the altar "as written in the law of the LORD" |
| 2 Chr 12:1 | Rehoboam forsook "the law of the LORD" |
| 2 Chr 17:9 | Teaching with "the book of the law of the LORD" |
| 2 Chr 31:3 | King's contribution for burnt offerings "as written in the law of the LORD" |
| 2 Chr 31:4 | Tithes to encourage priests in "the law of the LORD" |
| 2 Chr 34:14 | Hilkiah found "a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses" |
| 2 Chr 35:26 | Josiah's acts "according to that which was written in the law of the LORD" |
| Ezra 7:10 | Ezra prepared his heart to seek "the law of the LORD" |
| Neh 9:3 | Read in "the book of the law of the LORD their God" |
| Psa 1:2 | Delight in "the law of the LORD"; meditate day and night |
| Psa 19:7 | "The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul" |
| Isa 5:24 | Cast away "the law of the LORD of hosts" |
| Isa 30:9 | People that will not hear "the law of the LORD" |
| Jer 8:8 | "The law of the LORD is with us" |
| Hos 4:6 | "Thou hast forgotten the law of thy God" (variant) |
| Amos 2:4 | Despised "the law of the LORD" |
| Luke 2:23-24 | Presentation/purification "as it is written in the law of the Lord" |

**Critical**: 2 Chr 34:14 uses "the law of the LORD given by Moses" -- explicitly connecting the two phrases. Compare with Luke 2:22-24 where "law of Moses" (v.22) and "law of the Lord" (v.23-24) appear in the same passage. Do they refer to the same thing? Research agent must analyze this carefully.

### Related Existing Studies

| Study | Score | Relevance |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| law-of-moses | 0.758 | **Highly relevant** -- A prior standalone study on the same topic. Research agent should read its CONCLUSION.md if it exists. |
| law-05 (civil-judicial-laws) | 0.651 | Established mishpatim as Decalogue applications; threefold division framework |
| ceremonial-laws | 0.650 | Pre-series ceremonial law study |
| law-04 (ceremonial-laws) | 0.623 | Established shadow/type vocabulary; cessation vocabulary (dogma) exclusively ceremonial |
| law-01 (gods-moral-law) | 0.618 | Established 7 unique Decalogue markers; moral law attributes |
| law-02 (law-before-sinai) | 0.594 | Moral law predates Sinai; Gen 26:5 |
| law-03 (exodus-20-vs-later-laws) | 0.586 | 5 dimensions of distinction between Decalogue and later laws |
| law-06 (hebrew-law-vocabulary) | 0.558 | Hebrew terms describe formal character, not moral categories |

**Key findings from prior series studies** (summarized for context):
1. **law-01**: The Decalogue has 7 unique markers distinguishing it from all other laws (spoken by God directly, written by God's finger, placed inside the ark, called "the testimony/eduth," prefaced with "I am the LORD thy God," given no mediator, and "he added no more"). 46 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items found.
2. **law-03**: Five dimensions of distinction between Exodus 20 content and subsequent legislation: delivery mode, authorship, repository, naming conventions, boundary marker ("he added no more").
3. **law-04**: Cessation vocabulary (dogma, cheirographon) is never applied to the Decalogue or nomos/entole in the NT. Shadow/type vocabulary is exclusively applied to ceremonial items. 1 Cor 7:19 ("Circumcision is nothing... but the keeping of the commandments of God") separates ceremonial from moral.
4. **law-05**: Mishpatim function as case-law applications of Decalogue principles. The threefold division (moral/ceremonial/civil) is classified as I-C (compatible external framework, not explicitly stated in Scripture).
5. **law-06**: Hebrew law terms (torah, mitsvah, chuqqah, mishpat, eduth, etc.) describe formal character (instruction, command, boundary, ruling, testimony) rather than moral categories. However, eduth has exclusive Decalogue association in narrative contexts.

### Focus Areas

Derived from tool discoveries, the research agent should investigate these specific questions:

1. **Contextual classification of each "law of Moses" occurrence**: For each of the 21 verses, what specific law-content does the surrounding context identify? Is it referencing ceremonial content (sacrifices, purification, circumcision), moral content (commandments, justice principles), civil content (judicial penalties), or is it a general/comprehensive reference to the entire Mosaic corpus?

2. **"Law of Moses" vs "law of God" in Paul**: Paul uses "law of God" in Rom 7:22, 25 and 8:7, and "law of Moses" in 1 Cor 9:9. Does Paul use these interchangeably or with distinct referents? What specific content does each phrase point to in its context?

3. **The Neh 10:29 / 2 Chr 34:14 bridge**: These verses explicitly connect "law of God" or "law of the LORD" with Moses. Do they prove synonymy, or does the phrase "given by Moses" describe the mediation channel while preserving a distinction about the ultimate Author?

4. **Luke 2:22-24 convergence**: Both "law of Moses" (v.22) and "law of the Lord" (v.23-24) appear in the same passage about purification/presentation. Are they parallel names for the same body of law, or do they reference distinct elements within the law-code?

5. **Malachi 4:4 and the compound phrase**: "Remember ye the law of Moses my servant... with the statutes and judgments." Does the addition of "statutes and judgments" indicate that "law of Moses" here means the entire Pentateuchal legislation?

6. **Pattern analysis**: Do OT uses of "law of Moses" tend to reference ceremonial/ritual content more frequently than moral content? Do NT uses show a different pattern? What does this distribution tell us about the phrase's referent?

7. **Positional implications**: Under the law-series methodology, does evidence show that "law of Moses" refers to a specific subset of laws (supporting the Continues position that the Bible distinguishes law-categories), or does it refer to the entire undivided law-code (supporting the Abolished position that law is a unified package)?
