# Verse Analysis

## Question
What does telos (G5056) mean in Romans 10:4? Termination, goal/purpose, or fulfillment?

---

## Central Word Study: Telos (G5056)

### Semantic Range from All 42 NT Occurrences

The word telos appears 42 times in the NT. Its root, tello, means "to set out for a definite point or goal." The complete semantic range, categorized by sense:

| Sense | Count | % | Representative Verses |
|-------|-------|---|----------------------|
| Eschatological end (end of the age) | 8 | 19% | Mat 24:6, 14; Mar 13:7, 13; Luk 21:9; 1 Cor 15:24; 1 Pet 4:7 |
| Outcome/result/consequence | 8 | 19% | Rom 6:21, 22; 2 Cor 11:15; Php 3:19; Heb 6:8; 1 Pet 1:9; 4:17; Jas 5:11 |
| Perseverance ("unto the end") | 9 | 21% | Mat 10:22; 26:58; Jhn 13:1; 1 Cor 1:8; 2 Cor 1:13; Heb 3:6, 14; 6:11; Rev 2:26 |
| Cessation/ending | 4 | 10% | Mar 3:26; Luk 1:33; 22:37; Heb 7:3 |
| Cosmic Alpha-Omega | 3 | 7% | Rev 1:8; 21:6; 22:13 |
| Tax/custom/toll | 3 | 7% | Mat 17:25; Rom 13:7 (x2) |
| Goal/purpose/aim | 1-2 | 2-5% | 1 Tim 1:5; Rom 10:4 (disputed) |
| Spatial extent | 3 | 7% | 1 Cor 10:11; 1 Th 2:16; Luk 18:5 |
| Ambiguous | 1 | 2% | 2 Cor 3:13 |

### Key Observation: Cessation Is a Minority Sense

The "termination/cessation" sense accounts for only 4 of 42 occurrences (10%). Three of these four are straightforward: a kingdom ending (Mar 3:26), Christ's kingdom having no end (Luk 1:33, which uses it in negation), and life ending (Heb 7:3). The fourth, Luke 22:37, refers to prophetic fulfillment-completion ("the things concerning me have an end"). None of these four involve law or commandments.

The majority of occurrences fall into the outcome/result and perseverance categories. The outcome/result sense (what something leads to, what something produces) is highly relevant to the Rom 10:4 question. When Paul himself uses telos in Romans, outside of 10:4, he uses it in the outcome/result sense:
- Rom 6:21: "the end of those things is death" (outcome)
- Rom 6:22: "the end everlasting life" (outcome)
- Rom 13:7: "custom to whom custom" (tax/toll sense)

### The Telos Word Family

| Strong's | Word | Meaning | NT Count |
|----------|------|---------|----------|
| [G5056](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5056/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | telos | end, goal, purpose | 42 |
| [G5055](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5055/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | teleo | to end, complete, execute | 26 |
| [G5048](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5048/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | teleioo | to complete, accomplish, perfect | 24 |
| [G5046](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5046/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | teleios | complete, perfect, mature | 19 |
| [G5051](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5051/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | teleiotes | completer, finisher | 1 (Heb 12:2) |

The word family consistently carries the sense of completion, maturity, and reaching an objective. In Heb 12:2, Jesus is the teleiotes (G5051) of faith -- the completer/perfecter of faith, not the terminator of faith. This is directly analogous to the Rom 10:4 question: is Christ the one who terminates the law, or the one who is the goal the law was always pointing toward?

## Expanding Circles of Context for Romans 10:4

### Circle 1: The Verse Itself

> **Romans 10:4** — "For Christ is the end [telos] of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."

**Grammar and syntax:**
```
telos        gar    nomou     Christos  eis dikaiosynen  panti to pisteuonti
[end/goal]   for    of-law    Christ    for-righteousness to-every the believing
Nom.Sg.N     CONJ   Gen.Sg.M  Nom.Sg.M  PREP+Acc.Sg.F   Dat.Sg.M  Dat.Sg.M
```

Key observations from the verse itself:
1. **The conjunction "gar" (for):** This is an explanatory conjunction. The verse explains what precedes it (10:1-3). It is not introducing a new topic; it is grounding an existing argument.
2. **Telos + genitive noun (nomou):** The construction "telos of X" requires contextual determination. The same construction in 1 Tim 1:5 means "goal/purpose of X."
3. **The qualifier "eis dikaiosynen" (for righteousness):** This limits the scope. The statement is not about the law in general. It is about the law's relationship to righteousness specifically. Christ is the telos of the law *for the purpose of righteousness*.
4. **"Panti to pisteuonti" (to every one that believeth):** This further qualifies the statement. The telos operates for everyone who believes. This connects to Paul's theme of faith-righteousness versus works-righteousness, not to the question of whether the law exists or ceases.
5. **Nomos is anarthrous** (without the article): Paul uses nomos both with and without the article in Romans, and the articular/anarthrous pattern does not reliably determine which sense of nomos Paul intends (N103). Context must determine the referent.

### Circle 2: Immediate Context — Romans 10:1-8

The explanatory "gar" in 10:4 connects directly to 10:1-3:

- **10:1:** Paul's heart desire is that Israel "might be saved."
- **10:2:** Israel has "a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge."
- **10:3:** "For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."
- **10:4:** "**For** [explaining v.3] Christ is the telos of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."

Paul's subject is Israel's failure to attain righteousness. Israel had zeal but lacked knowledge. They were ignorant of God's righteousness. They were going about to establish their own righteousness instead of submitting to God's righteousness. The "for" in v.4 explains why their project was misguided: Christ is the telos of the law for righteousness.

If telos = "termination," the logic would be: Israel was wrong to pursue law-righteousness because Christ terminated the law. But this reading has a problem: Paul does not say the law was wrong; he says Israel's *method* was wrong. They pursued it "not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law" (9:32). The law itself was not the obstacle; their approach to it was.

If telos = "goal/purpose," the logic is: Israel was wrong to establish their own righteousness because they failed to see that Christ is the goal/purpose the law was always pointing to for righteousness. They were so busy trying to earn righteousness by works that they missed the one the law was pointing to.

**Critically, verses 5-8 confirm the "goal" reading:**

- **10:5:** "For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them." Paul quotes Lev 18:5 as describing law-righteousness (the works-based approach).
- **10:6-8:** "But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise..." Paul then quotes **Deuteronomy 30:12-14** and identifies it as "the righteousness which is of faith" speaking. The Torah itself teaches faith-righteousness. Moses' own law contains the message of faith-righteousness.

This is decisive for the "goal" reading: If the law itself (Deuteronomy 30) teaches faith-righteousness, then the law was always pointing to faith in Christ. Christ is the goal the law was leading toward. If the law were simply terminated, Paul's appeal to the Torah as teaching faith-righteousness would be incoherent -- why cite a terminated document as authoritative support for faith?

### Circle 3: Chapter Context — Romans 9:30-10:21

The broader section (Rom 9:30-10:21) contrasts two approaches to righteousness:

- **9:30:** Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained it -- by faith.
- **9:31-32:** Israel pursued a "law of righteousness" but failed because they sought it by works, not by faith. They stumbled at the stumbling-stone (Christ).
- **9:33:** The stumbling-stone is prophesied in Isaiah 28:16: "whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
- **10:3-4:** Israel's ignorance of God's righteousness, seeking their own instead. Christ is the telos of the law for righteousness.
- **10:5-8:** Two descriptions of righteousness: law-works (Lev 18:5) vs. faith (Deut 30:12-14).
- **10:9-13:** Salvation by confession and belief, available to all without distinction.

The entire argument is about the *method* of attaining righteousness (faith vs. works), not about whether the law exists or has been terminated. Paul's concern is Israel's misuse of the law (trying to earn righteousness by works) versus the law's actual purpose (pointing to Christ as the source of righteousness by faith).

### Circle 4: Book Context — Romans as a Whole

Three passages in the same epistle are critical:

**Romans 3:31:** "Do we then make void [katargoumen] the law through faith? God forbid [me genoito]: yea, we establish [histanomen] the law."

This is the strongest constraint on the reading of Rom 10:4 within the same epistle. Paul uses the strongest possible Greek negation (me genoito -- "may it never be!") to deny that faith makes the law void. The verb katargeo means "to render idle, make void, abolish." Paul emphatically denies this is what faith does to the law. Instead, faith *establishes* (histemi) the law.

If telos in 10:4 meant "termination" -- Christ terminated the law -- this would directly contradict 3:31. The same author, in the same epistle, would be saying both "we establish the law" and "the law is terminated." This is not a case where different contexts make different statements possible; both passages address the relationship between faith and the law.

**Romans 7:12, 14:** "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (v.12). "The law is spiritual" (v.14).

Paul affirms the moral character of the law using present-tense verbs. The law *is* (not "was") holy, just, good, and spiritual. In context (7:7-14), Paul identifies the law by quoting the tenth commandment (Thou shalt not covet), firmly placing the Decalogue as his referent.

**Romans 8:4:** "That the righteousness [dikaioma] of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."

The stated purpose of God sending His Son (8:3) is that the law's righteous requirement might be fulfilled *in believers*. The law's dikaioma is not abolished but fulfilled in those who walk by the Spirit. This is consistent with telos = "goal": Christ is the goal of the law for righteousness, and that righteousness is now fulfilled in believers through the Spirit.

**Romans 13:8-10:** Paul quotes five Decalogue commandments (adultery, murder, theft, false witness, covetousness) as the specific content that love fulfills. The law-content love fulfills is moral law (the Decalogue), not ceremonial law. If the law had been terminated in 10:4, citing its commandments as still operative in 13:8-10 would be contradictory.

### Circle 5: Same Author — 1 Timothy 1:5 (The Decisive Parallel)

> **1 Timothy 1:5** — "Now the end [telos] of the commandment [paraggelia] is charity [agape] out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned."

**Greek structure comparison:**

| Element | Romans 10:4 | 1 Timothy 1:5 |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Construction | telos + genitive (nomou) = predicate | to telos + genitive (tes paraggelias) = predicate |
| Subject | telos (end/goal) | to telos (the end/goal) |
| Genitive modifier | nomou (of law) | tes paraggelias (of the commandment) |
| Predicate | Christos (Christ) | agape (love) |
| Additional qualifier | eis dikaiosynen panti to pisteuonti | ek katharas kardias... |

The syntactic pattern is identical: **telos + genitive of a law/commandment term = a nominative predicate**.

In 1 Tim 1:5, the meaning is unambiguous. "The telos of the commandment is love." No one reads this as "the commandment is terminated by love" or "love brings the commandment to cessation." The commandment's *goal* and *purpose* is love.

The immediate context confirms this beyond doubt:
- **1 Tim 1:7:** Some desire to be "teachers of the law" but do not understand it.
- **1 Tim 1:8:** "We know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully."
- **1 Tim 1:9-10:** Paul lists violations of the Decalogue (murderers, whoremongers, menstealers, liars, perjured persons) as what the law addresses.

The law is not terminated. It is good. It has a proper use. Its goal/purpose (telos) is love from a pure heart. This is the same Paul writing the same construction about the same subject (the law/commandment). The SIS connection is verified by: (a) same author, (b) identical syntactic construction, (c) same semantic domain (law/commandment + telos).

### Circle 5b: Same Author — Galatians 3:24

> **Galatians 3:24** — "Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [paidagogos] to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith."

The law as paidagogos "unto Christ" (eis Christon). The preposition eis is ambiguous between directional ("unto/toward Christ" = goal) and temporal ("until Christ came" = temporal termination point). However:

1. The purpose clause "hina ek pisteos dikaiothomen" (that we might be justified by faith) connects the paidagogos function to the goal of justification by faith. The law's function was to lead toward faith-justification.
2. In Gal 3:21, Paul states: "Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid." The law is not opposed to the promises. If the law were simply a temporary measure to be discarded, the denial would be weaker.
3. The paidagogos was not a teacher but a slave-guardian who supervised children and enforced discipline. "No longer under a paidagogos" means a change of *status* (mature heir vs. supervised minor), not a change of *moral standards*. A grown adult who no longer has a guardian is still bound by the same moral standards the guardian enforced.

### Circle 6: Other Authors

**1 Peter 1:9:** "Receiving the end [telos] of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."

The telos of faith is salvation. Faith is not terminated by salvation; salvation is the *outcome/goal* of faith. This supports the "goal/outcome" sense of telos.

**Hebrews 12:2:** "Looking unto Jesus the author [archegos] and finisher [teleiotes] of our faith."

Jesus is the teleiotes of faith -- the perfecter/completer. He does not terminate faith; he brings it to its intended completion. Teleiotes is from the same root as telos.

**Matthew 5:17:** "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."

Jesus explicitly denies coming to destroy (kataluo) the law. He uses a double negative ("think not... I am not come to destroy"). He came to fulfill (pleroo), which in the immediate context (Mat 5:18-19) is confirmed as magnifying and deepening the law, not terminating it. *(Examined in depth in law-12-matthew-5-17-20.)*

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Romans 10:4

**Context:** Paul is explaining why Israel failed to attain righteousness despite their zeal (10:1-3). The "for" (gar) connects to v.3: Israel was ignorant of God's righteousness and sought to establish their own.

**Direct statement:** "Christ is the end [telos] of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."

**Key observations:**
1. The verse uses telos (G5056), which has a semantic range including termination, goal, purpose, and outcome.
2. The qualifier "for righteousness" (eis dikaiosynen) limits the scope to the law's relationship with righteousness, not the law's existence.
3. The qualifier "to every one that believeth" connects to the faith-vs-works theme of the preceding argument.
4. The explanatory "gar" ties this to Israel's pursuit of their own righteousness (v.3).
5. The identical syntactic pattern in 1 Tim 1:5 (same author) yields unambiguous "goal/purpose" meaning.
6. Paul quotes the law (Deut 30:12-14) in the immediately following verses (10:6-8) as teaching faith-righteousness, which presupposes the law's ongoing authority.
7. In the same epistle, Paul emphatically denies faith makes the law void (3:31).

**Cross-references:** 1 Tim 1:5 (identical construction); Rom 3:31 (law established, not voided); Rom 10:6-8 (law teaches faith-righteousness); Gal 3:24 (law as guide to Christ).

### Romans 10:1-3

**Context:** Paul's pastoral concern for Israel's salvation.

**Direct statement:** Israel has zeal for God but not according to knowledge. They are ignorant of God's righteousness and are going about to establish their own righteousness, having not submitted to God's righteousness.

**Key observations:**
1. The problem Paul identifies is Israel's *method* (works) and *object* (their own righteousness), not the law itself.
2. "Going about to establish [stesai] their own righteousness" uses the same root (histemi) as "we establish [histanomen] the law" in 3:31. Israel was trying to establish the wrong thing (their own righteousness) while faith properly establishes the right thing (the law).
3. "Have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God" -- the issue is submission to God's provision, not the existence of a standard.

### Romans 10:5-8

**Context:** Paul contrasts two kinds of righteousness.

**Direct statement:** Moses describes two kinds of righteousness: (1) works-righteousness from Lev 18:5 ("the man which doeth those things shall live by them"), and (2) faith-righteousness from Deut 30:12-14 ("the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart").

**Key observations:**
1. Paul identifies Deut 30:12-14 as "the righteousness which is of faith" speaking. The Torah itself articulates faith-righteousness.
2. If the law were terminated at Christ's coming, Paul's appeal to the Torah as speaking faith-righteousness would undermine his own argument. A terminated authority cannot be cited as the voice of faith-righteousness.
3. The text Paul quotes (Deut 30:12-14) is about the accessibility of God's commandment: "this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off" (Deut 30:11). Paul identifies this accessible commandment with the word of faith.
4. This confirms that the law's purpose was always to point to faith in Christ. The law and faith are not opposed; they work together toward the same goal.

### Romans 3:31

**Context:** Paul has established justification by faith (3:21-30) and now asks whether this undermines the law.

**Direct statement:** "Do we then make void [katargoumen] the law through faith? God forbid [me genoito]: yea, we establish [histanomen] the law."

**Key observations:**
1. Katargeo (G2673) means "to render idle, make void, abolish." Paul asks whether faith does this to the law.
2. Me genoito is the strongest possible negation in Greek -- "may it never be!" Paul emphatically denies faith voids the law.
3. Instead, faith establishes (histemi) the law. The present tense (histanomen) indicates ongoing action: "we are establishing the law."
4. This verse constrains the reading of Rom 10:4: if telos meant "termination," Paul would be saying faith terminates the law in 10:4 while emphatically denying faith voids the law in 3:31.
5. Same author, same epistle, same topic (faith and law).

### 1 Timothy 1:5

**Context:** Paul instructs Timothy about false teachers and the proper use of the law.

**Direct statement:** "The end [telos] of the commandment [paraggelia] is charity [agape] out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned."

**Key observations:**
1. Identical syntactic construction to Rom 10:4: telos + genitive of law/commandment = predicate nominative.
2. The meaning is unambiguously "goal/purpose": the commandment's telos is love. No interpreter reads this as "love terminates the commandment."
3. The immediate context (vv. 8-10) confirms the law is "good" and lists Decalogue violations as sins the law addresses. The commandment is not terminated; it has an ongoing purpose.
4. Same author as Rom 10:4 (Paul). Same semantic domain (law/commandment + telos). Same construction. The SIS principle dictates that the clear passage (1 Tim 1:5, where the meaning is unambiguous) interprets the unclear passage (Rom 10:4, where the meaning is disputed).

### 1 Timothy 1:8-10

**Context:** Same passage as 1 Tim 1:5.

**Direct statement:** "We know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully... the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient," followed by a list of sins that parallels the Decalogue.

**Key observations:**
1. "The law is good" (kalos ho nomos) -- present tense affirmation.
2. The sins listed (murderers, whoremongers, menstealers, liars, perjured persons) correspond to Decalogue commandments (6th, 7th, 8th, 9th).
3. If the commandment's telos in v.5 meant termination, v.8's affirmation of the law's goodness would be contradictory within the same paragraph.

### Romans 7:7-14

**Context:** Paul's personal reflection on the law and sin.

**Direct statement:** The law is not sin (7:7). The law reveals sin (7:7). The commandment was ordained to life (7:10). The law is holy, and the commandment holy, just, and good (7:12). The law is spiritual (7:14). Paul identifies the law by quoting the tenth commandment, "Thou shalt not covet" (7:7).

**Key observations:**
1. Paul's identification of the law by quoting the Decalogue confirms that nomos in Romans includes the moral law.
2. The present tense verbs ("the law IS holy... IS spiritual") indicate Paul views the law as retaining these attributes.
3. The law's limitation is located in the flesh (7:14, 8:3), not in the law itself. The law is not the problem; human sinfulness is.

### Romans 8:1-4

**Context:** The solution to the dilemma of Romans 7.

**Direct statement:** No condemnation for those in Christ (8:1). The law of the Spirit of life frees from the law of sin and death (8:2). God sent His Son to condemn sin in the flesh (8:3). **Purpose:** "That the righteousness [dikaioma] of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (8:4).

**Key observations:**
1. The stated purpose of God sending His Son is the fulfillment of the law's dikaioma in believers.
2. The law's righteous requirement is not abolished but fulfilled in Spirit-led believers.
3. This is consistent with telos = "goal": Christ is the goal of the law for righteousness, and that righteousness is actualized in believers through the Spirit.

### Romans 13:8-10

**Context:** Paul's instruction on love and the law.

**Direct statement:** Love fulfills the law. The specific content enumerated: "Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet" -- five Decalogue commandments.

**Key observations:**
1. Paul identifies the content of "the law" that love fulfills as Decalogue commandments.
2. If the law were terminated in 10:4, citing its commandments as still operative in 13:8-10 would be internally inconsistent.
3. Love is described as "the fulfilling [pleroma] of the law" (13:10), not the termination of the law. This parallels 1 Tim 1:5: the telos of the commandment is love.

### Galatians 3:19-25

**Context:** Paul's argument about the law's function in redemptive history.

**Direct statement:** The law was added because of transgressions "till the seed should come" (3:19). The law was the schoolmaster (paidagogos) "unto Christ" (3:24). After faith is come, "we are no longer under a schoolmaster" (3:25). The law is not against the promises of God (3:21).

**Key observations:**
1. "Eis Christon" (3:24) is ambiguous between directional and temporal senses.
2. The purpose clause "that we might be justified by faith" indicates the paidagogos function was oriented toward faith-justification.
3. "No longer under a schoolmaster" describes a change of supervision status, not necessarily a change of moral content.
4. Paul emphatically denies the law opposes God's promises (3:21, me genoito), just as he denies faith voids the law (Rom 3:31, me genoito).

*(Examined in depth in law-17-paul-and-law-in-galatians.)*

### 2 Corinthians 3:7-13

**Context:** Paul compares the ministries (diakoniai) of the old and new covenants.

**Direct statement:** The ministry of death, written and engraved in stones, was glorious (3:7). The glory on Moses' face was "to be done away" (katargeo, 3:7). The ministry of the Spirit is more glorious (3:8). The ministry of righteousness exceeds the ministry of condemnation in glory (3:9). Israel could not look "to the end [telos] of that which is abolished [katargoumenou]" (3:13).

**Key observations:**
1. Telos in 2 Cor 3:13 is applied to "that which is abolished" (tou katargoumenou). The referent is debated: is it the fading glory on Moses' face, or the old covenant ministry?
2. The subject of katargeo throughout this passage is the *glory* (doxa) and the *ministry* (diakonia), not the law itself. The law written on stones is described as glorious (v.7-8); what is "done away" is the ministry/glory of the old administration, not the moral content of the law.
3. Even here, telos could mean "goal/culmination" rather than "cessation endpoint": Israel could not perceive the goal/culmination toward which the fading glory pointed (i.e., Christ).

*(Examined in depth in law-19-2-corinthians-3.)*

### 1 Peter 1:9

**Context:** Peter encourages believers enduring trials.

**Direct statement:** "Receiving the end [telos] of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."

**Key observations:**
1. The telos of faith is salvation. Faith is not terminated by salvation; salvation is its outcome and goal.
2. This demonstrates the "outcome/goal" sense of telos applied to an ongoing reality (faith). The faith continues; its telos is what it produces.

### Hebrews 12:2

**Context:** The author exhorts believers to persevere in faith.

**Direct statement:** "Looking unto Jesus the author [archegos] and finisher [teleiotes] of our faith."

**Key observations:**
1. Teleiotes (G5051), from the same root as telos, means "completer, perfecter, finisher."
2. Jesus completes/perfects faith; he does not terminate it.
3. The parallel to Rom 10:4 is suggestive: Jesus is the one who brings faith to its completion (Heb 12:2), just as Christ is the telos of the law for righteousness (Rom 10:4).

### Matthew 5:17-20

**Context:** Jesus' programmatic statement about the law in the Sermon on the Mount.

**Direct statement:** "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil" (5:17). Not one jot or tittle shall pass from the law until heaven and earth pass (5:18). Breaking the least commandment and teaching others to do so brings the lowest status in the kingdom (5:19).

**Key observations:**
1. Jesus uses a double denial: "Think not... I am not come to destroy."
2. The permanence statement (v.18) ties the law's duration to heaven and earth.
3. The verb "destroy" (kataluo) consistently means demolish/annul throughout its NT uses.
4. The six antitheses that follow (5:21-48) demonstrate deepening and internalization of the law, not replacement.

*(Examined in depth in law-12-matthew-5-17-20.)*

### Deuteronomy 30:11-14

**Context:** Moses' final address to Israel about the commandment.

**Direct statement:** "This commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven... Neither is it beyond the sea... But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it."

**Key observations:**
1. Paul quotes this passage in Rom 10:6-8 and identifies it as "the righteousness which is of faith" speaking.
2. The Torah itself, through Moses' own words, teaches that the commandment is accessible and near -- in the mouth and in the heart. Paul sees this as prophetically pointing to the word of faith in Christ.
3. This demonstrates that the Torah's purpose (telos) included pointing to faith-righteousness all along.

### Genesis 15:6

**Context:** God's promise to Abraham.

**Direct statement:** "And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness."

**Key observations:**
1. Faith-righteousness precedes the giving of the law at Sinai by centuries.
2. Paul uses this in Romans 4 to establish that righteousness by faith was always God's pattern, not an innovation replacing the law.
3. The law did not create the faith-righteousness pattern; it inherited it and pointed to it.

### Romans 6:21-22

**Context:** Paul's discussion of sin and sanctification.

**Direct statement:** "The end [telos] of those things is death" (6:21). "The end [telos] everlasting life" (6:22).

**Key observations:**
1. Paul's own use of telos in Romans: the telos of sinful things is death (outcome/result). The telos of serving God is everlasting life (outcome/result).
2. Neither sin nor service to God is "terminated" by death or everlasting life, respectively. Rather, death and life are what those paths produce.
3. This same-author, same-epistle usage supports the outcome/goal sense for telos in 10:4.

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: The Law's Problem Is in the User, Not the Law
Throughout Romans, the law is consistently affirmed as holy, just, good, and spiritual (7:12, 14). The law's limitation is located in the flesh (7:14; 8:3), not in any deficiency of the law itself. Israel's failure was in their method (works instead of faith, 9:32), not in the law's nature. Paul identifies "the law of sin" and "the law of sin and death" as distinct from "the law of God" and "the law of my mind" (7:22-25; 8:2). The problem is never the moral law; it is sin operating through the flesh.

### Pattern 2: Faith Establishes Rather Than Abolishes the Law
Paul explicitly denies that faith makes the law void (3:31) and affirms that faith establishes it. The righteousness of the law is fulfilled in Spirit-walking believers (8:4). Love fulfills the Decalogue (13:8-10). The law and faith work toward the same end.

### Pattern 3: The Torah Itself Teaches Faith-Righteousness
Paul's quotation of Deut 30:12-14 in Rom 10:6-8, identifying it as "the righteousness which is of faith" speaking, demonstrates that the law was always pointing to faith. The law is not opposed to faith; it contains the message of faith. The law's telos (goal) was always Christ and the faith-righteousness he provides.

### Pattern 4: Paul's Use of Telos in Romans Is Consistently "Outcome/Goal"
Rom 6:21 (telos = death as outcome), 6:22 (telos = everlasting life as outcome), 10:4 (disputed). The two undisputed uses in Romans carry the outcome/goal sense, not the termination sense.

### Pattern 5: The 1 Timothy 1:5 Structural Parallel Resolves the Ambiguity
Same author, identical syntactic construction (telos + genitive of law/commandment = predicate nominative), same semantic domain. In 1 Tim 1:5, the meaning is unambiguously "goal/purpose." The immediate context (1 Tim 1:8-10) confirms the law remains good and operative. This is the decisive SIS parallel.

## Connections Between Passages

### The Romans Internal Argument
Romans follows a coherent progression:
- **3:20-21:** The law cannot justify, but the law witnesses to God's righteousness.
- **3:31:** Faith establishes the law.
- **7:7-14:** The law is holy, just, good, spiritual; it reveals sin; its limitation is in the flesh.
- **8:3-4:** God sent His Son so the law's righteous requirement would be fulfilled in believers.
- **9:30-10:4:** Israel failed to attain righteousness because they pursued it by works instead of by faith. Christ is the telos of the law for righteousness to believers.
- **10:5-8:** The Torah itself teaches faith-righteousness (Deut 30:12-14).
- **13:8-10:** Love fulfills the Decalogue's commands.

Each of these statements is consistent with telos = "goal/purpose." None requires telos = "termination." The "termination" reading would create internal contradictions with 3:31, 7:12, 8:4, and 13:8-10.

### The Paul-Wide Pattern
Paul's usage across his epistles:
- Rom 10:4: telos of the law = Christ (for righteousness)
- 1 Tim 1:5: telos of the commandment = love
- Gal 3:24: law as paidagogos "unto Christ" (directional/temporal)
- Gal 3:21: law is not against the promises (me genoito)
- Rom 3:31: faith does not void the law (me genoito)

Paul consistently denies that faith or Christ opposes or voids the law. He consistently affirms the law has a positive function that points to Christ and love.

### The Cross-Author Pattern
- 1 Pet 1:9: telos of faith = salvation (goal/outcome)
- Heb 12:2: Jesus is the teleiotes of faith (perfecter/completer)
- Mat 5:17-18: Jesus did not come to destroy but to fulfill; the law endures

## Word Study Insights

### Telos (G5056): The Semantic Range Favors "Goal/Purpose" for Rom 10:4

1. **Etymology:** From tello, "to set out for a definite point or goal." The etymological sense is inherently directional.
2. **Distribution:** Only 10% of NT occurrences carry the cessation sense. The outcome/goal sense is the most common.
3. **Pauline usage in Romans:** Rom 6:21-22 use telos in the outcome/result sense. Rom 13:7 uses it for tax/custom.
4. **The telos word family** (teleios, teleioo, teleiotes, teleo) consistently emphasizes completion, maturity, and reaching an objective rather than termination.
5. **The 1 Tim 1:5 parallel:** Identical construction, same author, unambiguous "goal" meaning.

### Nomos (G3551): Multiple Senses Require Context

Paul uses nomos in at least four senses in Romans (N080). In Rom 10:4, nomos is anarthrous. The immediate context (9:31-10:8) addresses Israel's pursuit of law-righteousness versus faith-righteousness. Paul's concern is with the method of attaining righteousness (works vs. faith), not with which category of law is in view.

### Katargeo (G2673): The Verb Paul Uses for "Abolish"

Paul uses katargeo when he means "make void" or "abolish." In Rom 3:31, he explicitly asks whether faith katargeo-s the law and answers with the strongest possible denial. If Paul intended to say the law was terminated in 10:4, he had katargeo available and chose not to use it. Instead, he used telos, a noun with a broader semantic range that includes "goal/purpose."

## Difficult Passages

### 2 Corinthians 3:13 — "The End of That Which Is Abolished"

This verse uses both telos and katargeo. The phrase "to telos tou katargoumenou" could be read as "the end of that which is abolished," supporting the cessation sense. However:
1. The referent of tou katargoumenou is the fading *glory* (doxa) on Moses' face, not the law itself (see v.7-8 where the subject is the glory/ministry).
2. Even if the referent is broader, telos here could mean "goal/culmination" -- Israel could not perceive the goal toward which the fading glory pointed.
3. This verse is analyzed in depth in law-19 (2 Corinthians 3).

### Galatians 3:25 — "No Longer Under a Schoolmaster"

This could be read as the law being set aside. However:
1. "Under a paidagogos" describes supervisory status, not moral content. Outgrowing a guardian does not mean outgrowing the moral standards the guardian enforced.
2. Gal 3:21 denies the law opposes God's promises.
3. This verse is analyzed in depth in law-17.

### Romans 7:4-6 — "Dead to the Law"

Paul says believers are "dead to the law by the body of Christ" and "delivered from the law." This could support telos = termination. However:
1. "Dead to" in Pauline usage means freedom from something's condemning/enslaving power, not its moral authority (cf. "dead to sin," Rom 6:11 -- sin still exists, but the believer is freed from its dominion).
2. The same passage affirms "the law is holy, just, good, spiritual" (7:12, 14) with present-tense verbs.
3. This is analyzed in depth in law-16.

## Position Evaluation

### What the Abolished Position Claims Rom 10:4 Means

The Abolished position reads telos as "termination/cessation": Christ terminated the law. The law's function ended when Christ came. The law was a temporary measure that ran its course. Rom 10:4 is one of the clearest statements that the law has been abolished.

**Evidence cited:**
- Telos can mean "termination" (10% of NT occurrences)
- Gal 3:19: "till the seed should come" (temporal language)
- Gal 3:25: "no longer under a schoolmaster"
- 2 Cor 3:7-13: "done away" language
- Rom 7:4-6: "dead to the law"

**Problems with this reading:**
1. The same author, in the same epistle, emphatically denies faith makes the law void (Rom 3:31).
2. The same author, in the same epistle, affirms the law is holy, just, good, spiritual (Rom 7:12, 14).
3. The same author, in the same epistle, states God sent His Son so the law's dikaioma would be fulfilled in believers (Rom 8:4).
4. The same author, in the same epistle, quotes Decalogue commandments as still operative (Rom 13:8-10).
5. The same author uses the identical construction (telos + genitive of commandment) in 1 Tim 1:5 with the unambiguous meaning "goal/purpose."
6. The same author quotes the Torah (Deut 30) in the immediately following verses (10:6-8) as teaching faith-righteousness, presupposing the law's ongoing authority.
7. The qualifier "for righteousness" (eis dikaiosynen) narrows the scope to the law's relationship with righteousness, not to the law's existence.

### What the Continues Position Claims Rom 10:4 Means

The Continues position reads telos as "goal/purpose": Christ is the goal the law was always pointing toward for righteousness. The law's purpose was to lead people to Christ for justification by faith. The law itself teaches faith-righteousness (Deut 30:12-14 as quoted in Rom 10:6-8).

**Evidence cited:**
- 1 Tim 1:5: identical construction, unambiguous "goal" meaning
- Rom 3:31: faith establishes, not voids, the law
- Rom 10:6-8: the Torah itself teaches faith-righteousness
- Rom 7:12, 14: the law is holy, just, good, spiritual
- Rom 8:4: the law's dikaioma fulfilled in believers
- Rom 13:8-10: Decalogue commands still operative, fulfilled in love
- Etymology of telos from tello (to set out for a goal)
- Telos word family emphasizes completion/perfection, not termination
- Paul's other uses of telos in Romans (6:21-22) carry the outcome sense
- 1 Pet 1:9: telos of faith = salvation (goal/outcome)

**Consistency check:** This reading is consistent with every passage in Romans, every passage where Paul discusses the law, and every NT use of the telos word family. It requires no E or N statement to mean something other than its lexical value.

### Which Reading Is Consistent with ALL the Evidence

The "goal/purpose" reading is consistent with all evidence gathered:
- It fits the immediate context (10:1-8): Israel missed the goal the law was pointing to.
- It fits the broader Romans context (3:31; 7:12; 8:4; 13:8-10).
- It fits the syntactic parallel (1 Tim 1:5).
- It fits the etymology and word family.
- It fits Paul's own use of telos elsewhere in Romans (6:21-22).
- It fits the cross-author evidence (1 Pet 1:9; Heb 12:2; Mat 5:17).

The "termination" reading creates conflicts with Rom 3:31, 7:12, 8:4, 13:8-10, and 1 Tim 1:5, 8-10. It requires these passages to mean something other than their plain statements, or requires the reader to assume Paul uses "law" in different senses in nearby verses without indication.
