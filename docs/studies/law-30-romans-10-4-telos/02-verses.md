## I. The Primary Passage: Romans 9:30-10:13

### Romans 9:30-33 (Israel Stumbles at the Stumbling-Stone)

> **Romans 9:30** What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.

> **Romans 9:31** But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.

> **Romans 9:32** Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;

> **Romans 9:33** As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.

### Romans 10:1-4 (Israel's Self-Righteousness and the Telos)

> **Romans 10:1** Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.

> **Romans 10:2** For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.

> **Romans 10:3** For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.

> **Romans 10:4** For Christ [is] the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.

### Romans 10:5-8 (Moses Describes Faith-Righteousness)

> **Romans 10:5** For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.

> **Romans 10:6** But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down [from above]:)

> **Romans 10:7** Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)

> **Romans 10:8** But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, [even] in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;

### Romans 10:9-13 (Salvation by Faith for All)

> **Romans 10:9** That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

> **Romans 10:10** For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

> **Romans 10:11** For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.

> **Romans 10:12** For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

> **Romans 10:13** For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

## II. The Key Parallel: 1 Timothy 1:3-11

### 1 Timothy 1:3-11 (The Telos of the Commandment Is Love)

> **1 Timothy 1:3** As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,

> **1 Timothy 1:4** Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: [so do].

> **1 Timothy 1:5** Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned:

> **1 Timothy 1:6** From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;

> **1 Timothy 1:7** Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.

> **1 Timothy 1:8** But we know that the law [is] good, if a man use it lawfully;

> **1 Timothy 1:9** Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,

> **1 Timothy 1:10** For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;

> **1 Timothy 1:11** According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

**Note:** This passage is the closest structural parallel to Rom 10:4. Both use telos (G5056) + genitive of law/commandment. In 1 Tim 1:5, "the telos of the commandment is love" -- the commandment is clearly not terminated; its GOAL/PURPOSE is love. Furthermore, vv. 8-10 explicitly affirm the law is "good" and enumerate Decalogue violations.

## III. Romans 3:19-31 (Establishing the Law Through Faith)

> **Romans 3:19** Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.

> **Romans 3:20** Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin.

> **Romans 3:21** But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;

> **Romans 3:22** Even the righteousness of God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:

> **Romans 3:23** For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

> **Romans 3:24** Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:

> **Romans 3:25** Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

> **Romans 3:26** To declare, [I say], at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

> **Romans 3:27** Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.

> **Romans 3:28** Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.

> **Romans 3:29** [Is he] the God of the Jews only? [is he] not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:

> **Romans 3:30** Seeing [it is] one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

> **Romans 3:31** Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.

## IV. Galatians 3:19-29 (The Law as Schoolmaster)

> **Galatians 3:19** Wherefore then [serveth] the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.

> **Galatians 3:20** Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one.

> **Galatians 3:21** [Is] the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.

> **Galatians 3:22** But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.

> **Galatians 3:23** But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.

> **Galatians 3:24** Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

> **Galatians 3:25** But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

> **Galatians 3:26** For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

> **Galatians 3:27** For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.

> **Galatians 3:28** There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

> **Galatians 3:29** And if ye [be] Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.

> **Romans 7:8** But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin [was] dead.

> **Romans 7:9** For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.

> **Romans 7:11** For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me].

> **Romans 7:12** Wherefore the law [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.

> **Romans 7:13** Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.

> **Romans 7:14** For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.

### Romans 8:1-4 (The Righteousness of the Law Fulfilled in Us)

> **Romans 8:1** [There is] therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

> **Romans 8:2** For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.

> **Romans 8:3** For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:

> **Romans 8:4** That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
