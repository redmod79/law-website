# Bible Study: What Does Telos Mean in Romans 10:4?

## Question
What does telos mean in Romans 10:4 ("For Christ is the end [telos] of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth")? Investigate the semantic range of telos (G5056): does it mean "termination/cessation," "goal/aim/purpose," or "fulfillment/completion"? Examine 1 Tim 1:5 ("the end [telos] of the commandment is charity" — does this mean the commandment is terminated, or that love is its goal?). Study Rom 3:31 in the same epistle ("we establish the law"). Examine Gal 3:24 ("the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ"). Analyze the immediate context of Romans 9-10: Paul is discussing Israel's pursuit of righteousness by works vs righteousness by faith. Is Paul saying the law is terminated, or that Christ is the goal/purpose the law was always pointing to — specifically for the purpose of righteousness?

## Law Series Context
This is study 30 of 31 in the Law of God series. The law-series-methodology.md at `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-series-methodology.md` must be followed for all analysis. The methodology requires investigating both the "Continues" and "Abolished" positions regarding the moral law (Ten Commandments), with evidence classification into Explicit (E), Necessary Implication (N), and Inference (I-A through I-D) tiers.

### Key Findings from Prior Study Conclusions

**From romans-10-4-telos (standalone earlier study):**
- Concluded telos means "goal/purpose" not "termination"
- Decisive evidence: 1 Tim 1:5 uses identical construction (telos + commandment) where meaning is clearly "goal" — "the end (telos) of the commandment is love"
- Paul explicitly denies faith makes the law void (Rom 3:31)
- Law was "schoolmaster unto Christ" (Gal 3:24) — pointing TO Christ
- Paul quotes Deut 30:12-14 in Rom 10:6-8 as the LAW ITSELF teaching faith-righteousness
- **NOTE:** This earlier study was not part of the law-series and lacks the law-series methodology (evidence classification, dual-position investigation). This law-30 study must apply the full methodology.

**From law-16-paul-and-law-in-romans:**
- Telos in Rom 10:4 classified as E-item E061/E405 at **Neutral** position because telos has semantic range allowing either "termination" or "goal"
- However, in the I-B resolution (I105), the weight of evidence was judged "Strong" against the Abolished reading — 11 Plain statements against abolition vs. 3 Ambiguous statements for it
- I104 classified telos = "goal/purpose" as I-A inference (evidence-extending) for Continues position, based on: 1 Tim 1:5 parallel, Rom 3:31, Rom 10:6-8
- Key finding: Paul uses nomos in at least 4 distinct senses in Romans (N080)
- Key finding: When Paul quotes specific law content in Romans, it is always Decalogue (N081)
- Key finding: The law's limitation is located in the flesh, not in the law itself (N082)
- Key finding: The stated purpose of God sending His Son is that the dikaioma of the law be fulfilled in believers (N084)
- Rom 10:6-8 (E406): Paul quotes Deut 30:12-14 and identifies it as "the righteousness which is of faith" speaking — the Torah itself teaches faith-righteousness

**From law-12-matthew-5-17-20:**
- Pleroo (G4137) in Mat 5:17 means "to fill full with intended meaning, to magnify the law" (Isa 42:21)
- Kataluo (G2647) consistently means demolish/annul; Jesus' double denial excludes abrogation
- The permanence statement (Mat 5:18) ties the law's duration to the cosmos
- Six antitheses demonstrate magnification/deepening, not replacement
- The exceeding righteousness is internal, Spirit-enabled obedience to the same law

### Study DB Findings

**From study_db.py find-passage "Rom 10:4":**
- 12 chunks across multiple studies address this verse
- law-16 analysis: "Paul is discussing Israel's failure to attain righteousness (9:30-10:3). Israel pursued righteousness by works rather than by faith."
- law-16 analysis: "Telos (G5056) has two primary senses: (1) termination/end and (2) goal/purpose/completion"
- law-08 analysis: Addressed as potential abolition evidence
- law-01 analysis: "The word telos can mean 'termination' or 'goal.' Both readings are grammatically possible."

**From study_db.py find-passage "Rom 3:31":**
- 20 chunks across studies address this verse
- law-16: "The Greek in v.31 is emphatic. Katargoumen (from katargeo, [G2673](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2673/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} — 'do we nullify?') is answered with me genoito (the strongest possible negation)"
- law-10: "Paul's emphatic me genoito ('God forbid!') in Rom 3:31 is reinforced across the NT: Faith establishes law"
- law-10: Katargeo (G2673) in Rom 3:31 vs. Eph 2:15 — same verb, opposite actions on different referents

**From study_db.py find-passage "1 Tim 1:5":**
- No chunks found — this verse has NOT been analyzed in depth in prior studies
- **This is a gap the current study must fill**

**From study_db.py find-passage "Gal 3:24":**
- 20 chunks across studies
- law-17: Paidagogos was a slave who supervised children, not a teacher. "No longer under a schoolmaster" does not mean "no longer bound by moral standards"
- law-29: The law's tutelary function analyzed
- law-15: "Paul says 'after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.' The Abolished position reads this as the moral law being terminated"

**From study_db.py find-word "telos":**
- 31 chunks mentioning telos across the studies corpus
- law-16 word study: "telos (G5056) — end / goal / purpose — From tello (to set out for a definite point or goal)"
- law-16 word study: "The 1 Timothy 1:5 Parallel — 'the telos of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart' — This is the decisive parallel: identical construction (telos + law/commandment)"
- law-01 word study: "[G5046](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5046/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}: teleios (perfect) — from telos, 'end, goal, completion'"

- Top hit (0.767): law-16 analysis — "Paul is discussing Israel's failure to attain righteousness (9:30-10:3). Israel pursued righteousness by works rather than by faith."
- Second (0.715): law-23 word study — "nomon dikaiosunes — 'a law of righteousness' (anarthrous nomos + genitive) Israel pursued this 'law of righteousness' but failed"

### Focus Areas

Based on tool discoveries, the following areas require investigation:

1. **Complete telos (G5056) word study across all 42 NT occurrences** — The prior standalone study and law-16 both identified the semantic range, but the law-series methodology requires systematic examination of all occurrences to determine which sense applies in Rom 10:4. Categorize each occurrence as "termination," "goal/purpose," "outcome/result," "custom/tax," or other.

2. **The 1 Timothy 1:5 parallel (GAP)** — Study DB shows NO prior chunks analyzing 1 Tim 1:5 in depth. This is the most important parallel (identical construction: telos + commandment/law) and must be analyzed thoroughly. If telos in 1 Tim 1:5 clearly means "goal" (the commandment's purpose is love), this is strong SIS evidence for telos = "goal" in Rom 10:4.

3. **Romans 9:30-10:13 immediate context** — Paul's argument about Israel's pursuit of righteousness: (a) Israel pursued righteousness by works (9:31-32), (b) they stumbled at the stumbling-stone (9:32-33), (c) they sought their OWN righteousness, not God's (10:3), (d) Christ is the telos of the law FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS (10:4), (e) Paul quotes Deut 30 as teaching faith-righteousness (10:6-8). What does the flow of argument tell us about the meaning of telos?

4. **Romans 3:31 — Establish the law** — katargeo (G2673) vs. histemi (G2476): Paul asks whether faith makes the law void and answers with the strongest possible negation (me genoito). How does this verse constrain the reading of Rom 10:4?

5. **Galatians 3:24 — Schoolmaster/paidagogos** — [G3807](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3807/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} appears only 3 times in NT. The law as paidagogos "unto Christ" (eis Christon). Does "unto" mean the law's purpose was to lead TO Christ (goal), or that the law served UNTIL Christ came (temporal termination)? Both readings are grammatically possible.

6. **The "for righteousness" (eis dikaiosunen) qualifier** — Rom 10:4 says Christ is the telos of the law "for righteousness." This qualifier limits the scope: telos is not about the law generally but about the law's relation to righteousness specifically. How does this affect interpretation?

7. **Romans 10:5-8 — Moses describes faith-righteousness** — Paul quotes Deut 30:12-14 as "the righteousness which is of faith" speaking. If the Torah itself teaches faith-righteousness, does this support telos = "goal" (the law was always pointing to faith)?

8. **Dual-position investigation per law-series methodology** — Present both the "termination" reading (Abolished position) and the "goal/purpose" reading (Continues position) with full evidence classification (E/N/I tiers).

- All 42 occurrences of [G5056](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5056/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (telos) in the NT for the word study

### Greek parsing needed:
- Romans 10:4 — parse every word, especially telos and the eis dikaiosunen construction
- 1 Timothy 1:5 — parse fully for comparison
- Romans 3:31 — parse katargeo and histemi forms
- Galatians 3:24 — parse the eis Christon construction
- 2 Corinthians 3:13 — parse telos usage here (to telos tou katargoumenou)
