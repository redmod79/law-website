# What Does Telos Mean in Romans 10:4?

## Question
What does telos (G5056) mean in Romans 10:4 ("For Christ is the end [telos] of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth")? Does it mean "termination/cessation," "goal/aim/purpose," or "fulfillment/completion"?

## Summary Answer
Telos in Romans 10:4 means "goal" or "purpose." Christ is the goal toward which the law was always pointing for the purpose of righteousness. This reading is established by the identical syntactic construction in 1 Timothy 1:5 (same author, telos + genitive of commandment = predicate nominative), where the meaning is unambiguously "goal/purpose" ("the telos of the commandment is love"). The "goal" reading is consistent with every statement Paul makes about the law in Romans (3:31 — faith establishes the law; 7:12 — the law is holy, just, good; 8:4 — the law's dikaioma is fulfilled in believers; 10:6-8 — the Torah itself teaches faith-righteousness; 13:8-10 — Decalogue commandments are fulfilled in love). The "termination" reading creates internal contradictions within the same epistle.

## Key Verses

**Romans 10:4** — "For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."

**1 Timothy 1:5** — "Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned."

**Romans 3:31** — "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."

**Romans 10:6-8** — "But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise... The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach." (Paul quotes Deut 30:12-14 as "the righteousness which is of faith" speaking.)

**Romans 8:4** — "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."

**Romans 13:9-10** — "Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."

## Evidence Classification

### 1. Explicit Statements Table

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Position | Tree 3 Trace |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | "Christ is the end [telos] of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth." Telos (G5056) has a semantic range including termination, goal/purpose, and outcome. | Rom 10:4 | Neutral | V1: "end of the law" is cessation vocabulary; V2 also applies. Gate 1 FAIL: "law" is anarthrous nomos — referent ambiguous. RC2: telos has semantic range allowing either reading; nomos referent unspecified. RC3: Neither V1 nor V2 survives with certainty -> Neutral |
| E2 | "The end [telos] of the commandment [paraggelia] is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned." Identical syntactic construction to Rom 10:4 (telos + genitive of law/commandment = predicate nominative). | 1 Tim 1:5 | Continues | V1: The commandment's telos is love — the commandment continues with love as its goal. Gate 1 PASS: paraggelia contextually identified as related to the law (v.7-10). Gate 2 PASS: grammar unambiguous — telos as goal/purpose. Gate 3 PASS: didactic epistle. Gate 4 PASS: consistent with E047, E028. |
| E3 | "We know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully... the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless." Paul lists Decalogue violations (murderers, whoremongers, menstealers, liars, perjured persons). | 1 Tim 1:8-10 | Continues | V1: law is good, proper use affirmed, Decalogue sins listed. Gate 1 PASS: specific Decalogue content identified. Gate 2 PASS. Gate 3 PASS. Gate 4 PASS: consistent with E010. |
| E4 | "Do we then make void [katargoumen] the law through faith? God forbid [me genoito]: yea, we establish [histanomen] the law." Paul uses the strongest Greek negation. | Rom 3:31 | Continues | V1: "establish the law" = continuation vocabulary. Gate 1 PASS: the verb histanomen applies to "the law" generally. Gate 2 PASS: me genoito is unambiguous. Gate 3 PASS. Gate 4 PASS. |
| E5 | Paul quotes Deut 30:12-14 and identifies it as "the righteousness which is of faith" speaking: "The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach." The Torah itself teaches faith-righteousness. | Rom 10:6-8 | Continues | V1: The Torah is cited as authoritative teacher of faith-righteousness — presupposes ongoing authority. Gate 1 PASS: specific Torah passage cited. Gate 2 PASS. Gate 3 PASS. Gate 4 PASS: consistent with E025, E047. |
| E6 | "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." Paul identifies the law by quoting the 10th commandment (v.7). Present-tense verbs. | Rom 7:12 | Continues | V1: law is holy/just/good = continuation vocabulary applied to Decalogue. Gate 1 PASS: 10th commandment quoted in context. Gate 2 PASS. Gate 3 PASS. Gate 4 PASS. |
| E7 | "That the righteousness [dikaioma] of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." | Rom 8:4 | Continues | V1: law's dikaioma fulfilled in believers. Gate 1 PASS. Gate 2 PASS. Gate 3 PASS. Gate 4 PASS. |
| E8 | Paul quotes five Decalogue commandments (adultery, murder, theft, false witness, covetousness) as the content love fulfills. "Love is the fulfilling [pleroma] of the law." | Rom 13:8-10 | Continues | V1: Decalogue commandments cited as still operative, fulfilled by love. Gate 1 PASS: specific moral commandments identified. Gate 2 PASS. Gate 3 PASS. Gate 4 PASS. |
| E9 | "Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law." Israel's failure was in method (works vs. faith), not in the law itself. | Rom 9:31-32 | Neutral | V1: Not continuation vocabulary. V2: Not cessation vocabulary. Both FAIL -> Neutral. The text states Israel's failure was methodological. |
| E10 | "They being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God." | Rom 10:3 | Neutral | Neither continuation nor cessation vocabulary. The text diagnoses Israel's ignorance and self-righteousness. Neutral. |
| E11 | "Receiving the end [telos] of your faith, even the salvation of your souls." Telos of faith = salvation (goal/outcome, not termination of faith). | 1 Pet 1:9 | Neutral | Neither continuation nor cessation vocabulary applied to the moral law. Demonstrates telos = goal/outcome in another author. Neutral. |
| E12 | Telos (G5056) appears 42 times in the NT. Its root tello means "to set out for a definite point or goal." The cessation sense accounts for 4 of 42 occurrences (10%). The outcome/goal sense accounts for the majority of occurrences. | Lexical data | Neutral | Grammatical/vocabulary fact both sides must accept. Neutral. |
| E13 | Paul uses telos in Rom 6:21-22 in the outcome/result sense: "the end [telos] of those things is death" (6:21); "the end [telos] everlasting life" (6:22). Neither sin nor service is "terminated" by its telos; the telos is what the path produces. | Rom 6:21-22 | Neutral | Paul's own usage of telos within the same epistle. Vocabulary data, both sides must accept. Neutral. |
| E14 | The syntactic construction telos + genitive of law/commandment = predicate nominative is identical in Rom 10:4 and 1 Tim 1:5. Same author, same construction, same semantic domain (law/commandment + telos). | Grammatical comparison | Neutral | Observable grammatical fact. Both sides must accept that the construction is identical. Neutral. |
| E15 | "The law was our schoolmaster [paidagogos] to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster." | Gal 3:24-25 | Neutral | V2: "no longer under" could be cessation vocabulary. Gate 1 FAIL: "the law" is ambiguous — could refer to the law's supervisory function rather than the law's moral content. Gate 2 FAIL: eis Christon is ambiguous (directional or temporal). RC2: the text states believers are no longer under the law's supervisory status. RC3: Neither continuation nor cessation of moral law is specified -> Neutral. |
| E16 | "Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid." Paul uses me genoito to deny the law opposes God's promises. | Gal 3:21 | Neutral | The statement denies law-promise opposition. Both sides accept this as a textual fact. Neutral. |
| E17 | "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil." Double denial of law destruction. | Mat 5:17 | Continues | V1: "not come to destroy" = continuation vocabulary. Gate 1 PASS: "the law" is the subject of non-destruction. Gate 2 PASS: kataluo is unambiguous. Gate 3 PASS. Gate 4 PASS. |
| E18 | "Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher [teleiotes, G5051] of our faith." Teleiotes, from the telos word family, means completer/perfecter, not terminator. | Heb 12:2 | Neutral | Word family data. Neutral — does not directly address the moral law. |
| E19 | "And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end [telos] of that which is abolished [katargoumenou]." | 2 Cor 3:13 | Neutral | V2: "abolished" = cessation vocabulary. Gate 1 FAIL: referent of tou katargoumenou debated — the grammatical subject throughout 2 Cor 3:7-11 is the glory/ministry, not the moral law. RC2: the text states what is done away is the glory/ministry of the old administration. RC3: cessation of a glory/ministry, not of the moral law -> Neutral (both sides agree the old covenant administration was superseded). |

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The syntactic construction telos + genitive of law/commandment appears twice in Paul's writings (Rom 10:4, 1 Tim 1:5). In the undisputed instance (1 Tim 1:5), the meaning is "goal/purpose." | E1, E2, E14 | Both sides must accept the syntactic parallel exists and that 1 Tim 1:5 means "goal/purpose." The question is whether to apply SIS here. |
| N2 | Paul denies that faith makes the law void (Rom 3:31) and cites the Torah as teaching faith-righteousness (Rom 10:6-8) within the same epistle where he writes "Christ is the telos of the law" (Rom 10:4). These three statements coexist in the same document. | E1, E4, E5 | Observable textual fact: these three statements appear in the same epistle. Any reader must account for all three. |
| N3 | Paul's other uses of telos in Romans (6:21-22) carry the outcome/result sense. The cessation sense does not appear in his Romans usage outside 10:4. | E13 | Observable usage pattern within the same epistle. Both sides can verify this. |
| N4 | In 1 Tim 1:5-10, Paul states the telos of the commandment is love (v.5) AND that the law is good (v.8) AND lists Decalogue violations as what the law addresses (vv.9-10). These are concurrent statements in the same paragraph. | E2, E3 | Observable textual fact. All three statements coexist in one paragraph. The commandment is not terminated; it has a goal (love) and ongoing content (Decalogue). |
| N5 | When Paul specifies the content of "the law" by direct quotation in Romans, the content is always Decalogue: the 10th commandment in 7:7, and the 6th-10th commandments in 13:9. | E6, E8 | Observable quotation pattern. Both sides can verify this. |

**Deduplication notes:** N2 relates to master items E025, E400, E061 (already registered). N5 overlaps with master N081.

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | Telos in Rom 10:4 means "goal/purpose," making Christ the goal toward which the law was always pointing for righteousness. | I-A | Continues | E1 (telos has semantic range), E2 (1 Tim 1:5 identical construction = goal), E5 (Torah teaches faith-righteousness), E4 (faith establishes law), E14 (identical construction), N1 (undisputed parallel), N2 (three coexisting statements). The claim systematizes these E/N items into the conclusion that "goal" is the correct reading. | Criterion #5 (systematizes E/N items) and #4a (SIS with verified connection: same author, identical construction). |
| I2 | Telos in Rom 10:4 means "termination/cessation," meaning Christ terminated/abolished the moral law. | I-B | Abolished | E1 (telos can mean termination), E15 (no longer under paidagogos), E19 (2 Cor 3:13 telos + katargeo). But AGAINST: E2 (1 Tim 1:5 = goal), E3 (law is good, 1 Tim 1:8-10), E4 (faith establishes law, Rom 3:31), E5 (Torah teaches faith-righteousness, Rom 10:6-8), E6 (law is holy/just/good, Rom 7:12), E7 (dikaioma fulfilled, Rom 8:4), E8 (Decalogue operative, Rom 13:8-10), E17 (Jesus did not destroy the law, Mat 5:17), N1 (1 Tim 1:5 parallel), N2 (coexisting statements), N4 (1 Tim 1:5-10 concurrent statements). The claim requires telos to mean "termination" despite the identical construction in 1 Tim 1:5 meaning "goal" and despite multiple explicit statements in the same epistle affirming the law's ongoing validity. | Criterion #2 (choosing "termination" from semantic range over "goal"); criterion #1 (adding the concept that "the law" in 10:4 is the entire moral law being terminated, despite the qualifier "for righteousness"). |
| I3 | Paul's argument in Romans 9:30-10:8 demonstrates that the law's purpose was always to point to Christ for faith-righteousness, and Israel's failure was methodological (works instead of faith), not due to a deficiency in the law. | I-A | Continues | E9 (Israel failed due to method), E10 (Israel ignorant and self-righteous), E5 (Torah teaches faith-righteousness), E1 (telos for righteousness), E7 (dikaioma fulfilled in believers). Systematizes the flow of the passage. | Criterion #5 (systematizes multiple E items from the same passage into a coherent reading). |
| I4 | The qualifier "for righteousness" (eis dikaiosynen) in Rom 10:4 limits the scope to the law's relationship with righteousness specifically. It does not address whether the law's moral content persists. | I-A | Neutral | E1 (the text includes "for righteousness"). The qualifier is in the text, but the inference about its limiting function requires recognizing eis + accusative as a purpose clause, which is standard Greek grammar but involves parsing beyond bare quotation. | Criterion #5 (derives scope limitation from textual observation). |

### I-B Resolution: I2 — Telos in Rom 10:4 Means "Termination" (Abolished Claim)

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR termination: E1 (telos can mean termination — semantic range), E15 (Gal 3:24-25, no longer under paidagogos — Neutral), E19 (2 Cor 3:13, telos + katargoumenou — Neutral)
- AGAINST termination: E2 (1 Tim 1:5 identical construction = goal), E3 (1 Tim 1:8-10, law is good), E4 (Rom 3:31, faith establishes law), E5 (Rom 10:6-8, Torah teaches faith-righteousness), E6 (Rom 7:12, law is holy/just/good), E7 (Rom 8:4, dikaioma fulfilled in believers), E8 (Rom 13:8-10, Decalogue operative), E17 (Mat 5:17, not come to destroy), N1 (undisputed 1 Tim 1:5 parallel), N2 (three coexisting statements in Romans), N4 (1 Tim 1:5-10 concurrent affirmation)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Side | Level | Rationale |
|------|------|-------|-----------|
| E1 | FOR | Ambiguous | Telos has a semantic range including both termination and goal; the verse does not self-determine which sense applies |
| E15 | FOR | Ambiguous | "No longer under a schoolmaster" does not specify whether moral content or supervisory status is ended; eis Christon is grammatically ambiguous |
| E19 | FOR | Ambiguous | Referent of tou katargoumenou is debated (glory vs. law); telos here could also mean goal/culmination |
| E2 | AGAINST | Plain | Identical construction in same author; meaning unambiguously "goal/purpose"; immediate context (vv.8-10) confirms law's ongoing validity |
| E3 | AGAINST | Plain | Same paragraph as E2; directly states law is good and lists Decalogue violations |
| E4 | AGAINST | Plain | Direct question and answer: faith makes the law void? God forbid; we establish the law. Same epistle as Rom 10:4 |
| E5 | AGAINST | Contextually Clear | Paul quotes Torah as teaching faith-righteousness in the verses immediately following Rom 10:4 |
| E6 | AGAINST | Plain | Law is holy, just, good — present tense, same epistle, Decalogue identified by quotation |
| E7 | AGAINST | Contextually Clear | Purpose of God sending His Son = law's dikaioma fulfilled in believers |
| E8 | AGAINST | Plain | Five Decalogue commandments quoted as operative; love is the fulfilling of the law |
| E17 | AGAINST | Plain | Jesus' double denial of law-destruction; different author but same topic |
| N1 | AGAINST | Plain | The syntactic parallel exists and 1 Tim 1:5 is undisputed as "goal" |
| N2 | AGAINST | Plain | Observable textual coexistence of three statements in the same epistle |
| N4 | AGAINST | Plain | Observable concurrent statements in one paragraph |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
- FOR termination: 3 items, all Ambiguous. No Plain or Contextually Clear item supports the termination reading. The FOR items establish only that the termination reading is *grammatically possible*, not that the text requires it.
- AGAINST termination: 8 E-items (6 Plain, 2 Contextually Clear) + 3 N-items (all Plain). These include the decisive same-author syntactic parallel (1 Tim 1:5), same-epistle affirmations (Rom 3:31, 7:12, 8:4, 13:8-10), and cross-author confirmation (Mat 5:17).

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
The clear passage (1 Tim 1:5) interprets the unclear passage (Rom 10:4). The SIS connection is maximally strong: same author, identical syntactic construction, same semantic domain. In 1 Tim 1:5, telos + genitive of commandment = love (goal/purpose). This determines the reading of the identical construction in Rom 10:4: telos + genitive of law = Christ (goal/purpose). The multiple Plain statements in the same epistle (Rom 3:31, 7:12, 8:4, 13:8-10) reinforce that the law is not terminated.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Strong**
Plain statements on the AGAINST side (11 items across E and N tiers) with only Ambiguous statements on the FOR side (3 items). The 1 Tim 1:5 parallel is decisive: identical construction, same author, unambiguous meaning. The termination reading requires all three FOR items to be read in their minority/contested sense while ignoring or reinterpreting 11 Plain/Contextually Clear statements. The resolution is Strong against the termination reading.

## Word Study Summary

### Telos (G5056) Semantic Range

| Sense | Count (of 42) | Percentage |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Eschatological end | 8 | 19% |
| Outcome/result | 8 | 19% |
| Perseverance ("unto the end") | 9 | 21% |
| Cessation/ending | 4 | 10% |
| Cosmic Alpha-Omega | 3 | 7% |
| Tax/custom | 3 | 7% |
| Goal/purpose | 1-2 | 2-5% |
| Spatial extent | 3 | 7% |
| Ambiguous | 1 | 2% |

The cessation sense (10%) is a minority usage. Paul's own uses of telos in Romans outside 10:4 (Rom 6:21-22) carry the outcome/result sense. The root tello means "to set out for a definite point or goal." The telos word family (teleios, teleioo, teleiotes) consistently emphasizes completion and perfection, not termination.

### The 1 Timothy 1:5 Decisive Parallel

The construction telos + genitive of commandment/law = predicate is identical in Rom 10:4 and 1 Tim 1:5. In 1 Tim 1:5, the meaning is unambiguously "goal/purpose" (the commandment's telos is love). The immediate context (1 Tim 1:8-10) confirms the law is good and lists Decalogue violations. Same author, same construction, same semantic domain. SIS dictates: the clear passage determines the reading of the disputed one.

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies)

1. Telos (G5056) has a semantic range that includes both "termination" and "goal/purpose" — the word itself does not determine the reading in isolation.
2. The identical syntactic construction (telos + genitive of law/commandment = predicate) in 1 Tim 1:5 has the unambiguous meaning "goal/purpose."
3. Paul denies that faith makes the law void and affirms faith establishes the law (Rom 3:31).
4. Paul identifies the Torah as teaching faith-righteousness (Rom 10:6-8, quoting Deut 30:12-14).
5. Paul affirms the law is holy, just, good, and spiritual (Rom 7:12, 14), identifying it by quoting the Decalogue (Rom 7:7).
6. Paul states the purpose of God sending His Son was that the law's dikaioma might be fulfilled in believers (Rom 8:4).
7. Paul quotes five Decalogue commandments as operative content fulfilled by love (Rom 13:8-10).
8. Israel's failure was methodological (pursuing righteousness by works rather than by faith), not due to a deficiency in the law (Rom 9:31-32; 10:3).
9. In 1 Tim 1:5-10, the telos of the commandment is love AND the law is good AND Decalogue violations are listed — all in the same paragraph by the same author.
10. Jesus stated he did not come to destroy the law but to fulfill it (Mat 5:17).

## What CANNOT Be Said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture)

1. No verse in the NT says "the moral law has been terminated" or "the Ten Commandments are abolished."
2. No verse says "telos in Romans 10:4 means termination" — this is an inference from one possible reading of telos.
3. No verse says "telos in Romans 10:4 means goal" — this is an inference from the 1 Tim 1:5 parallel and the broader context. (However, this inference has the 1 Tim 1:5 SIS connection that the termination reading lacks.)
4. Neither side can claim the verse is unambiguous in isolation. The ambiguity of telos requires contextual resolution.
5. The qualifier "for righteousness" (eis dikaiosynen) limits the scope, but no verse explicitly states what this limitation entails for the broader question of law continuity.

## Conclusion

The evidence for law-30 (Romans 10:4 — Telos) classifies as follows:

Eight Explicit statements use law-continuation vocabulary (the law is holy/just/good, faith establishes the law, the Torah teaches faith-righteousness, the law's dikaioma is fulfilled in believers, Decalogue commandments are operative, Jesus did not come to destroy the law, the telos of the commandment is love, and the law is good with Decalogue content identified). Zero Explicit statements use law-cessation vocabulary applied to the moral law — the only cessation-vocabulary items (Gal 3:24-25, 2 Cor 3:13) fail the referent gate because their subjects are the law's supervisory function and the fading glory/ministry, respectively, not the moral law itself.

The single Abolished-direction item (I2) is classified I-B (competing evidence) and resolved Strong against, with 11 Plain/Contextually Clear items opposing the termination reading versus 3 Ambiguous items supporting it.

The decisive evidence is the 1 Timothy 1:5 parallel: same author, identical syntactic construction, unambiguous "goal/purpose" meaning, with the immediate context (1 Tim 1:8-10) affirming the law's goodness and Decalogue content. The SIS principle requires the clear passage to govern the reading of the disputed one.
