| Verse | Text | Sense |
|-------|------|-------|
| 2Co 3:13 | "could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished" | Ambiguous: goal/outcome OR fading endpoint |

**Note on 2Co 3:13:** This verse is important because it uses both telos AND katargeo (the same verb from Rom 3:31). The phrase "eis to telos tou katargoumenou" could mean either "unto the goal/culmination of that which was being set aside" or "unto the fading end of that which was being abolished." The referent of "that which is abolished" is debated: is it the glory (doxa) on Moses' face, or the old covenant ministry?

### Summary of Semantic Range

| Sense | Count | % of all occurrences |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| Temporal end / eschatological | 8 | 19% |
| Outcome / result / consequence | 8 | 19% |
| Perseverance ("unto the end") | 9 | 21% |

### The 1 Timothy 1:5 Parallel (CRITICAL)

**Greek structure comparison:**

| Element | Romans 10:4 | 1 Timothy 1:5 |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Subject | telos (G5056, Nom Sg N) | to telos (G5056, Nom Sg N, with article) |
| Genitive modifier | nomou (G3551, Gen Sg M) | tes paraggelias (G3852, Gen Sg F) |
| Predicate | Christos (G5547, Nom Sg M) | agape (G26, Nom Sg F) |
| Additional | eis dikaiosynen panti to pisteuonti | ek katharas kardias... |

**Structural parallel:**
- Rom 10:4: telos + [genitive of law/commandment] = [predicate nominative]
- 1Ti 1:5: telos + [genitive of law/commandment] = [predicate nominative]

**In 1 Tim 1:5:**
- "The telos of the commandment (paraggelia) is love (agape)"
- The commandment is NOT terminated -- love is its GOAL/PURPOSE
- The immediate context confirms: vv. 8-10 say the law is GOOD and list Decalogue violations as still sinful
- This is decisive evidence for the "goal/purpose" sense in the identical construction

**paraggelia (G3852):** Means "charge, command, mandate" (5 NT occurrences: Acts 5:28; 16:24; 1Th 4:2; 1Ti 1:5). In 1 Tim 1:5, it refers to the charge/commandment Paul is discussing -- specifically related to the law (see v. 7-10).

### The Etymology Argument

The root tello means "to set out for a definite point or goal." This etymology supports the "goal/purpose" sense, though etymology alone does not determine meaning in context. However, it indicates the word's semantic core involves directionality toward an objective.

## [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - nomos (law)

**Original:** nomos
**Transliteration:** nomos
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 197 NT occurrences
**Definition:** From nemo (to parcel out); law, statute

### Key for This Study
- In Rom 10:4: nomou (genitive) -- anarthrous (no article)
- Paul uses nomos in at least 4 distinct senses in Romans:
  1. The Mosaic law as a whole (the Torah)
  2. The moral law / Ten Commandments specifically
  3. A principle or system (e.g., "law of faith" Rom 3:27; "law of sin" Rom 7:23)
  4. The OT Scriptures generally (e.g., Rom 3:19)
- When Paul quotes specific law content, it is consistently Decalogue (Rom 7:7 = 10th commandment; Rom 13:9 = commandments 6-10)

### Translation Distribution
```
95 (56.2%) law
49 (29.0%) the law
14 ( 8.3%) of the law
```

## [G1343](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1343/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - dikaiosune (righteousness)

**Original:** dikaiosune
**Transliteration:** dikaiosyne
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 92 NT occurrences
**Definition:** Equity (of character or act); Christian justification

### Key for This Study
- In Rom 10:4: eis dikaiosynen = "for/unto righteousness" (purpose)
- This qualifier limits the scope: Christ is the telos of the law specifically FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS
- The question is not whether the law exists, but where righteousness comes from
- Paul's argument: righteousness comes through faith in Christ, not through works of the law
- Key occurrences in context:
  - Rom 10:3 (3x): "God's righteousness... their own righteousness... the righteousness of God"
  - Rom 10:4: "for righteousness"
  - Rom 10:5: "the righteousness which is of the law"
  - Rom 10:6: "the righteousness which is of faith"
  - Rom 10:10: "believeth unto righteousness"

## [G2673](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2673/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - katargeo (make void, abolish)

**Original:** katargeo
**Transliteration:** katargeo
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**BLB Count:** 27 NT occurrences
**Definition:** To be (render) entirely idle (useless); to make void, abolish

### Key for This Study
- Used in Rom 3:31: "Do we then make void (katargoumen) the law through faith? God forbid (me genoito)!"
- Same verb used in 2Co 3:7,11,13 for "done away" / "abolished"
- Same verb used in Eph 2:15 for "having abolished"
- Same verb used in Gal 5:4 for "become of no effect"
- The verb's wide translation range shows it does NOT always mean "abolish/terminate" -- it can mean "render inactive" or "make powerless"

### Critical Usage in Rom 3:31
Paul explicitly asks: "Do we katargeo the law through faith?" and answers with me genoito (the strongest possible Greek negation). This constrains the reading of Rom 10:4: if telos meant "termination" of the law, it would directly contradict Paul's emphatic denial in 3:31 that faith makes the law void.

### Translation Variants
```
shall destroy (2x), is done away (2x), make void (1x), made of none effect (1x),
might be destroyed (1x), bring to nought (1x), shall be done away (1x),
of that which is abolished (1x), Having abolished (1x), he might destroy (1x)
```

## [G2476](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2476/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - histemi (stand, establish)

**Original:** histemi
**Transliteration:** histemi
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**BLB Count:** 158 NT occurrences
**Definition:** To stand, set, establish

### Key for This Study
- Used in Rom 3:31: "we establish (histanomen) the law"
- Present Active Indicative 1st Plural: "we are establishing the law"
- This is the POSITIVE counterpart to the negated katargeo
- Paul says faith does not destroy the law; rather, faith ESTABLISHES it
- Also used in Rom 10:3: Israel was "going about to establish (stesai) their own righteousness"
  - Same root, different form: they sought to establish their OWN righteousness
  - Paul says faith establishes the LAW (3:31) while Israel wrongly tried to establish their OWN righteousness (10:3)

---

## [G4137](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4137/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - pleroo (fulfill, fill)

**Original:** pleroo
**Transliteration:** pleroo
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**BLB Count:** 90 NT occurrences
**Definition:** To make replete; to fulfill, fill full

### Key for This Study
- Used in Rom 8:4: "That the righteousness (dikaioma) of the law might be fulfilled (plerothe) in us"
- Used in Rom 13:8: "he that loveth another hath fulfilled (pepleroken) the law"
- Used in Mat 5:17: "I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil (plerosai)"
- Used in Gal 5:14: "all the law is fulfilled (peplerotal) in one word"
- NOTE: telos and pleroo are DIFFERENT words. Paul does not use pleroo in Rom 10:4; he uses telos. If he meant "fulfillment" in the sense of pleroo, he had that word available.

### Translation Variants
```
it might be fulfilled (8x), be fulfilled (6x), filled (4x),
was fulfilled (3x), to fulfil (3x), is fulfilled (3x), fulfilled (3x)
```

## [G3807](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3807/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - paidagogos (schoolmaster, tutor)

**Original:** paidagogos
**Transliteration:** paidagogos
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 3 NT occurrences only
**Definition:** From pais (child) + ago (to lead); a boy-leader, servant-guardian

### All 3 Occurrences
1. **Gal 3:24** - "the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ"
2. **Gal 3:25** - "we are no longer under a schoolmaster"
3. **1Co 4:15** - "though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ"

### Key for This Study
- The paidagogos was NOT a teacher but a slave who supervised children, escorted them to school, and enforced discipline
- The child did not "outgrow" the MORAL STANDARDS the paidagogos enforced; they outgrew the SUPERVISORY STATUS of being under a guardian
- "No longer under a paidagogos" = change of STATUS (mature heir vs. supervised minor), not change of MORAL STANDARD
- The eis Christon in Gal 3:24 is ambiguous:
  - Directional: "unto/toward Christ" (the law led us TO Christ = goal)
  - Temporal: "until Christ" (the law served UNTIL Christ came = termination point)

### Greek Parsing of Gal 3:24
```
hoste ho nomos paidagogos hemon gegonen eis Christon, hina ek pisteos dikaiothomen

- gegonen (Perfect Active Indicative): "has become" - completed action with ongoing result
- eis Christon: prep + accusative - directional or temporal
- hina ek pisteos dikaiothomen: "so that we might be justified by faith" - purpose clause
```

## Telos Word Family Summary

| Strong's | Word | Part of Speech | Count | Definition |
|----------|------|---------------|-------|------------|
| [G5056](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5056/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | telos | noun | 42 | End, goal, purpose, completion |
| [G5055](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5055/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | teleo | verb | 26 | To end, complete, execute, discharge |
| [G5048](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5048/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | teleioo | verb | 24 | To complete, accomplish, perfect |
| [G5046](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5046/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | teleios | adjective | 19 | Complete, perfect, mature |
| [G5051](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5051/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | teleiotes | noun | 1 | Completer, finisher (Heb 12:2 only) |
| [G5049](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5049/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | teleios (adv) | adverb | 1 | Completely |
| [G5050](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5050/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} | teleiosis | noun | 2 | Completion, verification |

The word family consistently carries the sense of COMPLETION, MATURITY, and REACHING A GOAL rather than mere cessation or termination. Jesus is called the teleiotes (G5051) of faith in Heb 12:2 -- the "finisher/completer/perfecter" of faith -- not the terminator of faith.

## [G4102](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4102/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - pistis (faith)

**Original:** pistis
**Transliteration:** pistis
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 244 NT occurrences
**Definition:** Persuasion, credence; moral conviction of religious truth

### Key for This Study
- In Rom 10:4: panti to pisteuonti = "to everyone who believes" (present active participle of pisteuo, from pistis)
- The telos of the law for righteousness is specifically "to every one that believeth"
- This connects to Rom 1:16: "the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth"
- And to Rom 3:22: "unto all and upon all them that believe"
- The "to every one that believeth" qualifier in Rom 10:4 further supports telos = goal: Christ is the law's goal FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS to all who believe

---

## [G3852](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3852/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} - paraggelia (commandment/charge)

**Original:** paraggelia
**Transliteration:** paraggelia
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 5 NT occurrences
**Definition:** A mandate; charge, command

### Key for This Study
- Used in 1 Tim 1:5: "the telos of the paraggelia is love"
- This is the genitive noun modified by telos, parallel to nomou in Rom 10:4
- Both nomos and paraggelia refer to commandment/law in their respective contexts
- The fact that the paraggelia in 1 Tim 1:5 is NOT terminated (love is its goal, and vv. 8-10 affirm the law's ongoing validity) is the strongest internal-biblical evidence for telos = "goal" in Rom 10:4

---

## Key Greek Parsing Comparison: Rom 10:4 vs 1 Tim 1:5

### Romans 10:4
```
telos        gar    nomou     Christos  eis dikaiosynen  panti to pisteuonti
[end/goal]   for    of-law    Christ    for-righteousness to-every the believing
Nom.Sg.N     CONJ   Gen.Sg.M  Nom.Sg.M  PREP+Acc.Sg.F   Dat.Sg.M  Dat.Sg.M
```

### 1 Timothy 1:5
```
to  de   telos       tes paraggelias     estin   agape
the but  [end/goal]  of-the commandment  is      love
Art CONJ Nom.Sg.N    Gen.Sg.F            V-3S    Nom.Sg.F
```

**Structural identity:** Both sentences predicate telos + genitive of a law/commandment term with a nominative predicate. In 1 Tim 1:5, the meaning is unambiguously "goal/purpose" (love is the goal of the commandment). This makes the identical construction in Rom 10:4 most naturally read as "Christ is the goal/purpose of the law."
