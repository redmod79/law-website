# Civil/Judicial Laws in the Pentateuch and Their Relationship to Moral and Ceremonial Categories

## Question
What are the civil/judicial laws in the Pentateuch and how do they relate to the moral and ceremonial categories? Investigate the "judgments" (mishpatim) of Exodus 21-23 -- case law, property law, penalties, social regulations. Are civil laws applications of moral principles? Are they distinct from moral and ceremonial law? What happens to civil law when Israel ceases to be a theocratic nation? Does the Reformed threefold division find support in the Bible itself?

## Summary Answer
The mishpatim (H4941, "judgments") of Exodus 21-23 function as case-law applications of Decalogue moral principles to specific social situations within the theocratic state. The Bible uses three functionally distinct terms for types of law -- mitsvot (commandments), chuqqim (statutes), and mishpatim (judgments) -- and Deuteronomy 4:13-14 explicitly distinguishes "his covenant, even ten commandments" from the "statutes and judgments" taught through Moses. The civil laws overlap with the ceremonial system at specific points (Lev 6:1-7 requires both civil restitution and a trespass offering for the same offense), meaning the civil and ceremonial categories are not always separable in practice. The NT transfers the judicial function from the theocratic state to secular government (Rom 13:1-7) and the church community (1 Cor 6:1-8), affirming the moral principles behind civil law while not prescribing the specific Mosaic forms.

## Key Verses

**Exodus 21:1** -- "Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them." (Introduces the mishpatim as a distinct body of legislation mediated through Moses.)

**Deuteronomy 4:13-14** -- "And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments." (Moses' most explicit distinction between the Decalogue and the mishpatim/chuqqim.)

**Deuteronomy 5:31** -- "I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them." (The three-term formula: mitsvot + chuqqim + mishpatim.)

**Leviticus 6:4-6** -- "He shall restore that which he took violently away...and shall add the fifth part more thereto...And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without blemish." (Civil restitution and ceremonial offering required for the same offense.)

**Genesis 9:5-6** -- "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man." (Pre-Mosaic civil judicial principle grounded in the image of God.)

**Romans 13:4** -- "He is the minister of God to thee for good...he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil." (NT transfer of judicial function to civil government.)

**1 Corinthians 6:2, 5** -- "Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?...Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you...that shall be able to judge between his brethren?" (NT transfer of intra-community judicial function to the church.)

**Matthew 5:38-39** -- "Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye...But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil." (Jesus addresses the lex talionis in the context of personal conduct.)

**Matthew 23:23** -- "Judgment, mercy, and faith: these are the weightier matters of the law." (Jesus classifies judgment/justice as a "weightier matter.")

Tree 3: V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Both sides must acknowledge the overlap.) |
| N4 | The civil judicial principle predates the Mosaic system: Genesis 9:5-6 establishes capital punishment for murder, delegated to human agency, grounded in the image of God, before any formal law code.

(The principle is applied; whether this means the civil law "continues" or merely that a useful principle is reused is an interpretive question.) |
| N6 | The NT transfers the judicial function from the Israelite theocracy to two institutions: secular government (Rom 13:1-7 -- the ruler as "minister of God" punishing evil) and the church community (1 Cor 6:1-8 -- believers judging disputes among themselves). | E41, E42 | Neutral | Gate 0: N-Test 1: Both sides acknowledge Paul teaches government authority and intra-church dispute resolution.

Each I-item below has been processed through **Tree 2 (I-Type Classification)** and **Tree 5 (I-Positional Classification)**.

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria | Position | Tree 2/5 Trace |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|----------|----------------|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that the civil/judicial laws (mishpatim) are applications of the Decalogue's moral principles, such that the moral principle endures even when the specific civil application changes form. | I-A | The mishpatim apply Decalogue principles to specific situations (N1). The NT transfers the judicial function to government and church (N6, E41, E42). Jesus identifies judgment/justice as a "weightier matter" (E45, Mat 23:23). The pre-Mosaic basis for civil justice exists independently of the Mosaic system (N4, E16). | No single verse says "the moral principle behind civil law endures while the specific form changes." This systematizes N1, N4, N6, and E45 into a doctrinal claim. | #5 (systematizing multiple E/N items) | Continues | Tree 2: Source test -- all components from E/N tables. Direction test -- no E/N requires a different meaning. -> I-A. Tree 5: IP1 -- supports the claim that moral law principles remain binding. -> CONTINUES. |
| I2 | The Bible teaches that the threefold division (moral, ceremonial, civil) is a compatible external framework for the civil category, as it is for the moral and ceremonial categories (per law-01, I8). | I-C | The Bible uses three functionally distinct terms for law types (N2, E3). Deu 4:13-14 distinguishes the Decalogue from statutes and judgments (E2). Law-04 distinguished ceremonial from moral. But the Bible does not use the label "civil" or "judicial" as a formal category name. | The label "civil" as a distinct category is not found in the text. The text shows functional distinctions (mishpat vs. choq vs. mitsvah) that are COMPATIBLE with a threefold framework, but the framework itself is imposed from outside. | #3 (applying an external framework) | Neutral | Tree 2: Source test -- "threefold division" as a labeled taxonomy is NOT in the E/N tables. -> External. Direction test -- does not override any E/N. -> I-C. Tree 5: IP3 -- Both sides can use or reject this framework. -> NEUTRAL. -> Cross-ref Master I008 (already registered). |
| I3 | The Bible teaches that the specific civil/judicial forms of the mishpatim (restitution formulas, cities of refuge, 40-stripe limit, theocratic court system) were tied to the theocratic state and ceased when that state ceased. | I-B | The civil laws were given within the theocratic framework (E18, Exo 19:5-6). Israel rejected the theocracy (E19, 1Sa 8:7). The NT transfers the judicial function to government and church (N6, E41, E42) without prescribing specific Mosaic forms. The cessation vocabulary (dogma, E47) lexically encompasses civil decrees. BUT: No verse explicitly says the mishpatim are abolished. The "throughout your generations" formula (E31) is applied to some civil provisions. Jesus cites the Mosaic civil-moral combination (E43). The NT applies the two-witness rule (N5). | No verse says "the civil forms ceased with the theocracy." The claim combines: (a) the theocratic context of the mishpatim, (b) the rejection of the theocracy, (c) the NT transfer of judicial function, and (d) the absence of NT prescription of specific Mosaic civil forms. But E31 says "throughout your generations," and the NT applies some civil principles (N5). | #2 (choosing between possible readings), #5 (systematizing) | Neutral | Tree 2: Source test -- all components from E/N tables. Direction test -- E31 ("throughout your generations") must be read as less than perpetual for this claim to hold; N5 (NT applies the two-witness rule) must be read as principle-adoption rather than civil-law-continuation. -> I-B. Tree 5: IP0 -- this inference concerns ONLY the cessation of civil/judicial laws in their specific theocratic form. Both positions agree these ceased. -> NEUTRAL. (Reclassified: ceremonial/civil cessation is common ground, not the Abolished position) |
| I4 | The Bible teaches that the civil and ceremonial categories cannot be cleanly separated because Leviticus 6:1-7 requires both civil restitution and a ceremonial offering for the same offense, and therefore any cessation of the ceremonial system also abolishes the intertwined civil provisions. | I-B | Lev 6:1-7 requires BOTH restitution AND a trespass offering (N3, E26). The ceremonial system has been fulfilled (law-04). But: Numbers 5:7-8 distinguishes the civil restitution ("beside the ram"), and the moral principle of restitution appears in the NT (E54, Phm 1:19; Luk 19:8 -- Zacchaeus). | The claim that ceremonial cessation necessarily entails civil cessation requires an additional inference: that inseparability in one passage means inseparability in principle. But Num 5:7-8 explicitly separates the two components ("beside the ram"), and the NT shows restitution principles persisting. | #2 (choosing between readings), #5 (systematizing) | Neutral | Tree 2: Source test -- components from E/N. Direction test -- E27 ("beside the ram" separating civil from ceremonial) and E54 (NT restitution) must be reinterpreted. -> I-B. Tree 5: IP0 -- this inference concerns the cessation of civil/ceremonial provisions in their specific theocratic form. Both positions agree these ceased. -> NEUTRAL. (Reclassified: ceremonial/civil cessation is common ground, not the Abolished position) |
| I5 | The Bible teaches that the moral principles underlying the civil laws (justice, proportionality, human dignity, individual responsibility, protection of the vulnerable) are eternal because they reflect God's character and are affirmed in the NT. | I-A | Jesus classifies judgment/justice as a "weightier matter of the law" (E45). Paul grounds civil authority in God's delegated authority (E41). The pre-Mosaic basis for civil justice is the image of God (E16). Individual responsibility is affirmed by Ezekiel (Eze 18) and is universal. The two-witness principle is applied in the NT (N5). Protection of the vulnerable is reaffirmed (Jas 1:27). | No single verse says "the moral principles behind civil law are eternal." This systematizes multiple E/N items showing the enduring nature of justice principles. | #5 (systematizing) | Continues | Tree 2: Source -> text-derived. Direction -> no E/N reinterpreted. -> I-A. Tree 5: IP1 -> CONTINUES. |
| I6 | The Bible teaches that the "handwriting of ordinances" (Col 2:14, dogmata) nailed to the cross includes the civil/judicial decrees along with the ceremonial ones, since dogma lexically encompasses civil law. | I-B | The lexicon defines dogma as "a law (civil, ceremonial or ecclesiastical)" (E47). Col 2:14 and Eph 2:15 use dogma for what was abolished. BUT: The context of Col 2:16-17 specifies "meat, drink, holyday, new moon, sabbath days" -- all ceremonial references. No civil referent is named. The Decalogue was never described with dogma vocabulary (law-04, N018). | The claim that dogma in Col 2:14 includes civil law requires extending the lexical range beyond what the context specifies. The context points to ceremonial regulations (v.16-17). The Abolished reading requires choosing the broader lexical meaning; the Continues reading requires restricting it to the contextual referents. | #2 (choosing between readings) | Neutral | Tree 2: Source -> text-derived (from E47 and the Col 2:14 text). Direction -> restricting dogma to ceremonial requires E47 to have a narrower meaning than its full lexical range. -> I-B. Tree 5: IP0 -- this inference concerns whether civil decrees (along with ceremonial ones) were nailed to the cross. Both positions agree civil and ceremonial laws ceased. -> NEUTRAL. (Reclassified: ceremonial/civil cessation is common ground, not the Abolished position) |
| I7 | The Bible teaches that Jesus abolished the lex talionis (eye for eye) in Matthew 5:38-42, replacing the civil penalty with a higher ethic of non-resistance. | I-B | Jesus said "Ye have heard...An eye for an eye...But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil" (E44). BUT: Jesus also said "Think not that I am come to destroy the law" (Mat 5:17, E021 in master). The context addresses personal responses ("whosoever shall smite thee," "if any man will sue thee") rather than the judicial system. | The Abolished reading of Mat 5:38-42 conflicts with Mat 5:17 (Jesus did not come to destroy the law). The Continues reading distinguishes personal ethics from judicial administration. Both readings require interpretive choices about the scope of Jesus' teaching. | #2 (choosing between readings) | Neutral | Tree 2: Source -> text-derived. Direction -> E021 (not come to destroy) must be qualified for this reading. -> I-B. Tree 5: IP0 -- the lex talionis (eye for eye, Exo 21:23-25) is a civil/judicial penalty, not the moral law (Decalogue). Both positions agree civil judicial forms in their specific theocratic expression are not binding. -> NEUTRAL. (Reclassified: ceremonial/civil cessation is common ground, not the Abolished position) |
| I8 | The Bible teaches that the entire law system (moral, ceremonial, and civil) was abolished at the cross, and the threefold division is a human invention that the Bible does not support. | I-D | Col 2:14 says "ordinances" nailed to the cross (E47). Eph 2:15 says "the law of commandments contained in ordinances" abolished (E47). BUT: This requires overriding 1 Cor 7:19 which distinguishes commandments from circumcision (E143 in master), Rom 7:12 which calls the law holy/just/good (E010), Mat 5:17-18 which says the law will not pass away (E021), and the multiple E-items establishing the Decalogue's unique markers (E001-E009). | The claim requires ALL law to have been abolished, but multiple E-items affirm the moral law's continuing authority. The claim overrides these with a reading that "law" means "all law" in the cessation passages, despite contextual indicators pointing to specific categories. | #1 (adding concept: "all law abolished"), #3 (external framework: unified-law theology) | Abolished | Tree 2: Source test -- "unified law" concept is NOT found in E/N tables. The E/N tables show distinct categories. -> External. Direction test -- overrides E010, E021, E143, E001-E009. -> I-D. Tree 5: IP2 -> ABOLISHED. -> Cross-ref Master I007 (already registered). |

### I-B Resolution Subsections

#### I-B Resolution: I3 -- Specific civil forms tied to the theocratic state

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (civil forms ceased): E18-E19 (theocratic framework established and rejected), N6 (NT transfers judicial function), E41 (Rom 13 -- government as God's minister without specifying Mosaic forms), E42 (1 Cor 6 -- church adjudicates without Mosaic procedure), E47 (dogma lexically includes civil decrees)
- AGAINST (civil forms persist): E31 ("throughout your generations"), N5 (NT applies two-witness rule), E43 (Jesus cites the moral-civil combination), E45 (judgment is a "weightier matter"), E49 (Heb 10:28 cites Mosaic civil penalty as baseline)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E18-E19 | Plain | The theocratic framework and its rejection are directly stated. |
| N6 | Contextually Clear | Paul's teaching on government and church judgment is direct, but the absence of Mosaic specifics requires contextual inference. |
| E41 | Plain | Rom 13:1-7 directly states government's judicial function without Mosaic forms. |
| E31 | Ambiguous | "Throughout your generations" is used for both perpetual (Decalogue) and covenantal-duration provisions (ceremonial). The scope is ambiguous. |
| N5 | Contextually Clear | The NT clearly applies the two-witness rule, but whether this means the civil law "continues" or the principle is adopted independently requires context. |
| E45 | Contextually Clear | Jesus classifies judgment as "weightier" but does not specify whether He means the mishpat system or the moral principle of justice. |
| E49 | Contextually Clear | The author uses the Mosaic penalty for argument but does not prescribe its reinstatement. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
The FOR side has one Plain statement (E41, Rom 13 does not prescribe Mosaic forms) and two Plain observations (E18-E19, the theocratic framework and its rejection). The AGAINST side has one Ambiguous statement (E31) and several Contextually Clear items (N5, E45, E49). The Plain statements favor the claim that the specific forms are not prescribed in the NT.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The clearer passages (Rom 13:1-7, which directly addresses the NT judicial arrangement without Mosaic specifics) govern the reading of the less clear (E31 "throughout your generations," which is ambiguous in scope). The NT applies PRINCIPLES from the civil law (two-witness rule, justice) without reinstating the FORMS (restitution multipliers, cities of refuge, 40-stripe limit, theocratic courts).

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate (common ground)**
The specific institutional forms of the civil law (theocratic court system, restitution formulas, cities of refuge, execution methods) are not prescribed in the NT. The NT transfers the judicial function to secular government and the church, applying underlying principles without reinstating Mosaic civil forms. The resolution is Moderate because the NT does apply some specific civil principles (two-witness rule), suggesting selective continuity of principles rather than wholesale abolition. Note: This item is classified Neutral (not Abolished) because both positions agree that civil laws in their specific theocratic form ceased -- this is common ground, not the Abolished position.

---

#### I-B Resolution: I4 -- Civil-ceremonial inseparability

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (ceremonial cessation entails civil cessation): N3 (Lev 6:1-7 requires both), E26 (dual remedy), E47 (dogma encompasses both categories)
- AGAINST (civil and ceremonial separable): E27 ("beside the ram" -- Num 5:7-8 distinguishes the two components), E54 (NT restitution language, Phm 1:19), E45 (judgment as "weightier matter"), Luk 19:8 (Zacchaeus' voluntary restitution in NT)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| N3 | Plain | The dual requirement is explicitly stated in Lev 6. |
| E27 | Plain | "Beside" (milled) explicitly separates the civil from the ceremonial component. |
| E54 | Contextually Clear | Paul uses restitution language without Mosaic framework. |
| E47 | Ambiguous | Dogma's range includes civil, but the Col 2 context specifies ceremonial referents. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
Both sides have Plain statements. N3 shows overlap; E27 shows separation. The overlap is real (Lev 6:1-7) but the text itself distinguishes the components ("beside the ram"). The question is whether overlap means inseparability.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
Num 5:7-8 (which separates the components: restitution "beside" the offering) interprets Lev 6:1-7 (which combines them). The clearer passage (Num 5, which explicitly separates) governs the less clear reading (that they are inseparable). Both are by the same author (Moses) on the same topic.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong against (the inseparability claim fails)**
The text itself distinguishes civil restitution from ceremonial offering ("beside the ram"). The overlap does not entail inseparability. The ceremonial component (trespass offering) can cease while the civil principle (restitution to the victim) endures independently. The NT confirms this: restitution language appears (Phm 1:19, Luk 19:8) without ceremonial accompaniment.

---

#### I-B Resolution: I6 -- Dogma includes civil law in Col 2:14

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (dogma includes civil): E47 (lexicon defines dogma as "civil, ceremonial or ecclesiastical")
- AGAINST (dogma limited to ceremonial in context): Col 2:16-17 context specifies "meat, drink, holyday, new moon, sabbath days" (all ceremonial); law-04 N018 (dogma/cheirographon never applied to the Decalogue)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E47 | Contextually Clear | The lexical range is factual, but which meaning applies depends on context. |
| Col 2:16-17 context | Plain | The contextual referents are explicitly ceremonial. |
| N018 | Plain | The vocabulary is never applied to the Decalogue. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
The contextual evidence (Plain: ceremonial referents specified) outweighs the lexical range (Contextually Clear: dogma CAN mean civil, but the context does not require it).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The specific context of Col 2:16-17 (Plain, listing ceremonial items) determines the reading of the broader term dogma in 2:14.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate toward Continues**
The context of Colossians 2 points to ceremonial regulations, not civil law. The lexical range of dogma includes civil decrees, but the context specifies ceremonial referents. The resolution is Moderate (not Strong) because the lexical possibility of civil inclusion cannot be fully excluded from the text.

---

#### I-B Resolution: I7 -- Jesus abolished the lex talionis

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (lex talionis abolished): E44 (Jesus contrasts "eye for eye" with "resist not evil," Mat 5:38-39)
- AGAINST (lex talionis not abolished): E021 in master (Jesus said "I am not come to destroy the law," Mat 5:17); the context addresses personal responses ("whosoever shall smite thee"), not the judicial system; E41 (Rom 13:4 -- the ruler still "beareth the sword" to punish evil)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E44 | Contextually Clear | Jesus addresses the lex talionis, but the context requires reading whether He addresses personal conduct or judicial administration. |
| E021 | Plain | "I am not come to destroy" is direct and unambiguous. |
| E41 | Plain | Rom 13:4 directly states the ruler punishes evil. |
| Context of Mat 5:39-42 | Contextually Clear | "Whosoever shall smite thee," "if any man will sue thee" -- second-person singular, personal scenarios. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
The AGAINST side has two Plain statements (E021, Mat 5:17; E41, Rom 13:4). The FOR side has one Contextually Clear item (E44). Plain outweighs Contextually Clear.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The clear statement "I am not come to destroy the law" (Mat 5:17, same discourse, same chapter) governs the reading of the "eye for eye" teaching (Mat 5:38-39). Jesus' own framework declares He is not abolishing the law. The "But I say unto you" passages deepen the personal application without destroying the legal principle.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong against (Jesus did not abolish the lex talionis)**
Jesus' explicit statement "I am not come to destroy the law" (same chapter, same discourse, Plain clarity) governs the reading of His teaching on "eye for eye." The context (personal responses: "smite thee," "sue thee") addresses individual conduct, not judicial administration. Rom 13:4 confirms that the civil punishment function continues under government authority.

### 4. Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements:**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases verse text. Checked.
- E45 (Mat 23:23, "weightier matters") is the only positional E-item (Continues). The text directly says judgment/justice is a "weightier matter of the law."

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items:**
- E45 (Continues) -- Tree 3 fully applied. V1: YES (law-continuation vocabulary: "weightier matters of the law" classifies judgment as enduringly important). Gates 1-4 all PASS as documented. Classification stands.
- All other E-items are Neutral. Verified: no continuation or cessation vocabulary in context.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications:**
- N1-N8 each follow unavoidably from cited E-items. The three N-tier tests applied via Gate 0.
- N2 (Continues): The Bible's use of functionally distinct terms for different types of law (mitsvah, choq, mishpat) constitutes a vocabulary distinction between law categories. The Continues position affirms this distinction; the Abolished position denies it. Classification as Continues verified.
- N5 (two-witness rule applied in NT): Could anyone deny this? No -- Jesus and Paul directly cite the OT standard. Verified.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test):**
- I1 (I-A): Components all from E/N. Verified.
- I2 (I-C): "Threefold division" label is external. Verified.
- I3 (I-B): Components from E/N on both sides. Verified.
- I4 (I-B): Components from E/N on both sides. Verified.
- I5 (I-A): Components all from E/N. Verified.
- I6 (I-B): Components from E/N on both sides. Verified.
- I7 (I-B): Components from E/N on both sides. Verified.
- I8 (I-D): "All law abolished" overrides E010, E021, E143. Verified.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test):**
- I1 (I-A): No E/N reinterpreted. Verified.
- I2 (I-C): No E/N overridden. Verified.
- I3 (I-B): E31 must be read as covenantal rather than perpetual. I-B confirmed.
- I4 (I-B): E27 must be overridden for the claim. I-B confirmed. (Resolved Strong against.)
- I5 (I-A): No E/N reinterpreted. Verified.
- I6 (I-B): Context must be extended beyond specified referents. I-B confirmed.
- I7 (I-B): E021 must be qualified. I-B confirmed.
- I8 (I-D): Multiple E/N overridden. I-D confirmed.

**Step E: Run consistency checks:**
- I1 (I-A): Only requires #5 (systematizing). Verified.
- I3 (I-B): E/N on both sides. Verified.
- I4 (I-B): E/N on both sides. Verified. (Resolved Strong against.)
- I5 (I-A): Only requires #5. Verified.
- I6 (I-B): E/N on both sides. Verified.
- I7 (I-B): E/N on both sides. Verified.
- I8 (I-D): Overrides E010, E021, E143. Verified.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections:**
- I3: Rom 13:1-7 (plain) governs "throughout your generations" (ambiguous). Documented.
- I4: Num 5:7-8 ("beside the ram," plain) interprets Lev 6:1-7 (combined). Documented.
- I6: Col 2:16-17 context (plain, ceremonial referents) governs dogma scope. Documented.
- I7: Mat 5:17 (plain, same chapter) governs Mat 5:38-39 reading. Documented.

### 5. Tally Summary

**This study's unique items (not already in master evidence file):**

- Explicit statements: 60 (of which 44 are new to this study, 16 already registered)
- Necessary implications: 8 (all new)
- Inferences: 8 (of which 6 are new, 2 already registered as I008 and I007)
  - I-A (Evidence-Extending): 2
  - I-B (Competing-Evidence): 4 (4 resolved: I3 Moderate toward Abolished, I4 Strong against, I6 Moderate toward Continues, I7 Strong against)
  - I-C (Compatible External): 1
  - I-D (Counter-Evidence External): 1

**Positional breakdown (this study):**

| Position | E | N | I-A | I-B | I-C | I-D | Total |
|----------|---|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Continues | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 |
| Abolished | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| Neutral | 59 | 7 | 0 | 4 | 1 | 0 | 71 |

Note: I3, I4, I6, and I7 were reclassified from Abolished to Neutral because they concern the cessation of civil/judicial laws in their specific theocratic form -- which both positions agree on (common ground per methodology IP0 check). Only I8 (I-D) remains Abolished because it claims the entire law system including the moral law was abolished. N2 was reclassified from Neutral to Continues because the Bible's use of functionally distinct terms for different types of law (mitsvah, choq, mishpat) constitutes a vocabulary distinction between law categories; the Continues position affirms this distinction while the Abolished position denies it. I-B resolutions: I3 (Moderate toward cessation of civil forms -- common ground), I4 (Strong against -- the inseparability claim fails), I6 (Moderate toward Continues reading of Col 2 context), I7 (Strong against -- Jesus did not abolish the lex talionis per Mat 5:17).

### 6. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

**What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):**

1. The Bible uses a distinct term (mishpat/mishpatim, H4941) for case law/judicial decisions, functionally different from mitsvah (direct command) and choq (enacted statute).
2. The mishpatim (Exo 21-23) were delivered through Moses as mediator (Stage 2a), not spoken directly by God like the Decalogue.
3. Deuteronomy 4:13-14 explicitly distinguishes "his covenant, even ten commandments" from "statutes and judgments" taught through Moses.
4. The mishpatim apply Decalogue moral principles to specific situations: murder law applies "Thou shalt not kill"; theft restitution applies "Thou shalt not steal"; parental offense penalties apply "Honour thy father and mother"; judicial procedure applies "Thou shalt not bear false witness."
5. The civil and ceremonial categories overlap in specific provisions (Lev 6:1-7 requires both civil restitution and a trespass offering), but the text itself distinguishes the two components ("beside the ram," Num 5:7-8).
6. The civil judicial principle predates the Mosaic system (Gen 9:5-6, grounded in the image of God).
7. Jesus classifies "judgment" (krisis, justice) as one of "the weightier matters of the law" (Mat 23:23).
8. The NT transfers the judicial function to secular government (Rom 13:1-7) and the church community (1 Cor 6:1-8) without prescribing specific Mosaic civil forms.
9. The NT applies some specific civil principles from the Mosaic system (two-or-three witness rule) in ecclesial contexts.
10. The mishpatim section (Exo 21-23) contains civil, moral, and ceremonial provisions intermingled; the text does not segregate them into separate codes.

**What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):**

1. It cannot be said that the Bible uses the label "civil" or "judicial" as a formal category name. The threefold division (moral/ceremonial/civil) uses external labels (I-C).
2. It cannot be said that the mishpatim are exclusively civil -- they contain ceremonial and moral provisions as well (Exo 22:29-30; 23:14-19).
3. It cannot be said that the civil and ceremonial categories are entirely inseparable. Num 5:7-8 explicitly separates them ("beside the ram").
4. It cannot be said that the specific Mosaic civil forms (restitution formulas, cities of refuge, 40-stripe limit, theocratic court system) are prescribed in the NT. The NT applies principles without reinstating forms.
5. It cannot be said that Jesus abolished the lex talionis. Mat 5:17 (same discourse) says He did not come to destroy the law, and the context addresses personal conduct.
6. It cannot be said that the dogmata (ordinances) nailed to the cross (Col 2:14) specifically include civil laws -- the contextual referents are ceremonial.
7. It cannot be said that the moral principles underlying civil law (justice, proportionality, human dignity, individual responsibility) have been abolished -- the NT affirms them.
8. It cannot be said that the civil law is identical to the ceremonial law simply because both are "Stage 2" mediated legislation. The Bible uses different vocabulary (mishpat vs. choq vs. chuqqah) and the provisions serve different functions.
9. It cannot be said that the civil laws were universal in their specific form -- they presuppose Israel's theocratic national structure, which the text itself records as rejected (1 Sa 8:7).
