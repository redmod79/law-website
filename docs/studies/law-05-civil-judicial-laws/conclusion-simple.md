# Civil and Judicial Laws in the Bible: What the Scriptures Actually Say

## A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence

---

When God gave His law at Mount Sinai, He did not merely give the Ten Commandments. He also gave Moses a detailed body of "judgments" -- practical laws dealing with courts, penalties, property disputes, theft, treatment of servants, protection of the poor, and the administration of justice in everyday life. These civil and judicial laws make up a large portion of the legislation in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.

The question is straightforward: where did these laws come from, how do they relate to the moral commandments, what happened to them when Israel ceased to be a nation under God's direct rule, and which principles carry forward into the New Testament? This study examines what the Bible itself says -- and what it does not say -- about its own civil and judicial legislation.

## The Bible Uses Distinct Terms for Different Kinds of Law

One of the most important observations from the biblical text is that it does not treat all its laws as a single undifferentiated mass. The Bible consistently uses at least three distinct Hebrew terms for different types of legislation: *mitsvah* (commandment), *choq* (statute or decree), and *mishpat* (judgment or case law). These three terms appear together repeatedly in a formula that treats them as related but distinguishable:

> "I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them." (Deuteronomy 5:31)

This three-term pattern is not a one-time occurrence. It appears across multiple legislative contexts in the Pentateuch, pointing to real functional distinctions in how the Bible organizes its own law.

Moses himself drew the sharpest distinction between the Ten Commandments and the civil laws. God spoke the Decalogue directly to all the people and wrote it on stone tablets with His own finger. The civil laws, by contrast, were delivered through Moses as a mediator:

> "And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments." (Deuteronomy 4:13-14)

The "his covenant, even ten commandments" is set apart from the "statutes and judgments" that God commanded Moses to teach. This is Moses' most explicit statement about the relationship between the Decalogue and the rest of the law. The civil laws themselves are introduced with their own distinct heading:

> "Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them." (Exodus 21:1)

What follows in Exodus 21-23 is a body of case law covering murder, assault, theft, property damage, lending, treatment of strangers, judicial procedures, and more.

## Civil Laws as Applications of the Ten Commandments

The civil laws are not random regulations. They consistently take the moral principles of the Ten Commandments and work out how those principles apply in real-life situations within Israelite society.

The commandment "Thou shalt not kill" is applied in the civil law that specifies the penalty for murder and distinguishes it from accidental killing:

> "He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death. And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee." (Exodus 21:12-13)

The commandment "Thou shalt not steal" is worked out in detailed restitution formulas:

> "If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep." (Exodus 22:1)

The commandment "Honour thy father and thy mother" stands behind the civil penalties for violence against parents:

> "And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death." (Exodus 21:15)

And the commandment against bearing false witness is the moral foundation for court procedure rules:

> "Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness." (Exodus 23:1)

The civil law also established the famous principle of proportional justice:

> "Life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot." (Exodus 21:23-25)

This consistent pattern reveals that the civil laws function as case-law applications of the Decalogue's moral principles to specific judicial situations. The moral principles are universal; the civil applications are tailored to the social context.

## Justice Before Moses

The principle of civil justice did not begin at Mount Sinai. Long before the Mosaic law was given, God established a foundational judicial principle with Noah -- addressed to the entire human race, not just Israel:

> "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man." (Genesis 9:5-6)

This is capital punishment for murder, delegated to human agency, and grounded not in any national covenant but in the image of God -- a universal reality that predates Israel. The principle that human beings are responsible for administering justice is older than the Mosaic system itself.

Even the practical structure of courts and judges was established before Sinai. When Jethro advised Moses to appoint judges at multiple levels, this judicial infrastructure was created before the law was given:

> "Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens." (Exodus 18:21)

## Where Civil and Ceremonial Laws Overlap -- but Remain Distinguishable

The civil and ceremonial categories are not always neatly separable. Within the very same sections that deal with theft, assault, and property disputes, the Bible also places laws about sacrifices, feasts, and firstfruits offerings. The categories are intermingled in the text.

A striking example of this overlap appears in Leviticus, where the same offense requires both a civil remedy for the victim and a religious offering to God:

> "He shall restore that which he took violently away...and shall add the fifth part more thereto...And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without blemish." (Leviticus 6:4-6)

For a civil wrong like theft or fraud, the offender had to make restitution to the victim (a civil matter) and also bring a sacrifice to God (a ceremonial matter). Both were required for the same offense.

However, the Bible itself distinguishes these two components. In Numbers, the same dual requirement is described, but the language explicitly separates the civil and ceremonial parts:

> "He shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth part thereof...beside the ram of the atonement." (Numbers 5:7-8)

The word "beside" is key. The civil restitution is "beside" -- separate from -- the ceremonial offering. They are combined in practice, but they are not the same thing. This means the cessation of the sacrificial system does not automatically dissolve the principle of making a wronged person whole.

## The Theocratic Framework and Its End

The civil laws presupposed Israel's unique status as a theocracy -- a nation under God's direct rule:

> "Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation." (Exodus 19:6)

Within this framework, the judicial system operated at multiple levels, with principles of justice that reflect God's own character: impartiality, individual responsibility, proportionality, and human dignity:

> "Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour." (Leviticus 19:15)

> "The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin." (Deuteronomy 24:16)

> "Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed...then thy brother should seem vile unto thee." (Deuteronomy 25:3)

Even punishment had limits, grounded in the offender's dignity as a "brother."

This theocratic arrangement was not permanent. Israel rejected it and demanded a human king:

> "And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them." (1 Samuel 8:7)

God Himself acknowledged that the people were rejecting His direct rule. This fundamentally changed the governmental framework within which the civil laws operated.

## The New Testament Transfers the Judicial Function

When we turn to the New Testament, the judicial function is not abolished -- it is transferred to two institutions.

First, secular government takes over the role of punishing wrongdoing:

> "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God... For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil." (Romans 13:1, 4)

Paul calls civil rulers "the minister of God" with authority to punish evil. The authority comes from God, but the specific Mosaic forms are not prescribed.

Second, the church community handles disputes among believers:

> "Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you...that shall be able to judge between his brethren?" (1 Corinthians 6:5)

Paul expected Christians to resolve disputes internally rather than through secular courts, establishing church judgment as the appropriate mechanism for intra-community matters.

The New Testament also directly applies specific principles from the Mosaic civil law. The two-or-three witness requirement from Deuteronomy 19:15 appears in multiple contexts. Jesus applied it to church discipline:

> "But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established." (Matthew 18:16)

Paul applied the same rule to accusations against church elders:

> "Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses." (1 Timothy 5:19)

These examples show the New Testament adopting procedural principles from the civil law while expressing them through different institutional structures.

## Jesus and the Civil Law

Jesus' teaching on the civil laws deserves careful attention. He referenced both the moral commandment and its civil penalty together:

> "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment." (Matthew 5:21)

He also addressed the principle of proportional justice:

> "Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also." (Matthew 5:38-39)

Some have taken this to mean Jesus abolished the "eye for an eye" principle. But the context is critical. Jesus is addressing personal responses -- "whosoever shall smite thee," "if any man will sue thee" -- using second-person singular language about individual conduct, not about the judicial system's administration of justice. And in the very same sermon, Jesus explicitly stated:

> "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil." (Matthew 5:17)

Jesus' own framework declaration -- that He did not come to destroy the law -- governs the reading of His teaching on proportional justice. He deepens the personal application without dismantling the judicial principle.

Perhaps most significantly, Jesus classified justice itself as one of the enduring priorities of God's law:

> "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith." (Matthew 23:23)

He called "judgment" -- justice -- one of "the weightier matters of the law," a designation that indicates its continuing significance above lesser provisions.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

Several common assumptions about civil law lack biblical support:

**The Bible does not use the term "civil law" as a formal category name.** The threefold division into moral, ceremonial, and civil law uses labels drawn from systematic theology, not from the biblical text. The Bible does use functionally distinct terms (*mishpatim* for judgments, *chuqqim* for statutes, *mitsvot* for commandments) that are compatible with this framework, but the specific labels "moral," "ceremonial," and "civil" are organizational tools applied to the text, not found within it.

**The Bible does not teach that the mishpatim contain only civil provisions.** Exodus 21-23 intermingles civil penalties, ceremonial requirements (feast laws, firstfruits offerings), and moral exhortations. The text does not segregate these into separate codes.

**The Bible does not say civil and ceremonial categories are completely inseparable.** Despite overlap in some provisions, Numbers 5:7-8 explicitly separates the civil component from the ceremonial component ("beside the ram of the atonement"). Restitution language also appears in the New Testament without any ceremonial accompaniment (Philemon 1:19; Luke 19:8).

**The Bible does not prescribe specific Mosaic civil forms for the New Testament era.** The particular restitution multipliers, cities of refuge, forty-stripe limit, and theocratic court system are not reinstated in the New Testament. The New Testament applies underlying principles without requiring the specific institutional structures.

**The Bible does not say Jesus abolished the "eye for an eye" principle.** His teaching in Matthew 5:38-39 addresses personal conduct in the context of the same discourse where He explicitly says He did not come to destroy the law (Matthew 5:17). Romans 13:4 confirms that civil punishment continues under government authority.

**The Bible does not say the "ordinances" nailed to the cross in Colossians 2:14 specifically include civil laws.** The contextual referents in Colossians 2:16-17 -- meat, drink, holy days, new moons, sabbath days -- are ceremonial, not civil.

**The Bible does not say the moral principles underlying civil law were abolished.** Justice, proportionality, human dignity, individual responsibility, and protection of the vulnerable are affirmed throughout the New Testament.

**The Bible does not say civil laws were universal in their specific form.** They presupposed Israel's theocratic national structure, which the Bible itself records as rejected when Israel demanded a king "like all the nations" (1 Samuel 8:20).

## Conclusion

The biblical evidence shows that the civil and judicial laws occupy a distinct place within Old Testament legislation. The *mishpatim* represent case-law applications of the Ten Commandments' moral principles to specific situations within Israel's theocratic society. They share the mediator (Moses) and the medium (written in a book) with the ceremonial system, but they serve a fundamentally different purpose: administering justice rather than regulating worship.

The moral principles underlying the civil laws -- justice, fairness, proportionality, human dignity, individual responsibility, and protection of the vulnerable -- are grounded in realities that predate the Mosaic system. Capital punishment for murder was established with Noah on the basis of the image of God (Genesis 9:5-6). Jesus Himself classified "judgment" as one of "the weightier matters of the law" (Matthew 23:23). These principles endure because they reflect God's unchanging character.

The specific institutional forms of the Mosaic civil system -- theocratic courts, restitution multipliers, cities of refuge, the forty-stripe limit -- are not prescribed in the New Testament. Instead, the judicial function is transferred to secular government (Romans 13:1-7) and the church community (1 Corinthians 6:1-8), with the underlying principles intact but the specific forms adapted to new contexts. The New Testament selectively applies certain civil principles (the two-witness rule appears in Matthew 18:16, 2 Corinthians 13:1, and 1 Timothy 5:19) while not reinstating the broader institutional framework.

What the evidence supports is that the civil laws were real applications of real moral principles, that those moral principles endure, and that the specific civil forms were tied to a national arrangement the Bible itself records as having passed away. The principles remain; the forms have been transferred to new institutions under God's ongoing authority.
