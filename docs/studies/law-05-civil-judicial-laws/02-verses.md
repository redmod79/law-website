**Romans 13:4** For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to [execute] wrath upon him that doeth evil.
**Romans 13:5** Wherefore [ye] must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.

**1 Corinthians 6:6** But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
**1 Corinthians 6:7** Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather [suffer yourselves to] be defrauded?
