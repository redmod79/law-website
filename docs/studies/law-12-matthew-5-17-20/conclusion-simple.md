# What Does Jesus Mean by "Not Come to Destroy but to Fulfil"?

## A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence

In Matthew 5:17-20, Jesus makes what may be His most direct recorded statement about the law. He says He did not come to destroy it. He says not even the smallest detail of it will pass away. He says that anyone who breaks even the least commandment -- and teaches others to do the same -- will be called least in His kingdom. And He says His followers need a righteousness that goes deeper than the Pharisees ever achieved.

This study examines what Jesus actually said in these four verses, what the words He chose mean in their original language, and how the rest of the New Testament confirms or develops those statements.

## Jesus Chose the Strongest Word for "Destroy" -- and Denied It Twice

The first thing to notice is the force of Jesus' denial. He does not say, "I have come to adjust the law," or "I have come to transition away from it." He says:

> "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil." -- Matthew 5:17

The Greek word translated "destroy" here is *kataluo*. It appears 17 times in the New Testament. In every use outside of its simple meaning of "lodging" somewhere, it means to demolish, tear down, overthrow, or annul. It is used for tearing down a temple stone by stone. It is used for overthrowing a movement. It is used for annulling customs. It is never used to mean "bring to completion" or "gently set aside."

Jesus picked this word -- the strongest available term for total demolition -- and then denied it with emphasis. He said, "Think not" (do not even suppose this), and then restated the denial: "I am not come to destroy." This is a double denial using the most forceful language available.

It is worth noting that when Stephen was later accused of teaching that Jesus would "destroy" the temple customs, the same Greek word was used:

> "We have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us." -- Acts 6:14

The early church treated this charge as false. The word *kataluo* applied to the law meant annulment -- and Jesus had explicitly said this was not His purpose.

## What Does "Fulfil" Mean?

The word translated "fulfil" is *pleroo*. It appears about 90 times in the New Testament with several distinct uses: it can mean to fill something up (like filling a net with fish), to accomplish a task, to bring a prophecy to realization, or to make something full in quality and meaning. The question is which sense Jesus intended when He said He came to "fulfil" the law.

Several lines of evidence point toward the meaning "to fill the law with its fullest, deepest meaning":

**First**, the very next verses affirm the law's permanence and continuing authority. If "fulfil" meant "complete and then terminate," Jesus would be contradicting Himself within the same sentence. He says He came to fulfil the law, and then immediately says not a single detail of it will pass away.

**Second**, the same author -- Matthew -- uses the identical Greek form just three chapters earlier, when Jesus explains why He should be baptized:

> "Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness." -- Matthew 3:15

Here, "fulfil all righteousness" clearly means to accomplish or carry out what God's righteousness requires -- not to terminate righteousness. The same author, using the same word form only three chapters apart, favors the same meaning.

**Third**, the six examples Jesus gives immediately after (known as the antitheses, in verses 21-48) show what this "fulfilling" looks like in practice. In every case, Jesus takes an existing commandment and deepens it. He does not replace or revoke a single one.

**Fourth**, the prophet Isaiah had already predicted this pattern:

> "The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable." -- Isaiah 42:21

Matthew himself identifies Jesus as the Servant described in Isaiah 42, quoting from that very chapter and applying it to Jesus (Matthew 12:17-21). The Servant's role was to magnify the law -- to make it greater, not smaller. That is precisely what the antitheses demonstrate.

**Fifth**, the apostle Paul repeatedly uses the same word for ongoing law-fulfillment through love and the Spirit:

> "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." -- Romans 8:4

> "For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." -- Galatians 5:14

> "Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law." -- Romans 13:10

In each case, Paul describes believers fulfilling the law through love and the Spirit's power -- an ongoing, present-tense activity, not a past termination event.

## Not One Detail Will Pass Away

Jesus follows His statement about fulfilling the law with one of the most emphatic declarations in the Gospels:

> "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." -- Matthew 5:18

A "jot" refers to the smallest Hebrew letter (yod), and a "tittle" refers to a tiny stroke that distinguishes one letter from another. Jesus is saying that not even the smallest written detail of the law will be removed. And He ties this permanence to the duration of the physical universe -- "till heaven and earth pass."

The phrase "in no wise" translates a double negative construction in Greek, which is the strongest possible way to deny something. It expresses emphatic impossibility: this will absolutely not happen.

Luke records a parallel statement that reinforces this:

> "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail." -- Luke 16:17

Luke's version contains only the cosmic condition -- the law will not fail until heaven and earth do. This parallel helps clarify that Jesus is speaking about the law's endurance across the entire span of this present creation.

## The Commandments Are the Kingdom's Standard

Jesus then draws a direct connection between the commandments and standing in His kingdom:

> "Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven." -- Matthew 5:19

Several things stand out here. The word "therefore" links this statement directly to what came before -- the permanence of the law. "These least commandments" refers back to "the law" just mentioned in verses 17-18. If even the least commandment matters, the greater commandments are all the more binding.

Both the commandment-breaker and the commandment-keeper are described as being within the kingdom. The consequence is not exclusion but rank: "least" versus "great." This presupposes that the commandments are still in force as the operating standard of the kingdom. A standard that no longer applies could not serve as the basis for determining someone's standing.

The word for "break" in verse 19 shares the same Greek root as "destroy" in verse 17. Breaking individual commandments is the personal-scale version of what Jesus denied doing at the large scale. He will not demolish the law wholesale, and His followers should not break it piece by piece.

## The Antitheses: Deepening, Not Replacing

In the verses that follow (Matthew 5:21-48), Jesus gives six examples that show what it looks like to fulfil the law. Each one follows a pattern: "Ye have heard that it was said... but I say unto you..." In every case, the direction is toward greater moral depth, not toward relaxation or replacement.

The first two examples quote directly from the Ten Commandments:

> "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill... But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment." -- Matthew 5:21-22

> "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart." -- Matthew 5:27-28

Jesus does not set aside these commandments. He extends them. The command against murder now reaches to unjust anger. The command against adultery now reaches to lustful intent. The law is not weakened; it is deepened to address the heart, not merely outward behavior.

On divorce, Jesus addresses what He Himself later calls a concession that Moses allowed "because of the hardness of your hearts" (Matthew 19:8). He does not override divine law but restores the original creation standard: what God joined together, let not man put asunder.

On oaths, Jesus deepens the truthfulness requirement from formal oath-keeping to complete honesty in all speech. On retaliation, the "eye for an eye" principle was a judicial courtroom standard (Deuteronomy 19:15-21), not a rule for personal relationships. The personal standard had always been "thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (Leviticus 19:18). Jesus addresses personal conduct.

On love for enemies, Jesus corrects a scribal addition. The command "love thy neighbour" comes from Scripture, but the phrase "and hate thine enemy" does not appear anywhere in the Old Testament. Jesus strips away human tradition and extends love to its fullest scope.

In every antithesis, Jesus magnifies the law -- exactly as Isaiah 42:21 had predicted the Servant would do.

## A Deeper Righteousness

Jesus concludes the preamble with a statement that sets the bar:

> "For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven." -- Matthew 5:20

The Pharisees were known for meticulous external law-keeping. Jesus elsewhere described their problem:

> "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity." -- Matthew 23:27-28

The exceeding righteousness Jesus demands is not a different set of rules. It is the same law obeyed from the heart rather than performed for show. This aligns with the promise of the new covenant, where God would internalize His law:

> "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts." -- Jeremiah 31:33

Paul describes this same reality for believers:

> "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." -- Romans 8:4

The righteousness that exceeds the Pharisees' is Spirit-empowered, internal obedience to the same law they kept only on the surface.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

While the evidence from Matthew 5:17-20 and its supporting passages is substantial, there are limits to what can be claimed from this text alone:

**This passage does not resolve every question about the law by itself.** It is one of many passages that address the topic, and it must be read alongside the rest of Scripture.

**The word "fulfil" cannot be reduced to only one meaning to the absolute exclusion of all others.** The word has a range. The context strongly favors "fill full with deepest meaning," but the prophetic-fulfillment sense (that Jesus brings to reality what the law and prophets pointed toward) is also present in Matthew's broader usage. Both senses may coexist: Jesus fulfilled what the law and prophets foretold about Him, AND He filled the moral law with its fullest, deepest meaning.

**The phrase "till all be fulfilled" in verse 18 does not clearly specify a single event** -- whether the cross, the resurrection, the second coming, or another moment. The parallel in Luke 16:17 points toward the law enduring as long as the present creation does, but the text does not name a date.

**The antitheses do not address every category of law equally.** Some deal with the Ten Commandments, some with civil provisions, and some with traditions that had been added to Scripture. The passage does not, by itself, settle exactly which regulations fall under "the law" in every specific case.

**It cannot be said that Jesus abolished any commandment in this passage.** No abolished-direction statement appears anywhere in these four verses. The claim that "fulfil" means "complete and terminate" requires adding a concept the text does not contain, while overriding what the text explicitly states in the very next verse.

## Conclusion

Matthew 5:17-20 presents Jesus' own declaration about His relationship to the law. He denied, in the strongest possible terms, that He came to demolish or annul it. He affirmed that it would endure down to its smallest detail as long as heaven and earth stand. He declared that keeping or breaking even its least commandments has direct consequences for standing in His kingdom. And He called for a righteousness that goes deeper than external rule-keeping -- the same law, obeyed from the heart.

The six examples that follow demonstrate what this looks like: every commandment is deepened, extended to the level of thought and motive, and magnified in scope. None is revoked. Paul confirms this pattern, describing believers as those in whom "the righteousness of the law" is "fulfilled" through the Spirit. And Paul, asked directly whether faith makes the law void, gives the plainest possible answer:

> "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." -- Romans 3:31

The biblical evidence from this passage, taken on its own terms, points consistently in one direction: Jesus came not to end the law but to reveal its fullest meaning, to magnify it as Isaiah had foretold, and to empower His followers to keep it from the heart.
