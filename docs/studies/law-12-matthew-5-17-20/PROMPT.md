# Bible Study: Matthew 5:17-20 -- "Not Come to Destroy but to Fulfil"

## Question
In Matthew 5:17-20, Jesus declares He came "not to destroy, but to fulfil" the law, states "till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law," warns that breaking "one of these least commandments" affects kingdom status, and demands righteousness "exceeding the scribes and Pharisees." What do these four verses actually say about the continuity, authority, and scope of the law? Specifically:

1. What are the semantic ranges of kataluo (G2647, "destroy") and pleroo (G4137, "fulfil") in their NT usage, and what does Jesus' contrast between them communicate?
2. What does the permanence statement ("till heaven and earth pass") mean for the duration of the law?
3. What are "these least commandments" (v. 19), and what does the warning about breaking and teaching them imply?
4. How do the six antitheses (Mat 5:21-48) that follow relate to vv. 17-20 -- does Jesus replace, intensify, or magnify the law?
5. What kind of "righteousness" exceeds the scribes and Pharisees (v. 20)?

This study is part of the law series (law-01 through law-12). The investigative framework is defined in `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-series-methodology.md`.

- Mat 24:2; Mar 13:2; Luk 21:6 -- "thrown down" (temple stones)

- Acts 5:38-39 -- "if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it"
- Acts 6:14 -- "Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place"
- Rom 14:20 -- "destroy not the work of God"
- 2Co 5:1 -- "if our earthly house...were dissolved"
- Gal 2:18 -- "if I build again the things which I destroyed"

**Key pleroo (G4137) occurrences to examine:**
- Mat 5:17 -- "not to destroy, but to fulfil"
- Mat 1:22; 2:15, 17, 23; 4:14; 8:17; 12:17; 13:35; 21:4; 26:54, 56; 27:9 -- Matthew's "that it might be fulfilled" formula

- Col 1:25 -- "to fulfil the word of God"

**Key luo (G3089) vs. kataluo (G2647) distinction:**
- luo (G3089) = "to loosen" (Mat 5:19 "break")
- kataluo (G2647) = "to loosen down completely / demolish" (Mat 5:17 "destroy")
- Both words appear in the same pericope (vv. 17, 19), suggesting Jesus uses them with distinct but related senses

**Key Findings from Prior Study Conclusions:**

**law-01 (God's Moral Law):**
- Mat 5:17-18 registered as **E21** (Continues): "V1: YES -- 'not come to destroy [the law]'; 'shall in no wise pass from the law.' Gate 1: PASS -- 'the law' is Jesus' subject; context (vv. 19-48) shows He addresses specific commandments."
- Mat 5:19 registered as **E43** (Continues): "'these...commandments' in context of vv. 17-18 (the law)."
- Isa 42:21 registered as **E44** (Continues): "'magnify the law' = the opposite of abolishing it."
- The study established 46 Continues E-items and 0 Abolished E-items.
- Seven unique markers distinguish the Decalogue from other legislation.

**law-08 (Abolished at Cross):**
- Mat 5:17-18 registered as **E14** (Continues): "katalusai is unambiguous denial."
- Mat 5:19 registered as **E15** (Continues): "'these commandments' refers to the law just mentioned (vv.17-18)."
- None of the seven primary NT abolition passages names the Decalogue as the thing abolished.
- Greek vocabulary dogma (G1378) used for what was abolished is never used for the Decalogue.
- Cheirographon = "hand-written" vs. Decalogue = "finger of God."
- I-B Resolution for I3 rates Mat 5:17-18 as "Plain" clarity level.

**law-11 (Written on Hearts):**
- Four convergent textual markers identify the Decalogue as the law written on hearts.
- The kathab/grapho verb connection links Deu 10:4 (Decalogue-writing) to Jer 31:33 (heart-writing).
- Heb 10:1-16 removes the sacrificial system while affirming law written on hearts.
- The possessive pronoun "MY law" in Jer 31:33 / Heb 8:10 / 10:16 identifies pre-existing law.

**law-03 (Exodus 20 vs Later Laws):**
- Five textual dimensions distinguish the Decalogue from subsequent legislation: speaker, medium, repository, completeness formula, and naming.

**law-04 (Ceremonial Laws):**
- Ceremonial laws distinguished from moral law through shadow/type terminology.

**law-09 (Old Covenant / New Covenant):**
- Law content is constant between covenants; the arrangement/administration changes.

**law-10 (New Covenant and Law):**
- New covenant writes the same law on hearts -- the change is in location and power, not content.

### Focus Areas

These focus areas are derived from tool discoveries, not pre-assumed:

1. **kataluo (G2647) semantic range**: The tool discovered 17 NT occurrences with meanings spanning "demolish, dissolve, throw down, destroy, overthrow, come to nought." All carry the sense of complete undoing/dismantling. Jesus' use in Mat 5:17 with emphatic denial ("Think not...I am not come to destroy") must be analyzed against this full semantic range. Compare with luo (G3089) in v. 19 ("break/loosen").

2. **pleroo (G4137) semantic range**: The tool discovered 90 NT occurrences with meanings spanning "fill up, make replete, furnish, satisfy, execute, finish, verify/coincide with a prediction." Matthew's repeated use in his fulfillment formula ("that it might be fulfilled") is a critical contextual parallel. Does Jesus "fulfil" the law by completing it (temporal), by filling it full of meaning (qualitative), or by accomplishing what it pointed to (prophetic)?

3. **Permanence statement scope (v. 18)**: "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." Two temporal clauses: "till heaven and earth pass" and "till all be fulfilled." How do these relate? What is "all" (panta)?

4. **"Least commandments" identity (v. 19)**: luo (G3089) is used for "break." Nave's COMMANDMENTS topic points to specific commandments. The warning links commandment-breaking to kingdom status. What are "these least commandments" in context?

5. **Isa 42:21 connection**: Tool discovered E44 -- "He will magnify the law, and make it honourable." This Messianic prophecy parallels the claim that Jesus came to "fulfil" (pleroo) the law. The antitheses (Mat 5:21-48) may demonstrate this magnification.

6. **Nave's "TEMPORARY" classification**: The LAW topic in Nave's places Mat 5:17-45 under a "TEMPORARY" heading. This editorial classification should be examined against the actual text of Matthew 5:17-20 (which contains some of the strongest law-permanence language in the NT).

7. **Righteousness exceeding Pharisees (v. 20)**: dikaiosune (G1343) appears 92 times in the NT. Nave's PHARISEES and RIGHTEOUSNESS topics intersect at Mat 5:20. What kind of righteousness exceeds Pharisaic righteousness? How does this connect to the antitheses that follow?

8. **The six antitheses (Mat 5:21-48)**: Nave's PRECEPTS OF JESUS section lists Mat 5:22-48 as Jesus' direct teaching. The formula "ye have heard...but I say unto you" -- does Jesus replace, correct, intensify, or magnify OT commands? How do the antitheses relate to the programmatic statement of vv. 17-20?

9. **Prior registration of Mat 5:17-19**: law-01 already classified E21 (Mat 5:17-18) and E43 (Mat 5:19) as Continues. law-08 also registered E14-E15 for the same verses. This study should conduct the deepest analysis yet of these verses, examining all exegetical details and alternative interpretations before re-confirming or adjusting the classification.
