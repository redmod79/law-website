## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Matthew 5:17 -- "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."

**Context:** Jesus is delivering the Sermon on the Mount (Mat 5-7) to His disciples and the multitudes (5:1-2). This statement follows the Beatitudes (5:3-12) and the salt/light imagery (5:13-16). It serves as the programmatic introduction to vv. 17-48, where Jesus will address the law's authority before demonstrating His relationship to it through six antitheses (5:21-48).

**Direct statement:** Jesus makes two claims: (1) a negative denial -- He did NOT come to destroy (katalusai, G2647) the law or the prophets; (2) a positive affirmation -- He came to fulfil (plerosai, G4137) the law and the prophets. The denial is emphatic: "Think not" (me nomisete) warns against a false assumption.

**Key observations:**

1. **Kataluo (G2647) semantic range:** The word study data shows 17 NT occurrences. In non-lodging uses, the meaning is consistently "demolish, overthrow, tear down, bring to nothing." Physical uses describe temple demolition (Mat 24:2; 26:61; 27:40; Mrk 13:2; 14:58; 15:29; Luk 21:6). Figurative uses describe undoing or annulling (Acts 5:38-39; 6:14; Rom 14:20; 2 Cor 5:1; Gal 2:18). None of the 17 uses means "bring to fulfillment," "complete," or "supersede." Jesus uses the strongest available word for demolition/annulment and denies it twice in one verse. The compound kata + luo (loosen down completely) intensifies the simple verb luo used in v. 19.

2. **Pleroo (G4137) semantic range:** The word appears 90 times in the NT. Four semantic clusters emerge: (a) prophetic fulfillment -- Matthew's "that it might be fulfilled" formula (12+ times); (b) filling up / making full (literally); (c) accomplishing / completing a task or period; (d) making full in quality (spiritual fullness). The question is which sense applies in Mat 5:17.

3. **Contextual determination of pleroo's meaning:** The immediate context (vv. 18-19) emphasizes the law's continuing validity ("not one jot or tittle shall pass," "whosoever shall break...least commandments"). The antitheses (vv. 21-48) demonstrate not replacement but deepening -- extending commandments to heart-level application. Matthew 3:15 uses the identical Greek form (plerosai, Aorist Active Infinitive) for "to fulfil all righteousness" -- meaning to perform/accomplish what God's righteousness requires, not to terminate it. The same author uses the same form with the same semantic force within three chapters. Romans 8:4 ("the righteousness of the law fulfilled in us") and Galatians 5:14 ("all the law is fulfilled in one word...love thy neighbour") both use pleroo for ongoing, present-tense law-fulfillment by believers through love -- not termination. If pleroo meant "complete and terminate," Paul's statements would mean that love terminates the law, which contradicts the same author's "we establish the law" (Rom 3:31).

4. **Connection to Isaiah 42:21:** Matthew 12:17-21 explicitly identifies Jesus as the Servant of Isaiah 42:1-4. Isaiah 42:21 states: "He will magnify the law, and make it honourable." The Hebrew gadal ("magnify") means to make great, enlarge, amplify. The Servant magnifies the law -- the opposite of diminishing or abolishing it. The antitheses that follow Mat 5:17 demonstrate this magnification: taking each commandment and revealing its full, deepest moral scope.

5. **Acts 6:14 parallel:** The word kataluo appears in Acts 6:14 as the accusation against Stephen: "This Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy (katalusei) this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us." The same word Jesus denied in Mat 5:17 appears as a false charge against Him by those who claimed He would abolish Mosaic practice. This shows that the early church understood kataluo as meaning to abolish/annul -- precisely what Jesus denied.

6. **The phrase "the law or the prophets":** This is a standard Jewish designation for the Hebrew Scriptures (cf. Mat 7:12; 11:13; 22:40; Luk 16:16; Acts 24:14; Rom 3:21). Jesus addresses the entire OT revelation -- both the Torah and the prophetic writings.

**Cross-references:**
- Luk 16:17 parallels the permanence statement: "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."
- Rom 3:31: "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."
- Rom 8:4: "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us."
- Gal 5:14: "All the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."

### Matthew 5:18 -- "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."

**Context:** This verse begins with "For" (gar), connecting it as the reason/ground for v. 17. The solemn formula "Verily I say unto you" (amen lego humin) marks this as an authoritative declaration.

**Direct statement:** Jesus declares the law's permanence using the strongest possible language: (1) the cosmic benchmark -- "till heaven and earth pass"; (2) the smallest units -- "one jot or one tittle" (the smallest Hebrew letter and the smallest stroke distinguishing similar letters); (3) the absolute denial -- "shall in no wise pass" (ou me, the strongest form of negation in Greek, a double negative = emphatic impossibility).

**Key observations:**

1. **Two "until" clauses:** The verse contains two temporal markers: (a) "till heaven and earth pass" (heos an parelthe ho ouranos kai he ge); (b) "till all be fulfilled" (heos an panta genetai). The second clause uses ginomai (G1096, "come to pass"), not pleroo (G4137, the prophetic-fulfillment word). This is a significant lexical choice. If Jesus intended the prophetic-fulfillment sense, He had the word pleroo available (having just used it in v. 17). Instead, He chose the general "come to pass" verb. The second clause adds reinforcement to the first -- both conditions must be met before anything passes from the law.

2. **Cosmic permanence:** Jesus ties the law's duration to the duration of the physical cosmos. Heaven and earth have not passed. Luke 16:17 is the parallel: "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail." The comparison makes the law's endurance MORE certain than cosmic permanence. Matthew 24:35 uses similar language: "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."

3. **Scope of "the law":** The phrase "the law" (tou nomou) in v. 18 refers to the same entity as "the law" in v. 17 -- "the law or the prophets." The context (v. 19) immediately applies this to specific "commandments," indicating that the moral content of the law is in view.

4. **"Jot and tittle":** The jot (iota) is the smallest Hebrew letter (yod). The tittle (keraia) is the small stroke or serif that distinguishes similar Hebrew letters (e.g., beth from kaph, daleth from resh). Jesus addresses even the most minute element of the law's written expression.

**Cross-references:**
- Luk 16:17: Parallel permanence statement with only the cosmic condition, no second clause.
- Psa 119:89: "For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven."
- Psa 111:7-8: "All his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever."
- Isa 40:8: "The word of our God shall stand for ever."

### Matthew 5:19 -- "Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."

**Context:** "Therefore" (oun) draws the practical consequence from vv. 17-18. Since Jesus did not come to destroy the law (v. 17) and since the law endures till heaven and earth pass (v. 18), therefore...

**Direct statement:** Jesus establishes a double standard: (1) breaking (luo) even the least commandment and teaching others to do so results in being called "least" in the kingdom; (2) doing and teaching the commandments results in being called "great" in the kingdom. Both outcomes are within the kingdom -- kingdom status, not exclusion, is at stake.

**Key observations:**

1. **Luo (G3089) vs. kataluo (G2647):** Jesus uses luo (the simple verb "to loosen") in v. 19 for "breaking" individual commandments, and kataluo (the intensified compound "to loosen down completely / demolish") in v. 17 for "destroying" the law wholesale. The two words share the same root (luo), indicating that breaking individual commandments (micro-level) is the practical manifestation of what Jesus denied doing wholesale (macro-level). One who "loosens" even a single commandment participates in the very activity Jesus denied.

2. **John 10:35 parallel:** "The scripture cannot be broken (luthenai)" uses the same verb luo with the sense that Scripture cannot be annulled or set aside. Jesus treats both Scripture and commandments as having binding authority that cannot be "loosened."

3. **"These least commandments":** The demonstrative pronoun "these" (touton) points back to what has just been mentioned -- "the law" of vv. 17-18. The word entole (G1785) is the standard NT word for commandment/precept. The superlative "least" (elachistos, G1646) is significant: if even the LEAST commandment cannot be broken without kingdom-status consequences, the greater commandments are self-evidently even more binding.

4. **Kingdom operability:** Both the commandment-breaker and the commandment-keeper are described as being within "the kingdom of heaven." The consequence of commandment-breaking is rank ("called least"), not exclusion. This presupposes the commandments are operative as the kingdom's standards. A standard that had ceased to apply could not serve as the basis for kingdom-rank determination.

5. **Teaching responsibility:** Jesus addresses not only personal conduct ("break" / "do") but also teaching ("teach men so" / "teach them"). The responsibility extends to how one instructs others regarding the commandments.

**Cross-references:**
- Jas 2:10: "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."
- Jas 2:11-12: James cites the 6th and 7th commandments, then calls the law "the law of liberty" by which believers will be judged.
- Rev 22:14: "Blessed are they that do his commandments."

### Matthew 5:20 -- "For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."

**Context:** Another "For" (gar) statement, providing the ground for the preceding: the standard of righteousness required for kingdom entrance exceeds that of the most publicly observant group in Israel.

**Direct statement:** Jesus demands a righteousness (dikaiosune, G1343) that surpasses (perisseuo, [G4052](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4052/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, "to superabound, exceed, excel") Pharisaic righteousness. Without this exceeding righteousness, kingdom entrance is denied.

**Key observations:**

1. **Pharisaic righteousness:** The Pharisees were the most externally law-observant class in Israel. They tithed even herbs (Mat 23:23), fasted twice weekly (Luk 18:12), and meticulously observed purity rituals (Mat 15:1-2). Yet Jesus characterizes their righteousness as insufficient. Matthew 23:27-28 reveals why: "outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity (anomias)." Their righteousness was external/performative, not internal/heartfelt.

2. **Nature of exceeding righteousness:** The antitheses that follow (vv. 21-48) define what this exceeding righteousness looks like: not merely abstaining from murder but controlling anger (v. 22); not merely abstaining from adultery but controlling lust (v. 28); not merely performing oaths but being entirely truthful (v. 37); not merely retaliating proportionally but responding with grace (v. 39); not merely loving neighbors but loving enemies (v. 44). The standard moves from external compliance to internal transformation.

3. **Connection to new covenant:** This exceeding righteousness aligns with the new covenant promise: "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts" (Jer 31:33). The Spirit enables this internal righteousness: "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Rom 8:4).

4. **Not a different law but a deeper engagement:** The exceeding righteousness is not about keeping a different set of commands but about keeping the same commands at a deeper level. The antitheses demonstrate this: the Decalogue commandments are quoted (vv. 21, 27) and then deepened, not replaced.

**Cross-references:**
- Rom 10:3: "They being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness."
- Php 3:6, 9: Paul had Pharisaic righteousness ("touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless") but counted it loss for "the righteousness which is of God by faith."
- Luk 18:9-14: The Pharisee vs. publican parable -- external righteousness vs. humble dependence on God.
- Mat 23:23: "The weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done."

## The Six Antitheses (Matthew 5:21-48)

### First Antithesis -- Murder (vv. 21-26)

**"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill"** -- Jesus quotes the 6th commandment (Exo 20:13). **"But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment."** Jesus extends the prohibition from the act of murder to the internal disposition (anger) that produces it. This is deepening, not replacement. The original commandment stands; its scope is widened to include the heart-attitude.

### Second Antithesis -- Adultery (vv. 27-30)

**"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery"** -- Jesus quotes the 7th commandment (Exo 20:14). **"But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."** The same pattern as the first antithesis: the commandment stands; its scope is widened to include the heart-attitude (lust) that produces the act.

### Third Antithesis -- Divorce (vv. 31-32)

**"It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement"** -- This references Deuteronomy 24:1-4. **"But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery."** Jesus addresses the Mosaic provision for divorce. In Matthew 19:4-8, Jesus explains that this provision was a concession "because of the hardness of your hearts" but "from the beginning it was not so." Jesus restores the creation standard (Gen 2:24), which the Mosaic provision had relaxed due to human incapacity. This is not overriding Scripture but restoring the original divine intention that preceded the concession.

### Fourth Antithesis -- Oaths (vv. 33-37)

**"Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths"** -- A summary of OT oath-taking teaching (Lev 19:12; Num 30:2; Deu 23:21). **"But I say unto you, Swear not at all... But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay."** Jesus addresses the proliferation of oath-taking and calls for a truthfulness so complete that oaths become unnecessary. The 9th commandment ("Thou shalt not bear false witness") is deepened to demand total honesty in all speech, not merely under oath.

### Fifth Antithesis -- Retaliation (vv. 38-42)

**"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth"** -- The lex talionis (Exo 21:24; Lev 24:20; Deu 19:21). **"But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil."** The lex talionis was a judicial court standard (the context of Deu 19:15-21 is a court proceeding with judges and witnesses), not a personal conduct standard. Leviticus 19:18 ("Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself") was already the personal-conduct standard. Jesus addresses personal conduct: how individuals should respond when wronged. He does not address judicial process. The distinction between judicial penalty (proportional justice administered by courts) and personal response (grace toward wrongdoers) is maintained.

### Sixth Antithesis -- Love for Enemies (vv. 43-48)

**"Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy"** -- The first part quotes Leviticus 19:18. The second part ("and hate thine enemy") does not appear verbatim anywhere in the OT canonical text. This indicates the "heard" tradition appended a scribal addition to the biblical commandment. Jesus corrects the tradition, not the Scripture: **"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you."** The love commandment is extended to its fullest scope -- including enemies -- which is its original divine intention (reflecting the character of the Father who "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good," v. 45).

---

## Patterns Identified

1. **Pattern of deepening, not replacement:** Every antithesis takes an existing commandment and extends it to a deeper or wider application. None revokes an OT commandment. The direction is always toward greater moral stringency, not toward relaxation or replacement. This is consistent with Isaiah 42:21 ("magnify the law and make it honourable") and with the pleroo = "fill full with meaning" reading of Mat 5:17.

2. **Pattern of correcting tradition, not Scripture:** Several antitheses target scribal/oral tradition appended to Scripture rather than Scripture itself. Most clearly, the sixth antithesis exposes "hate thine enemy" as having no OT source. The third antithesis addresses a Mosaic concession, not a divine absolute. The fifth addresses a court provision applied to personal conduct. In each case, Jesus upholds the underlying divine principle while correcting human distortion.

3. **Pattern of internal vs. external:** The righteousness that exceeds the Pharisees' is internal rather than merely external. Murder extends to anger; adultery to lust; oath-keeping to comprehensive truthfulness. This matches the new covenant promise of law written on hearts (Jer 31:33) and the Spirit enabling the law's righteous requirement to be fulfilled in believers (Rom 8:4).

4. **Pattern of kataluo denial + pleroo affirmation:** The programmatic statement (v. 17) denies demolition and affirms filling-full. The antitheses demonstrate what filling-full looks like: taking each commandment and revealing its maximal moral scope. The two words form a complementary pair: not tear down but build up; not dismantle but fill to capacity.

## Connections Between Passages

### Mat 5:17-20 and Romans 3:31
Paul's "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law" is the Pauline parallel to Jesus' "I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil." Both deny the law's abolition; both affirm its continuing validity. Paul's verb histemi ("establish") means to set upright, to make stand firm -- the opposite of kataluo.

### Mat 5:17-20 and Romans 8:4
"That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled (pleroo) in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Paul uses the same word (pleroo) for what the Spirit accomplishes in believers: the law's righteous requirement is fulfilled -- filled full -- in those who walk by the Spirit. This is the new covenant mechanism that enables the "exceeding righteousness" of Mat 5:20.

### Mat 5:17-20 and Galatians 5:14
"All the law is fulfilled (peplērotai, Perfect Passive) in one word...Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." Paul uses pleroo in the perfect tense -- a completed action with continuing results -- for law-fulfillment through love. Love is the means by which the law is filled full (not terminated). This aligns with Romans 13:8-10 where Paul quotes five Decalogue commandments as the content love fulfills.

### Mat 5:17-20 and Isaiah 42:21
Matthew 12:17-21 explicitly identifies Jesus as the Servant of Isaiah 42. Isaiah 42:21 states: "He will magnify the law, and make it honourable." The Hebrew gadal ("magnify") and the antitheses' pattern of deepening are the same activity. What Jesus does in Mat 5:21-48 is the practical demonstration of what Isaiah 42:21 predicted the Servant would do.

### Mat 5:17-20 and Luke 16:16-17
Luke 16:16-17 juxtaposes two statements: "The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached" (v. 16) and "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail" (v. 17). Verse 17 immediately qualifies verse 16: the transition from the law's prophetic/custodial era to the kingdom proclamation era does NOT mean the law ceases. The law's authority endures even as its era-function changes.

## Word Study Insights

### Kataluo (G2647)
The word consistently means to demolish, overthrow, dismantle throughout the NT. Jesus' double denial ("I am not come to katalusai... I am not come to katalusai, but to plerosai") places the strongest possible negation on this word. He does not merely say He will not destroy the law; He warns hearers not even to think it.

### Pleroo (G4137)
The contextual determination favors the "fill full with meaning / magnify" sense over the "complete and terminate" sense. The evidence: (1) the immediate context (vv. 18-19) affirms law permanence; (2) the antitheses demonstrate deepening, not termination; (3) Matthew 3:15 uses the identical form to mean "perform/accomplish"; (4) Romans 8:4, 13:8, and Galatians 5:14 use pleroo for ongoing law-fulfillment by believers; (5) Isaiah 42:21 ("magnify the law") describes the same messianic activity.

### Luo (G3089) vs. Kataluo (G2647)
The simple and compound forms share the root luo but differ in degree. Luo = to loosen a single commandment (v. 19). Kataluo = to loosen down completely, to demolish the entire law (v. 17). Breaking even a "least" commandment participates in the activity Jesus denied at the macro level. John 10:35 ("the scripture cannot be luthenai") confirms that luo in this semantic field means to annul or set aside binding authority.

### Dikaiosune (G1343)
In Matthew's Gospel, dikaiosune appears at critical points: 3:15 (Jesus fulfills all righteousness), 5:6 (hunger and thirst after it), 5:10 (persecuted for its sake), 5:20 (must exceed Pharisees'), 6:1 (do not perform it before men), 6:33 (seek first God's kingdom and His righteousness). The righteousness that exceeds Pharisaic righteousness is not a different category of righteousness but the same moral standard internalized -- heart-level, Spirit-enabled, comprehensive.

---

## Difficult Passages

### "Till all be fulfilled" (Mat 5:18b)
The second temporal clause ("till all be fulfilled," heos an panta genetai) has been read as referring to Christ's death/resurrection, potentially releasing the law's binding force. The text uses ginomai ("come to pass"), not pleroo (the prophetic-fulfillment word). Luke 16:17 contains only the cosmic condition with no second clause, providing a parallel with only the absolute permanence statement. The second clause in Mat 5:18 functions as a reinforcing parallel to the first -- "until the cosmos ends, and until everything has occurred" -- rather than an earlier release valve. The choice of ginomai over pleroo, and the Luke parallel, support the reading that both clauses describe the same eschatological horizon.

### Luke 16:16 -- "The law and the prophets were until John"
This statement is sometimes read as declaring the law's cessation. The immediately following verse (Luk 16:17) states: "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail." The juxtaposition is significant: v. 16 describes a transition in eras (from the law-and-prophets era to the kingdom-preaching era), not a termination of the law's authority. The law's prophetic-custodial role changes at John's preaching; the law's moral authority endures (v. 17).

### Antitheses 3-5 (Divorce, Oaths, Retaliation)
These antitheses appear to set aside Mosaic provisions. However: (1) The divorce provision was a Mosaic concession "because of the hardness of your hearts" (Mat 19:8), not a divine absolute -- Jesus restores the creation standard, not overrides a divine command. (2) The oath-taking laws are not revoked but superseded by a higher standard of total truthfulness -- the underlying principle (do not lie) is deepened. (3) The lex talionis was a judicial standard (Deu 19:15-21); Jesus addresses personal conduct. In each case, the pattern is clarification and deepening, not demolition -- consistent with v. 17's denial of kataluo.
