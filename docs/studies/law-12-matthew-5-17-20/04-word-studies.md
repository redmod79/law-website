| destroy | 1 | 5.0% |
| were dissolved | 1 | 5.0% |
| I destroyed | 1 | 5.0% |

### Semantic Range
The word carries three semantic clusters:

**1. Physical demolition/dismantling (most common):**
- Mat 24:2; Mrk 13:2; Luk 21:6 -- temple stones "thrown down"
- Mat 26:61; 27:40; Mrk 14:58; 15:29 -- "destroy this temple"

**2. Figurative destruction/annulment:**
- Mat 5:17 (2x) -- "destroy the law or the prophets"
- Acts 5:38-39 -- "come to nought" / "overthrow" (God's work)
- Acts 6:14 -- "destroy this place" (customs of Moses)
- Rom 14:20 -- "destroy not the work of God"
- Gal 2:18 -- "things which I destroyed"
- 2 Cor 5:1 -- "dissolved" (earthly tabernacle)

**3. Hospitality/lodging (literal "loosen down" = unpack):**
- Luk 9:12 -- "lodge" (stop for the night)
- Luk 19:7 -- "to be guest"

### Key Observation for Mat 5:17
In Mat 5:17, Jesus uses kataluo twice in the emphatic construction: "Think not (me nomisete) that I am come to katalusai the law or the prophets: I am not come to katalusai, but to plerosai." The word is an aorist active infinitive -- purpose clause. Every other figurative use of kataluo in the NT carries the sense of complete undoing, dismantling, or annulling. Jesus emphatically denies this intention regarding "the law or the prophets."

## [G4137](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4137/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- pleroo (πληρόω) -- "fulfil"

### Lexicon Entry
- **Greek:** πληρόω
- **Transliteration:** pleroo
- **Pronunciation:** play-ro'-o
- **Part of Speech:** verb
- **Root:** from pleres (G4134, "full")
- **Literal meaning:** "to make full, to fill up"
- **BLB Count:** 90 occurrences in the NT

### Definition
To make replete, i.e., (literally) to cram (a net), level up (a hollow), or (figuratively) to furnish (or imbue, diffuse, influence), satisfy, execute (an office), finish (a period or task), verify (or coincide with a prediction), etc.

### Translation Distribution (72 total KJV occurrences)
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| it might be fulfilled | 8 | 11.1% |
| be fulfilled | 6 | 8.3% |
| filled | 4 | 5.6% |
| was fulfilled | 3 | 4.2% |
| to fulfil | 3 | 4.2% |
| is fulfilled | 3 | 4.2% |
| fulfilled | 3 | 4.2% |
| might be fulfilled | 2 | 2.8% |
| complete | 2 | 2.8% |
| (other translations) | 38 | remaining |

### Semantic Range
The word carries four major semantic clusters:

**1. Prophetic fulfillment -- "that it might be fulfilled" (most frequent in Matthew):**
- Mat 1:22; 2:15, 17, 23; 4:14; 8:17; 12:17; 13:35; 21:4; 26:54, 56; 27:9, 35
- This is Matthew's characteristic fulfillment formula (hina/hopos plerothe)
- Meaning: An OT prediction/type has reached its intended realization

**2. Filling up / making full (literal):**
- Mat 13:48 -- net "was full"
- Acts 2:2 -- "filled all the house"
- Jhn 12:3 -- house "was filled with the odour"

**3. Accomplishing / completing (a task, time, or obligation):**
- Luk 7:1 -- "when he had ended all his sayings"
- Acts 7:23, 30 -- "when forty years were expired"
- Acts 12:25 -- "when they had fulfilled their ministry"
- Col 1:25 -- "to fulfil the word of God"
- Col 4:17 -- "fulfil the ministry"

**4. Making full in quality (spiritual fullness):**
- Jhn 15:11; 16:24; 17:13 -- "that your joy might be full"
- Rom 15:13 -- "fill you with all joy and peace"
- Eph 3:19 -- "be filled with all the fulness of God"
- Php 2:2 -- "fulfil ye my joy"

### Critical Question: Which Sense in Mat 5:17?
In Mat 5:17, pleroo is contrasted with kataluo: "I am not come to katalusai but to plerosai." The question is which semantic cluster applies:

**Option A -- Prophetic fulfillment:** Jesus came to bring the law/prophets to their intended realization (as predictions now verified). This is how Matthew uses pleroo most frequently (12+ times with the formula "that it might be fulfilled").

**Option B -- Fill full / make complete:** Jesus came to fill the law full of its intended meaning, to bring out its full depth. This connects to the antitheses that follow (vv. 21-48), where Jesus does not replace OT commands but reveals their deeper intent.

**Option C -- Accomplish/execute:** Jesus came to do/live out the law fully. This connects to Mat 3:15 "to fulfil all righteousness" and Rom 8:4 "the righteousness of the law fulfilled in us."

**Key contextual data:** The immediate context (vv. 18-19) emphasizes the law's continuing validity ("not one jot or tittle shall pass," "whosoever shall break...least commandments"). The antitheses (vv. 21-48) demonstrate not replacement but deepening. This context would support Option B over Option A if "fulfil" meant "bring to completion and then terminate."

## [G3089](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3089/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- luo (λύω) -- "break" / "loosen"

### Lexicon Entry
- **Greek:** λύω
- **Transliteration:** lyo
- **Pronunciation:** loo'-o
- **Part of Speech:** verb (primary verb)
- **Literal meaning:** "to loosen" (literally or figuratively)
- **BLB Count:** 43 occurrences in the NT

### Definition
A primary verb; to "loosen" (literally or figuratively): break (up), destroy, dissolve, (un-)loose, melt, put off.

### Translation Distribution (37 total KJV occurrences)
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| loose | 4 | 10.8% |
| to loose | 3 | 8.1% |
| loosed | 2 | 5.4% |
| be loosed | 2 | 5.4% |
| shall be dissolved | 2 | 5.4% |
| shall break | 1 | 2.7% |
| (other translations) | 23 | remaining |

### Semantic Range
**1. Physical loosening/untying:**
- Mat 21:2; Mrk 1:7; 11:2-4; Luk 3:16; 13:15-16; 19:30-33 -- "loose" the colt/donkey
- Jhn 1:27 -- "unloose" sandals
- Jhn 11:44 -- "Loose him, and let him go" (Lazarus)
- Acts 22:30 -- "loosed him from his bands"

**2. Figurative breaking/annulling/dissolving:**
- Mat 5:19 -- "shall **break** one of these least commandments"
- Jhn 5:18 -- "had **broken** the sabbath" (Jews' accusation)
- Jhn 7:23 -- (implied: circumcision does not "break" sabbath)
- Jhn 10:35 -- "the scripture cannot be **broken**"
- 1 Jhn 3:8 -- "**destroy** the works of the devil"

**3. Release/liberation:**
- Acts 2:24 -- "having **loosed** the pains of death"
- Rev 9:14; 20:3 -- "**Loose** the four angels" / "must be loosed"

### Key Distinction: luo (G3089) vs. kataluo (G2647)
- **luo** = the simple verb "to loosen" -- used in Mat 5:19 for "break" (commandments)
- **kataluo** = the intensified compound "to loosen down completely / demolish" -- used in Mat 5:17 for "destroy" (the law)
- Both words appear in the same pericope (vv. 17 and 19), indicating Jesus uses them with distinct but related senses
- luo in v. 19 = to relax, unbind, or set aside a commandment (even a "least" one)
- kataluo in v. 17 = to completely dismantle or annul the entire law/prophets

### Important: Jhn 10:35 -- "the scripture cannot be broken (luthēnai)"
This verse uses luo with the sense that Scripture cannot be annulled/set aside -- the same word used in Mat 5:19 for "breaking" commandments. Jesus treats both Scripture and commandments as having binding authority that cannot be "loosened."

## [G1343](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1343/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- dikaiosune (δικαιοσύνη) -- "righteousness"

### Lexicon Entry
- **Greek:** δικαιοσύνη
- **Transliteration:** dikaiosyne
- **Pronunciation:** dik-ah-yos-oo'-nay
- **Part of Speech:** feminine noun
- **Root:** from dikaios (G1342, "righteous, just")
- **BLB Count:** 92 occurrences in the NT

### Definition
Equity (of character or act); specially (Christian) justification.

### Translation Distribution (80 total KJV occurrences)
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| righteousness | 42 | 52.5% |
| of righteousness | 18 | 22.5% |
| the righteousness | 9 | 11.2% |
| righteousness' sake | 2 | 2.5% |
| to righteousness | 2 | 2.5% |
| (other) | 7 | remaining |

### Semantic Range in Context of Matthew 5:20
In Mat 5:20, Jesus says the disciples' dikaiosune must "exceed" (perisseuse) that of the scribes and Pharisees. The term appears at several critical points in the Sermon on the Mount:

**In Matthew's Gospel:**
- **Mat 3:15** -- "to fulfil all righteousness" (Jesus at baptism)
- **Mat 5:6** -- "hunger and thirst after righteousness"
- **Mat 5:10** -- "persecuted for righteousness' sake"
- **Mat 5:20** -- "except your righteousness shall exceed..."
- **Mat 6:1** -- "do not your alms [righteousness] before men"
- **Mat 6:33** -- "seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness"
- **Mat 21:32** -- John came "in the way of righteousness"

**In Paul (key contrasts):**
- **Rom 3:21-22** -- "the righteousness of God without the law is manifested"
- **Rom 10:3-4** -- "their own righteousness" vs. "the righteousness of God"
- **Php 3:6, 9** -- "righteousness which is in the law" vs. "the righteousness which is of God by faith"

### Key Observations for Mat 5:20
The word perisseuō (G4052, "exceed, abound") used with dikaiosune creates a comparative: the disciples' righteousness must surpass (not merely match) that of the scribes and Pharisees. This implies the Pharisees had some form of righteousness, but it was insufficient. The context of Mat 23 shows their righteousness was external/performative ("outwardly appear righteous...within full of hypocrisy and iniquity," Mat 23:28).

## [G1345](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1345/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- dikaioma (δικαίωμα) -- "righteousness / ordinance / judgment"

### Lexicon Entry
- **Greek:** δικαίωμα
- **Transliteration:** dikaioma
- **Pronunciation:** dik-ah'-yo-mah
- **Part of Speech:** neuter noun
- **Root:** from dikaioo (G1344, "to justify")
- **BLB Count:** 10 occurrences in the NT

### Definition
An equitable deed; by implication, a statute or decision: judgment, justification, ordinance, righteousness.

### Translation Distribution (10 total KJV occurrences)
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| ordinances | 3 | 30.0% |
| righteousness | 3 | 30.0% |
| judgment | 1 | 10.0% |
| justification | 1 | 10.0% |
| the righteousness | 1 | 10.0% |
| judgments | 1 | 10.0% |

### Key Occurrence: Romans 8:4
> "That the **righteousness** (dikaioma) of the law might be **fulfilled** (pleroo) in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."

This verse directly connects to Mat 5:17 -- the dikaioma (righteous requirement) of the law is pleroo-ed (fulfilled) in those who walk by the Spirit. Dikaioma here refers to the law's righteous standard or requirement, not merely a legal verdict.

### All Occurrences
| Reference | Translation | Context |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Luk 1:6 | ordinances | "walking in all the commandments and ordinances" |
| Rom 1:32 | judgment | "knowing the judgment of God" |
| Rom 2:26 | righteousness | "keep the righteousness of the law" |
| Rom 5:16 | justification | "the free gift is...unto justification" |
| Rom 5:18 | righteousness | "by the righteousness of one" |
| Rom 8:4 | righteousness | "the righteousness of the law fulfilled in us" |

## Additional Word Notes

### [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- entole (ἐντολή) -- "commandment"
Used in Mat 5:19 for "these least commandments" (ton entolon touton ton elachiston). This is the standard NT word for commandment/precept. The demonstrative pronoun "these" (touton) points back to what has just been mentioned -- "the law" of vv. 17-18.

### [G1646](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1646/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- elachistos (ἐλάχιστος) -- "least"
Superlative of elachos (small). Used twice in Mat 5:19: for "least commandments" and "least in the kingdom." The parallelism is striking: whoever "loosens" (luo) the least commandment and teaches others to do so will be called "least" in the kingdom.

### [G4052](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4052/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- perisseuo (περισσεύω) -- "exceed, abound"
Used in Mat 5:20 for the righteousness that must "exceed" (perisseuō) that of the scribes and Pharisees. The word means "to superabound, be in excess, to excel." It is an aorist active subjunctive in a conditional clause (ean me perisseuē), indicating this exceeding is a necessary condition for entering the kingdom.

### [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- nomos (νόμος) -- "law"
Used in Mat 5:17 and 5:18 for "the law" (ton nomon). In the phrase "the law or the prophets" (Mat 5:17), nomos refers to the Torah/Pentateuch as a division of Scripture. In v. 18, "from the law" (apo tou nomou) refers to the same entity. The phrase "the law and the prophets" is a standard Jewish designation for the Hebrew Scriptures (cf. Mat 7:12; 11:13; 22:40; Luk 16:16; Acts 24:14; Rom 3:21).
