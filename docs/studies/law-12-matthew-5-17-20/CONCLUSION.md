# What Does Jesus Mean by "Not Come to Destroy but to Fulfil" in Matthew 5:17-20?

## Question
In Matthew 5:17-20, Jesus declares He came "not to destroy, but to fulfil" the law, states "till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law," warns that breaking "one of these least commandments" affects kingdom status, and demands righteousness "exceeding the scribes and Pharisees." What do these four verses actually say about the continuity, authority, and scope of the law? Specifically: (1) What are the semantic ranges of kataluo and pleroo? (2) What does the permanence statement mean? (3) What are "these least commandments"? (4) How do the six antitheses relate to vv. 17-20? (5) What kind of righteousness exceeds the Pharisees'?

## Summary Answer
Jesus' statement in Matthew 5:17-20 constitutes His most direct recorded address on the question of the law's continuing authority. Kataluo (G2647) consistently means demolish/annul throughout its 17 NT occurrences; Jesus' emphatic double denial ("Think not...I am not come to destroy") explicitly excludes abrogation as His purpose toward the law. Pleroo (G4137), determined by its immediate context (vv. 18-19 affirm permanence), the same-author parallel (Mat 3:15 = perform/accomplish), and the antitheses that follow (deepening, not termination), means to fill full with intended meaning -- to magnify the law (Isa 42:21). The permanence statement ties the law's duration to the duration of the cosmos. The "least commandments" are the commandments of "the law" just mentioned (vv. 17-18), operative as the kingdom's standard. The six antitheses demonstrate what pleroo looks like in practice: each Decalogue or Torah commandment is deepened to heart-level application, never revoked. The exceeding righteousness is internal, Spirit-enabled obedience to the same law the Pharisees kept only externally.

## Key Verses

**Matthew 5:17** -- "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."

**Matthew 5:18** -- "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."

**Matthew 5:19** -- "Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."

**Matthew 5:20** -- "For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."

**Isaiah 42:21** -- "The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable."

**Romans 8:4** -- "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."

**Romans 3:31** -- "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."

**Galatians 5:14** -- "For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."

## Analysis

### 1. Kataluo (G2647): The Semantic Range of "Destroy"

The word kataluo appears 17 times in the NT. In all non-lodging uses, the meaning is consistently demolish, overthrow, tear down, bring to nothing. The physical uses describe temple demolition (Mat 24:2; 26:61; 27:40; Mrk 13:2; 14:58; 15:29; Luk 21:6). The figurative uses describe undoing or annulling (Acts 5:38-39; 6:14; Rom 14:20; 2 Cor 5:1; Gal 2:18). None of the 17 uses means "bring to fulfillment," "complete," or "supersede." The compound kata + luo (loosen down completely) intensifies the simple verb luo used in v. 19 for breaking individual commandments.

Jesus' double denial -- "Think not (me nomisete) that I am come to katalusai... I am not come to katalusai" -- uses the strongest available word for demolition/annulment and denies it emphatically. Acts 6:14 confirms this sense: the same word appears as a false charge against Stephen ("Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us"), showing the early church understood kataluo as abolish/annul.

### 2. Pleroo (G4137): The Semantic Range of "Fulfil"

Pleroo appears 90 times in the NT with four semantic clusters: (a) prophetic fulfillment (Matthew's formula, 12+ times); (b) filling up / making full literally; (c) accomplishing a task; (d) making full in quality. The contextual determination of which sense applies in Mat 5:17 relies on:

- **Immediate context (vv. 18-19):** Affirms the law's continuing validity ("not one jot or tittle shall pass"; "whosoever shall break...least commandments"). If pleroo meant "complete and terminate," v. 18 would contradict v. 17 within the same sentence.
- **Same-author parallel (Mat 3:15):** The identical Greek form (plerosai, Aorist Active Infinitive) means "to fulfil all righteousness" -- to perform/accomplish what God's righteousness requires, not to terminate it. Same author, three chapters apart.
- **Antitheses (vv. 21-48):** Demonstrate deepening, not replacement. Each commandment is extended to heart-level application.
- **NT usage by Paul:** Romans 8:4 ("the righteousness of the law fulfilled in us"), Romans 13:8-10 (love fulfills the law by keeping the Decalogue commands), Galatians 5:14 ("all the law is fulfilled in one word...love"). All describe ongoing fulfillment through love and Spirit-walking, not termination.
- **Isaiah 42:21 connection:** Matthew 12:17-21 identifies Jesus as the Servant of Isaiah 42:1-4. Isaiah 42:21 states: "He will magnify the law, and make it honourable." The Servant magnifies the law. The antitheses demonstrate this magnification.

The evidence favors the reading that pleroo means to fill the law with its intended fullness and deepest meaning.

### 3. The Permanence Statement (v. 18)

Jesus ties the law's endurance to the cosmos: "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law." The ou me construction (double negative) is the strongest form of negation in Greek, expressing emphatic impossibility. Luke 16:17 is the parallel: "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."

The second temporal clause ("till all be fulfilled," heos an panta genetai) uses ginomai ("come to pass"), not pleroo (the prophetic-fulfillment word). This lexical choice is significant. Luke's parallel has only the cosmic condition. The second clause functions as reinforcement: both cosmic permanence and the completion of all things must occur before the law changes in any detail.

### 4. "These Least Commandments" (v. 19)

The demonstrative pronoun "these" (touton) points back to what has just been mentioned -- "the law" of vv. 17-18. Entole (G1785) is the standard NT word for commandment. The superlative "least" (elachistos) is significant: if even the LEAST commandment cannot be broken without kingdom-status consequences, the greater commandments are more binding still.

Both the commandment-breaker and the commandment-keeper are described as being within "the kingdom of heaven." The consequence of commandment-breaking is rank ("called least"), not exclusion. This presupposes the commandments are operative as the kingdom's standards.

Luo (G3089) in v. 19 for "breaking" individual commandments shares the same root as kataluo (G2647) in v. 17 for "destroying" the law wholesale. Breaking individual commandments is the micro-level version of what Jesus denied doing at the macro level.

### 5. The Six Antitheses (vv. 21-48): Magnification, Not Replacement

The antitheses demonstrate what pleroo looks like in practice:

**Antitheses 1-2 (Murder, Adultery):** Quote Decalogue commandments verbatim (Exo 20:13, 14) and extend them to heart-level motivation (anger, lust). The original commandments stand; their scope is widened.

**Antithesis 3 (Divorce):** Addresses a Mosaic concession that Jesus identifies as given "because of the hardness of your hearts" (Mat 19:8) -- not a divine absolute. Jesus restores the creation standard (Gen 2:24).

**Antithesis 4 (Oaths):** Deepens the truthfulness requirement from formal oath-keeping to comprehensive honesty in all speech.

**Antithesis 5 (Retaliation):** The lex talionis was a judicial court standard (Deu 19:15-21 context), not a personal-conduct standard. Leviticus 19:18 ("love thy neighbour") was already the personal standard. Jesus addresses personal conduct.

**Antithesis 6 (Love for Enemies):** The phrase "and hate thine enemy" does not appear in the OT canonical text. Jesus corrects a scribal addition, extending love to its fullest scope.

In every antithesis, the direction is toward greater moral stringency, not toward relaxation or replacement. This is the magnification Isaiah 42:21 predicted.

### 6. Righteousness Exceeding the Pharisees' (v. 20)

The Pharisees' righteousness was external and performative: "outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity" (Mat 23:28). The exceeding righteousness is internal transformation -- the same commandments kept at heart-level. This aligns with the new covenant promise: "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts" (Jer 31:33); "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Rom 8:4).

## Word Studies

### Kataluo (G2647) -- 17 NT occurrences
Every non-lodging use means demolish/overthrow/annul. Physical: temple stones thrown down (Mat 24:2; Mrk 13:2; Luk 21:6), temple destruction charge (Mat 26:61; 27:40; Mrk 14:58; 15:29). Figurative: God's work cannot be overthrown (Acts 5:38-39); false charge of destroying Moses' customs (Acts 6:14); do not destroy God's work (Rom 14:20); earthly tabernacle dissolved (2 Cor 5:1); things Paul destroyed in conversion (Gal 2:18). Jesus chose this word -- the strongest available term for demolition -- and denied it twice.

### Pleroo (G4137) -- 90 NT occurrences
Prophetic fulfillment (Mat 1:22; 2:15, 17, 23; 4:14; etc.); filling up literally (Mat 13:48; Acts 2:2); accomplishing tasks (Acts 12:25; Col 1:25; 4:17); making full in quality (Jhn 15:11; 16:24; Eph 3:19). Context determines the sense: Mat 5:17's immediate context (permanence in v. 18, commandment-operability in v. 19) and the antitheses (deepening, not termination) favor "fill full with meaning." The same-author Mat 3:15 parallel confirms.

### Luo (G3089) -- 43 NT occurrences
Physical loosening/untying (sandals, animals, Lazarus); figurative breaking/annulling (Mat 5:19 commandments; Jhn 5:18 sabbath accusation; Jhn 10:35 scripture cannot be broken); release/liberation (Acts 2:24; Rev 20:3). The connection to kataluo: luo is the simple verb; kataluo is the intensified compound. Breaking commandments individually (luo, v. 19) is the practical form of what Jesus denied doing wholesale (kataluo, v. 17).

### Dikaiosune (G1343) -- 92 NT occurrences
In Matthew: fulfilling all righteousness (3:15), hungering for it (5:6), persecuted for its sake (5:10), exceeding Pharisees' (5:20), performing it before God not men (6:1), seeking it first (6:33). The exceeding righteousness is not a different category but the same moral standard internalized through Spirit-empowered heart-transformation.

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Position | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Kataluo (G2647) appears 17 times in the NT. Of all non-lodging uses, the word consistently means demolish, overthrow, tear down, bring to nothing. None of the 17 uses means "bring to fulfillment," "complete," or "supersede." | Mat 5:17 (x2); 24:2; 26:61; 27:40; Mrk 13:2; 14:58; 15:29; Lk 21:6; Acts 5:38-39; 6:14; Rom 14:20; 2 Cor 5:1; Gal 2:18 | Neutral | E309 |
| E2 | Pleroo (G4137) appears 90 times in the NT and is translated "fulfil/fulfilled" (~50x), "fill/filled" (~25x), "complete/accomplish" (~10x). It is never used to mean "abolish," "terminate," or "supersede." | Mat 5:17; 3:15; Rom 13:8-10; Gal 5:14; Rom 8:4 | Neutral | E310 |
| E3 | Jesus said at His baptism: "Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil (plerosai, Aor Act Inf of pleroo G4137) all righteousness." The identical aorist active infinitive form appears in Mat 3:15 and Mat 5:17, written by the same author within three chapters. In 3:15 the meaning is to perform/accomplish what God's righteousness requires. | Mat 3:15 | Neutral | E311 |
| E4 | Acts 6:14 uses kataluo (katalusei) as the accusation against Stephen: "This Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy (katalusei) this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us." The same word Jesus denied in Mat 5:17 appears as a false charge. | Acts 6:14 | Neutral | E312 |
| E5 | Matthew 12:17-21 quotes Isaiah 42:1-4 and explicitly applies it to Jesus: "That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Behold my servant, whom I have chosen..." The Servant of Isa 42:1-4 (who magnifies the law in v.21) is identified by Matthew as Jesus. | Mat 12:17-21 | Neutral | E313 |
| E6 | In Mat 5:18, the two "until" conditions both use heos an + aorist subjunctive: (1) heos an parelthe ("till heaven and earth pass") using parerchomai (G3928); (2) heos an panta genetai ("till all come to pass") using ginomai (G1096), not pleroo. The second clause uses the general "come to pass" verb, not the prophetic-fulfillment word. | Mat 5:18 | Neutral | E314 |
| E7 | In Mat 5:19, luo (G3089, simplex verb) is used for "breaking" individual commandments. In Mat 5:17, kataluo (G2647, compound: kata- + luo) is used for "demolishing" the law wholesale. The simplex (v.19) and compound (v.17) share the same root. | Mat 5:17, 19 | Neutral | E315 |
| E8 | In Mat 5:19, BOTH the commandment-breaker AND the commandment-keeper are described as being within "the kingdom of heaven." The consequence of commandment-breaking is rank ("called least"), not exclusion. Both outcomes presuppose the commandments are operative as the kingdom's standards. | Mat 5:19 | Continues | E316 |
| E9 | Mat 5:21 quotes Exo 20:13 (6th commandment) and Mat 5:27 quotes Exo 20:14 (7th commandment). The first two antitheses take their basis explicitly from the Decalogue. | Mat 5:21, 27; Exo 20:13-14 | Neutral | E317 |
| E10 | "For all the law is fulfilled (peplērotai, G4137) in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." Galatians 5:14 uses pleroo for ongoing law-fulfillment through love -- a present-perfect passive describing love as the means by which the law is filled full, not terminated. | Gal 5:14 | Continues | E318 |
| E11 | The sixth antithesis states: "Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy." The phrase "and hate thine enemy" does not appear verbatim anywhere in the OT canonical text, indicating this portion reflects scribal tradition, not Scripture. | Mat 5:43 | Neutral | E319 |
| E12 | Jesus states: "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law." | Mat 5:17-18 | Continues | E021 |
| E13 | Jesus states: "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail." | Luk 16:17 | Continues | E022 |
| E14 | "Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven." | Mat 5:19 | Continues | E043 |
| E15 | "The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable." | Isa 42:21 | Continues | E044 |
| E16 | Paul states: "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." Context identifies the law by the 10th commandment (Rom 7:7). | Rom 7:12; 7:7 | Continues | E010 |
| E17 | "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." | Rom 3:31 | Continues | E025 |
| E18 | "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." | Rom 8:4 | Continues | E026 |
| E19 | Paul quotes five Decalogue commandments as the content love fulfills: adultery, kill, steal, false witness, covet. "Love is the fulfilling of the law." | Rom 13:8-10 | Continues | E028 |
| E20 | "Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein...this man shall be blessed." James cites 6th and 7th commandments (2:11). | Jas 1:25; 2:10-12 | Continues | E029 |

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable | Position | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The verb kataluo (G2647), as Jesus used it in Mat 5:17, means to demolish or overthrow the law entirely -- since every NT use of kataluo in an equivalent structural context means exactly this. Jesus' double denial therefore explicitly excludes demolition/abrogation as His purpose toward the law. | E1 (E309), E12 (E021) | Every instance of kataluo in figurative use means annul/overthrow. The double denial with the strongest form of negation (me nomisete + ouk...alla) leaves no alternative reading. A scholar from either position would agree Jesus denied kataluo toward the law. | Continues | N060 |
| N2 | The identical Greek form plerosai (Aorist Active Infinitive of pleroo) appears in Mat 3:15 and Mat 5:17, written by the same author within three chapters. In Mat 3:15, the form means to accomplish what God's righteousness requires -- not to terminate it. The same author uses the same form with the same semantic force in both passages. | E2 (E310), E3 (E311) | Same author, same form, three chapters. Both scholars would agree the same form by the same author favors the same sense. | Neutral | N061 |
| N3 | Isaiah 42:21 ("he will magnify the law, and make it honourable") is applied to Jesus by Matthew (Mat 12:17-21). The Servant who magnifies and honors the law IS Jesus. Jesus' pleroo-action in Mat 5:17 and the Servant's "magnify" (gadal) in Isa 42:21 describe the same messianic activity toward the same law. | E5 (E313), E15 (E044) | Matthew explicitly connects the Isaianic Servant to Jesus. The Servant magnifies the law; Jesus fills the law full. Both sides must acknowledge Matthew makes this identification. | Continues | N062 |
| N4 | Mat 5:19's consequence (kingdom rank tied to commandment-breaking/keeping) logically presupposes that the commandments remain operative as the standard for kingdom citizens. A standard that had ceased to apply could not serve as the basis for kingdom-rank determination. | E14 (E043), E8 (E316) | If the commandments are inoperative, ranking by compliance is nonsensical. Any reader would agree operative standards are presupposed. | Continues | N063 |
| N5 | The first two antitheses (Mat 5:21-22; 5:27-30) each quote a Decalogue commandment (Exo 20:13 murder; Exo 20:14 adultery) and extend it to heart-level motivation (anger; lust), producing a MORE restrictive standard. The direction of every deepening antithesis is toward greater moral stringency, not toward relaxation or replacement. | E9 (E317), E8 (E316), E14 (E043) | The antitheses add prohibition (anger, lust) to existing commandments. Adding prohibition = greater stringency. Any reader can observe that deeper ≠ weaker. | Continues | N064 |

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Position | Criteria | Master ID |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that pleroo in Mat 5:17 means Jesus filled the law with its intended fullness and deepest meaning -- demonstrated by the six antitheses extending commandments to heart-level -- rather than completing them in a way that terminated their binding force. | I-A | E309 (kataluo = demolish in all 17 uses); E310 (pleroo never = abolish); N061 (Mat 3:15 same form = perform); N062 (Isa 42:21 Servant magnifies law = Jesus); N064 (antitheses deepen, not replace); E026/Rom 8:4 (righteousness of law fulfilled in Spirit-walkers); E318/Gal 5:14 (law fulfilled through love, present-perfect passive). | Systematizes multiple E/N items into a comprehensive claim about pleroo's meaning. All components are text-derived. Only criterion #5 applies. | Continues | #5 | I074 |
| I2 | The Bible teaches that pleroo in Mat 5:17 means Jesus brought the law to its completion by fulfilling its prophetic types and redemptive purpose, so that its binding force was fulfilled-and-terminated in His person and work. | I-B | FOR: Matthew's prophetic-fulfillment usage of pleroo (16 times); Luk 24:44 links fulfillment to Jesus' person. AGAINST: Mat 5:18 (same verse) states not one jot shall pass (E021); Mat 5:19 assumes commandments operative (E043/N063); N061 (Mat 3:15 same form = performing righteousness); N062 (Servant magnifies law); E026/Rom 8:4 and E318/Gal 5:14 (present-tense pleroo fulfillment by Spirit-walkers and love). | FOR requires the prophetic-fulfillment sense to include termination of the prophesied entity; AGAINST includes the same-verse permanence statement and same-author parallels showing pleroo as ongoing.

| I3 | The Bible teaches that "till all be fulfilled" (heos an panta genetai) in Mat 5:18 was accomplished at the cross or resurrection, releasing the law's binding force. | I-B | FOR: John 19:30 ("It is finished"); Luk 24:44 (fulfillment linked to first advent). AGAINST: E314 (ginomai ≠ pleroo -- general "come to pass" verb, not prophetic-fulfillment word); E022/Luk 16:17 (parallel permanence statement has only the cosmic condition). | FOR requires interpreting ginomai as equivalent to pleroo (choosing between meanings -- criterion #2). AGAINST: Luke's parallel governs by SIS (same topic, clearer because it has only one condition). | Both (resolved Moderate toward eschatological scope / Continues) | #2, #4b | I076 |
| I4 | The Bible teaches that the six antitheses (Mat 5:21-48) demonstrate what Jesus' "fulfilling" the law looks like: each antithesis deepens or extends an OT commandment to its maximal moral scope (Isa 42:21's "magnify the law"), confirming that pleroo = magnification/deepening. | I-A | E309-E310 (kataluo/pleroo semantic data); N062 (Isa 42:21 Servant = Jesus); N064 (antitheses deepen Decalogue to heart-level); E317 (first two antitheses cite Decalogue); E043 (commandment-operability). All components text-derived. | Systematizes the antithesis pattern with the word study data and the Isaianic prophecy. Only criterion #5. | Continues | #5 | I077 |
| I5 | The Bible teaches that Mat 5:17-20's denial of kataluo and affirmation of pleroo, combined with the permanence statement (v.18) and commandment-operative statement (v.19), constitute the clearest direct address by Jesus of the question of whether the moral law continues -- and the recorded answer is that it does. | I-A | E021 (Mat 5:17-18 permanence); E043 (commandment-operability); E316 (kingdom rank presupposes commandments operative); N060 (kataluo double denial = exclusion of abrogation); N063 (commandment consequences presuppose operative standards); E025/Rom 3:31 (Paul's parallel). All text-derived. | Systematizes four verses' combined force into a directional claim. Only criterion #5. | Continues | #5 | I078 |
| I6 | The Bible teaches that the antithesis formula "Ye have heard that it was said... but I say unto you" corrects oral tradition, not the written OT law. The "Ye have heard" in several antitheses targets traditional interpretations -- demonstrated by Mat 5:43's "hate thine enemy" (E319) which has no OT source. | I-A | E021 (kataluo denial); E319 ("hate thine enemy" not in OT); N064 (antitheses deepen, not replace). All text-derived. | Systematizes the observation that Jesus corrects tradition appended to Scripture. Only criterion #5. | Continues | #5 | I079 |
| I7 | The Bible teaches that "the law and the prophets were until John" (Luk 16:16) means the entire law ceased with John -- including the moral law. | I-D | Requires overriding E022/Luk 16:17 (the immediately-following verse says "one tittle of the law cannot fail"), E021/Mat 5:17-18 ("not one tittle shall pass from the law"), and E025/Rom 3:31 ("we establish the law"). The I-D position adds the concept "ceased" to a verse whose immediate next sentence explicitly denies cessation. | Adds a concept ("ceased") that the text does not contain and that the text's own next verse explicitly contradicts. | Abolished | #1, #4b | I080 |
| I8 | The Bible teaches that the antitheses 3-5 (divorce, oaths, retaliation) demonstrate that Jesus overrides even Mosaic law, showing that "fulfil" includes terminating some laws' force. | I-B | FOR: Mat 5:31-32 (divorce) appears stricter than Deu 24:1-4; Mat 5:38-42 (lex talionis) appears to set aside "eye for eye." AGAINST: E021 (kataluo denial in the same discourse); Mat 19:4-8 (Plain, same author) says Deu 24:1-4 was a Mosaic concession "because of hardness of hearts" -- Jesus restores creation standard; lex talionis was a judicial standard (Deu 19:15-21), not a personal-conduct standard (Lev 19:18 was the personal standard). | FOR requires identifying concessions and judicial standards as divine absolutes. AGAINST shows the text itself classifies them differently. | Both (resolved Moderate toward clarification/restoration / Continues) | #2, #5 | I081 |

### I-B Resolutions

#### I-B Resolution: I2 (I075) -- Meaning of pleroo in Mat 5:17

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (terminate-and-complete): Matthew's prophetic-fulfillment formula (pleroo 12+ times = prophetic realization); Luk 24:44 (fulfillment linked to Jesus' person).
- AGAINST (fill-full-with-meaning): E021/Mat 5:17-18 (permanence statement in same verse); E043/Mat 5:19 (commandments operative); N061/Mat 3:15 (same form = perform righteousness); N062/Isa 42:21 (Servant magnifies law = Jesus); E026/Rom 8:4 (law's righteousness fulfilled in Spirit-walkers); E318/Gal 5:14 (law fulfilled through love, ongoing).

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E021 (Mat 5:17-18) | Plain | Direct statement by Jesus using the words "not destroy...fulfil...not pass from the law." Directly addresses the topic. |
| E043 (Mat 5:19) | Plain | Direct commandment-operability statement in immediate context. |
| N061 (Mat 3:15) | Plain | Same form, same author, three chapters apart. Observable lexical parallel. |
| N062 (Isa 42:21) | Plain | Explicit Matthean identification of Jesus as the Servant who magnifies the law. |
| E026 (Rom 8:4) | Plain | Uses pleroo for ongoing law-fulfillment in believers. |
| E318 (Gal 5:14) | Plain | Uses pleroo in present-perfect passive for love fulfilling the law. |
| Matthew's formula | Contextually Clear | Prophetic fulfillment formula uses pleroo, but the objects are prophecies/types, not moral commands. Requires assuming law = prophecy. |
| Luk 24:44 | Contextually Clear | Links fulfillment to "things concerning me" in the law -- Messianic prophecies, not moral commands per se. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
AGAINST has six Plain items. FOR has two Contextually Clear items. The FOR items concern pleroo applied to prophecies and types; they do not directly address pleroo applied to moral commands. The AGAINST items directly address the law in the context of moral commandments.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements (Mat 5:17-18 permanence, Mat 5:19 commandment-operability, same-author parallel in Mat 3:15, Isa 42:21 magnification, Rom 8:4 and Gal 5:14 ongoing fulfillment) determine the reading of the Contextually Clear items (Matthew's formula, Luk 24:44). The prophetic-fulfillment formula applies to prophecies; the law-fulfillment applies to moral commands. Jesus fulfilled prophecies about Himself AND filled the moral law with its deepest meaning. Both senses can coexist within the same verse.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
Six Plain items on one side; two Contextually Clear items on the other. The fill-full-with-meaning reading accounts for pleroo's prophetic-fulfillment usage (prophecies were fulfilled) while also explaining the immediate context (moral law continues). The terminate reading cannot account for the permanence statement in the same verse.

#### I-B Resolution: I3 (I076) -- "Till all be fulfilled" timing

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (cross/resurrection): Jhn 19:30 ("It is finished"); Luk 24:44 (fulfillment at first advent).
- AGAINST (eschatological): E314 (ginomai ≠ pleroo -- different word); E022/Luk 16:17 (parallel has only cosmic condition).

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E314 (ginomai choice) | Plain | Observable lexical fact: Jesus chose ginomai, not pleroo. |
| E022/Luk 16:17 | Plain | Luke's parallel has only the cosmic condition. Same topic, same speaker. |
| Jhn 19:30 | Ambiguous | "It is finished" (tetelestai from teleo, not pleroo) refers to Jesus' suffering/work, not directly to Mat 5:18's "all." |
| Luk 24:44 | Contextually Clear | Links "fulfilled" to Messianic prophecies in the law, not to the law's moral commands ceasing. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
AGAINST has two Plain items. FOR has one Ambiguous and one Contextually Clear.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
Luke 16:17 (same speaker, same topic, Plain clarity) governs the reading of the second clause in Mat 5:18. Luke's version has only the cosmic condition. This identifies the scope of "till all be fulfilled" as the same eschatological horizon.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate**
Two Plain items against one Contextually Clear and one Ambiguous. The eschatological reading accounts for both the lexical choice (ginomai) and the Lucan parallel.

#### I-B Resolution: I8 (I081) -- Antitheses 3-5 override Mosaic law?

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (override): Mat 5:31-32 appears stricter than Deu 24:1-4; Mat 5:38-42 appears to set aside "eye for eye."
- AGAINST (clarification/restoration): E021 (kataluo denial in same discourse); Mat 19:4-8 (same author says Deu 24:1-4 was concession "because of hardness of hearts"); lex talionis was judicial (Deu 19:15-21).

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E021/Mat 5:17 | Plain | Kataluo denial in the same discourse. If Jesus were abolishing provisions, He would contradict His own preamble. |
| Mat 19:4-8 | Plain | Same author. Jesus explicitly classifies Deu 24:1-4 as a concession, not a divine absolute. He restores the creation standard. |
| Mat 5:31-32 | Ambiguous | Appears to change the divorce law, but Mat 19 explains the basis. |
| Mat 5:38-42 | Ambiguous | Appears to set aside lex talionis, but Deu 19:15-21 context is judicial. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
AGAINST has two Plain items. FOR has two Ambiguous items.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
Mat 19:4-8 (same author, Plain) determines the reading of Mat 5:31-32 (Ambiguous): Jesus restores creation standard, not overrides divine law. The lex talionis was a judicial standard; Jesus addresses personal conduct.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate**
Two Plain items govern two Ambiguous items. The clarification/restoration reading is consistent with Jesus' own explanation in Mat 19.

### 4. Verification Phase

**Step A (E-items):** Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases verse text. Semantic range data (E1, E2) are observable lexical facts. The positional classifications follow from vocabulary scans and validation gates.

**Step A2 (E-item positional classification):** E8 (Mat 5:19 kingdom operability) classified Continues because commandment-operative standards presuppose the commandments remain in force (V1: YES). E10 (Gal 5:14 pleroo for ongoing fulfillment) classified Continues because present-perfect passive describing love filling the law full = continuation vocabulary. E12-E21 are existing master items whose classifications have been verified in prior studies.

**Step B (N-items):** N1 (kataluo denial) follows unavoidably from the semantic range data + the double denial. N2 (same plerosai form) is an observable parallel. N3 (Isa 42:21 = Jesus) follows from Matthew's explicit identification. N4 (operative standards) is a logical entailment. N5 (antithesis direction) is observable.

**Step C-D (I-items):** I1 (I-A): all components in E/N tables; only systematizes (criterion #5). I2 (I-B): E/N items on both sides; resolved. I3 (I-B): E/N items on both sides; resolved. I4 (I-A): all text-derived; criterion #5 only. I5 (I-A): all text-derived; criterion #5 only. I6 (I-A): all text-derived; criterion #5 only. I7 (I-D): requires overriding E022 and E021. I8 (I-B): E/N items on both sides; resolved.

**Step E (Consistency checks):** I-A items require only #5 -- confirmed. I-B items have E/N support on both sides -- confirmed. I-D item (I7) overrides E022 -- confirmed.

### 6. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

**What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):**

- Jesus explicitly denied that He came to kataluo (demolish/annul) the law or the prophets (Mat 5:17). Kataluo consistently means demolish/overthrow in all 17 NT uses.
- Jesus stated that until heaven and earth pass, not one jot or tittle shall pass from the law (Mat 5:18). This is reinforced by Luke 16:17.
- Jesus established that both breaking and keeping the commandments have kingdom-status consequences, presupposing the commandments remain operative (Mat 5:19).
- The first two antitheses quote Decalogue commandments (Exo 20:13, 14) and extend them to heart-level application, producing a more restrictive standard (Mat 5:21-22, 27-28).
- Isaiah 42:21 predicted the Servant would magnify the law. Matthew identifies Jesus as this Servant (Mat 12:17-21). The antitheses demonstrate this magnification.
- The identical plerosai form in Mat 3:15 (same author, three chapters away) means to perform/accomplish what righteousness requires, not to terminate it.
- Paul uses pleroo for ongoing law-fulfillment through love (Rom 13:8-10; Gal 5:14) and through the Spirit (Rom 8:4). These are present-tense or present-perfect descriptions, not termination events.
- Paul states "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law" (Rom 3:31).
- The sixth antithesis's "hate thine enemy" has no OT source, indicating Jesus corrects scribal tradition appended to Scripture (Mat 5:43).

**What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):**

- Neither side can claim that Mat 5:17 resolves the law question with absolute finality apart from the rest of Scripture. The passage is one of many data points.
- Neither side can claim that pleroo in Mat 5:17 unambiguously means ONLY one of its semantic options (prophetic fulfillment OR filling full) to the exclusion of all others. The word has a range; context determines the dominant sense.
- Neither side can claim that "till all be fulfilled" (Mat 5:18b) clearly refers to the cross, the resurrection, the second coming, or any specific event. The ginomai verb is general and the Luke parallel omits the clause.
- It cannot be said that the antitheses replace OT commands. It also cannot be said that the antitheses address every aspect of the law equally -- some address Decalogue commandments, others address civil provisions, others address traditions.
- It cannot be said from this passage alone whether "the law or the prophets" includes every specific regulation or refers primarily to the moral principles of the Torah and prophetic writings. The scope requires other passages to determine.

## Conclusion

Matthew 5:17-20 contains Jesus' programmatic statement on His relationship to the law. The lexical data for kataluo (G2647) shows every figurative NT use means demolish, annul, or overthrow. Jesus' emphatic double denial ("Think not...I am not come to destroy") uses this word and excludes abrogation as His purpose. The lexical data for pleroo (G4137) shows the word means to fill full, make replete, accomplish, or verify, and is never used to mean abolish or terminate. The same-author use of the identical form in Mat 3:15 means to perform what righteousness requires. The immediate context -- vv. 18-19 affirming the law's permanence and commandment-operability -- determines that pleroo in v. 17 refers to filling the law with its deepest meaning.

The permanence statement (v. 18) ties the law's duration to the cosmos using the strongest Greek negation (ou me). The commandment-operability statement (v. 19) presupposes the commandments remain the kingdom's standard. The demand for exceeding righteousness (v. 20) calls for internal, heart-level obedience to the same law the Pharisees kept only externally. The six antitheses (vv. 21-48) demonstrate what this filling-full looks like: each commandment is deepened, not replaced.

Across this study's 21 explicit statements, 14 are classified Continues and 0 Abolished; the 7 Neutral items are lexical/grammatical observations both sides accept. All 5 necessary implications are classified as Continues (4) or Neutral (1). Of 8 inferences, the 4 I-A items are all Continues, the 3 I-B items are all resolved toward Continues (1 Strong, 2 Moderate), and the single I-D Abolished item (I080: "law and prophets until John" = cessation) requires overriding the immediately-following verse (Luk 16:17) that explicitly denies cessation.

No Abolished-direction evidence exists at the E or N tier from this passage. The Abolished position's claims about Mat 5:17-20 are all at the inference level and each requires adding concepts the text does not contain or overriding what the text explicitly states.
