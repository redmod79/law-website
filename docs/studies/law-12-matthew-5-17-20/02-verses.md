### Matthew 5:21-48 (The Six Antitheses)

**First Antithesis -- Murder (vv. 21-26):**
> **5:21** Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
> **5:22** But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
> **5:23** Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;
> **5:24** Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
> **5:25** Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
> **5:26** Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.

**Second Antithesis -- Adultery (vv. 27-30):**
> **5:27** Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
> **5:28** But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
> **5:29** And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast [it] from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be cast into hell.
> **5:30** And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast [it] from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be cast into hell.

**Third Antithesis -- Divorce (vv. 31-32):**
> **5:31** It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
> **5:32** But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.

**Fourth Antithesis -- Oaths (vv. 33-37):**
> **5:33** Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
> **5:34** But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:
> **5:35** Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.
> **5:36** Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.
> **5:37** But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.

**Fifth Antithesis -- Retaliation (vv. 38-42):**
> **5:38** Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
> **5:39** But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
> **5:40** And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have [thy] cloke also.
> **5:41** And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
> **5:42** Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.

**Sixth Antithesis -- Love for Enemies (vv. 43-48):**
> **5:43** Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
> **5:44** But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
> **5:45** That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
> **5:46** For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?
> **5:47** And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more [than others]? do not even the publicans so?
