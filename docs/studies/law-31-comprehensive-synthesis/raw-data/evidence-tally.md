## Key Observations

### E-tier (Explicit Statements): 513 total
- **Continues: 146** — Statements directly quoting or paraphrasing verses that use law-continuation vocabulary applied to the moral law/Decalogue, or that distinguish between categories of law
- **Abolished: 0** — No explicit statement in the database directly states the moral law (Decalogue) was abolished
- **Neutral: 367** — Factual textual observations both sides accept, plus ceremonial/civil cessation items

### N-tier (Necessary Implications): 145 total
- **Continues: 73** — Unavoidable logical entailments from E-items that support moral law continuation
- **Abolished: 0** — No necessary implication in the database supports moral law abolition
- **Neutral: 72** — Factual patterns and observations that follow from E-items without positional direction

### I-tier (Inferences): 152 total
- **I-A (Evidence-Extending): 66** — 63 Continues, 0 Abolished, 3 Neutral
- **I-B (Competing-Evidence): 47** — 18 Continues, 22 Abolished, 7 Neutral
- **I-C (Compatible External): 5** — 1 Continues, 1 Abolished, 3 Neutral
- **I-D (Counter-Evidence External): 34** — 0 Continues, 34 Abolished, 0 Neutral

### Distribution Pattern
- All Abolished-direction items are at inference tier (I-B or I-D)
- The Continues position has E-tier, N-tier, I-A, I-B, and I-C support
- The Abolished position has only I-B and I-D support (plus 1 I-C)
- 34 of 57 Abolished items (60%) are I-D (counter-evidence external — requiring override of E/N statements)
