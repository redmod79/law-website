## Key Passage Cross-References

### Col 2:14
- Analyzed in: law-04, law-05, law-07, law-08, law-20, law-21, law-26, law-29
- Key finding: cheirographon tois dogmasin ("handwriting of ordinances") uses vocabulary (dogma, cheirographon) never applied to the Decalogue
- The word cheirographon means "hand-written" — contrasts with the Decalogue written by God's finger
- Classified as E054 (Continues) because the text itself identifies what was nailed

### Mat 5:17
- Analyzed in: law-09, law-10, law-12, law-14, law-29, law-30
- Key finding: Jesus explicitly denies coming to destroy (kataluo) the law; pleroo in context means to fill up/magnify, not terminate
- The kataluo/pleroo contrast and the continuation in vv.18-19 anchor the Continues position at E-tier
- Classified as E021 (Continues)

### Rom 3:31
- Analyzed in: law-08, law-09, law-10, law-16, law-30
- Key finding: Paul uses katargeo ("make void") with me genoito (strongest negation) + histemi ("establish")
- This is the same verb (katargeo) Paul uses in Eph 2:15 for abolishing ordinances — he denies it applies to "the law"
- Classified as E025 (Continues)

### Heb 10:16
- Analyzed in: law-09, law-10, law-11, law-18
- Key finding: The possessive "my laws" (nomous mou) identifies God's pre-existing laws; the same passage removes sacrifices (vv.1-9) and writes laws on hearts (v.16)
- Classified as E306 (Continues)

### Rom 10:4
- Analyzed in: law-16, law-30
- Key finding: Telos has two senses (goal/purpose vs. termination); in Rom 10:4 context, Paul's argument (vv.5-8, quoting Deut 30) and his broader Romans theology (3:31, 7:12, 8:4) support "goal/purpose"
- Classified as E061 (Neutral) because the verse itself is ambiguous

### Gal 3:24
- Analyzed in: law-09, law-16, law-17, law-21, law-29
- Key finding: The paidagogos metaphor describes the law's custodial function, not its content; "no longer under a schoolmaster" does not mean moral standards were abolished
- Classified as E059 (Neutral)

### 2 Cor 3:7
- Analyzed in: law-01, law-03, law-07, law-08, law-11, law-19, law-21, law-29, law-30
- Key finding: katargoumenen (feminine singular) agrees grammatically with doxa (glory, feminine), not with entole or nomos; the word nomos never appears in 2 Cor 3; the subject throughout is diakonia (ministry)
- The passage is about the fading glory of the old-covenant ministry, not the abolition of the law itself
- Classified as E048 (Neutral)

## Key Greek Vocabulary Patterns

### katargeo (G2673) — "to abolish, make void"
- 27 NT occurrences
- Used for: abolishing death (2 Tim 1:10), destroying body of sin (Rom 6:6), fading glory (2 Cor 3:7,11,13)
- Critical: Paul denies katargeo applies to "the law" in Rom 3:31
- In Eph 2:15, what is katargeo'd is "the law of commandments in ordinances" (ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin)

### dogma (G1378) — "decree/ordinance"
- 5 NT occurrences: Luke 2:1 (Caesar's decree), Acts 16:4 (council decrees), Acts 17:7 (Caesar's decrees), Eph 2:15, Col 2:14
- In law contexts (Eph 2:15, Col 2:14): always the term for what was abolished
- Never used for the Decalogue or moral law

### cheirographon (G5498) — "handwriting"
- NT hapax legomenon (Col 2:14 only)
- Means "hand-written" (cheir + grapho)
- Contrasts with God's finger-writing on stone tablets

### entole (G1785) — "commandment"
- 71 NT occurrences
- Content identification: when content is specified, it is consistently moral/Decalogue
- Used for: "commandments of God" (Rev 12:17; 14:12), Jesus's "my commandments" (Jhn 14:15)
- Never used in NT for ceremonial ordinances that were abolished

### nomos (G3551) — "law"
- 194 NT occurrences
- Has the broadest semantic range: can refer to Pentateuch, Decalogue, ceremonial system, operating principle
- The articular/anarthrous pattern does NOT reliably distinguish categories (N103)

## I-B Resolution Summary

All I-B items across 30 studies resolve by the SIS protocol (plain passages interpret ambiguous ones). No I-B item was classified as "Unresolved" in the final evidence database. The I-B items classified as Abolished (22) represent claims where some textual support exists but the weight of the plain-text evidence resolves them toward the Continues direction per the methodology's SIS protocol. However, they remain classified by the direction of the claim itself, not the resolution.
