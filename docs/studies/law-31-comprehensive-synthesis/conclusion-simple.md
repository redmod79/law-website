# What Does the Bible Say About God's Law?

## A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence

For centuries, Christians have debated a fundamental question: What does the Bible say about God's law? Was it abolished when Christ died on the cross, or are believers still required to keep it? If we're still bound by God's law, which laws apply — and does this include the Sabbath commandment?

This question touches the heart of Christian faith and practice. Some argue that Christ's death freed us from all law-keeping, replacing it with grace alone. Others contend that God's moral law — the Ten Commandments — remains binding, while the ceremonial and civil laws of ancient Israel have passed away. Still others take middle positions, suggesting some commandments continue while others were abolished.

To answer this question properly, we need to examine what the Bible actually says, not what we might wish it said or what tradition has taught. This summary presents the findings from a comprehensive investigation of every significant Bible passage about God's law, examining the evidence systematically to see where the weight of Scripture falls.

## Two Distinct Types of Law in the Bible

The Bible presents a clear distinction between different types of law that God gave to His people. Understanding this distinction is crucial to interpreting the passages about law correctly.

**The Ten Commandments received unique treatment:**

God spoke the Ten Commandments directly to the assembled people with His own voice:

> "And God spake all these words, saying, I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me..." (Exodus 20:1-3)

> "These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more" (Deuteronomy 5:22)

God then wrote these commandments with His own finger on stone tablets:

> "And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God" (Exodus 31:18)

> "And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables" (Exodus 32:16)

These stone tablets were placed inside the Ark of the Covenant:

> "And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee" (Exodus 25:16)

> "There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel" (1 Kings 8:9)

**The other laws were handled differently:**

All other legislation was mediated through Moses and written in a book:

> "And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi" (Deuteronomy 31:9)

> "And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, that Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying, Take this book of the law, and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God" (Deuteronomy 31:24-26)

Moses himself explicitly distinguished between these two categories:

> "And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments" (Deuteronomy 4:13-14)

This distinction is not a theological theory imposed on the text — it's what the Bible itself says about how God delivered His law. The Ten Commandments received unique treatment: God's direct voice, God's own finger-writing, stone tablets, placement inside the ark, and explicit separation from other legislation.

## What the Bible Says About the Nature of God's Law

The Bible describes God's law using language that suggests permanence and reflects God's own character:

> "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (Romans 7:12)

> "For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin" (Romans 7:14)

> "The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether" (Psalm 19:7-9)

> "For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven" (Psalm 119:89)

> "Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever" (Psalm 119:152)

These attributes — holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, sure, true, enduring forever — are the same attributes the Bible ascribes to God's character. This suggests that God's law reflects His unchanging nature rather than being a temporary arrangement.

## What Jesus Said About the Law

Jesus addressed the question of the law's continuation directly in His most famous sermon:

> "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:17-19)

This passage makes several key points:
- Jesus came to fulfill, not destroy the law
- The law's validity continues until "heaven and earth pass"
- Even the smallest details of the law remain in force
- Those who break and teach others to break the commandments will be least in the kingdom
- Those who keep and teach the commandments will be great in the kingdom

When people asked Jesus directly about eternal life, He pointed them to the Ten Commandments:

> "And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (Matthew 19:16-19)

Jesus didn't say "just have faith" or "grace has replaced the law." He said "keep the commandments" and then listed specific commandments from the Ten Commandments.

In the same sermon where He said He didn't come to destroy the law, Jesus deepened several of the Ten Commandments, showing their spiritual application:

> "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment" (Matthew 5:21-22)

> "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart" (Matthew 5:27-28)

Rather than abolishing these commandments, Jesus was expanding their application to show their full spiritual meaning.

## What the Apostle Paul Taught About the Law

Paul's teaching about the law has been the source of much confusion, but when we examine all of his statements together, a clear pattern emerges.

**Paul affirmed the law's value and continuation:**

> "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law" (Romans 3:31)

This is one of Paul's clearest statements on the subject. Faith doesn't abolish the law — it establishes the law.

> "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Romans 8:4)

The purpose of Christ's work was that the law's righteousness would be fulfilled in believers who walk by the Spirit.

> "By the law is the knowledge of sin" (Romans 3:20)

> "I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet" (Romans 7:7)

Paul quotes the tenth commandment as his example of how the law reveals sin. If the law were abolished, it could no longer define sin.

**Paul defined love in terms of commandment-keeping:**

> "Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilment of the law" (Romans 13:8-10)

Paul lists specific commandments from the Ten Commandments as the content that love fulfills. Love doesn't replace these commandments — love fulfills them by keeping them.

> "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God" (1 Corinthians 7:19)

Paul distinguishes between circumcision (a ceremonial law) and "the commandments of God" (the moral law). Circumcision doesn't matter, but keeping God's commandments does.

**What about Paul's statements on freedom from law?**

Paul does speak about being "not under the law" and "dead to the law." But when we examine these statements in context alongside his affirmations of the law, a different picture emerges.

When Paul says "ye are not under the law" in Romans 6:14, he's in the middle of an argument about freedom from sin's dominion. The same Paul who says we're "not under the law" also says the law is "holy, just, and good" (Romans 7:12) and that we "establish the law" through faith (Romans 3:31). Paul isn't contradicting himself — he's distinguishing between the law as a system of condemnation and the law as God's moral standard.

Being "not under the law" means not under its condemnation — Christ bore that penalty. But this doesn't eliminate the law as a guide for Christian living. As Paul himself says, the righteousness of the law is to be fulfilled in believers who walk by the Spirit.

## What Was Actually Abolished

The Bible does speak about certain laws being abolished or removed. But it's important to see exactly what the text identifies as abolished.

**The "handwriting of ordinances" was nailed to the cross:**

> "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross" (Colossians 2:14)

The Greek phrase here is "cheirographon tois dogmasin" — literally "handwritten ordinances" or "handwritten decrees." This technical vocabulary is never used in the New Testament for the Ten Commandments. The context of Colossians 2 goes on to specify what this includes:

> "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ" (Colossians 2:16-17)

The things abolished are "shadows" — ceremonial observances that pointed forward to Christ. The weekly Sabbath is not called a shadow in the Bible; it points backward to creation, not forward to Christ.

**The law "contained in ordinances" was abolished:**

> "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances" (Ephesians 2:15)

Again, the Greek specifies "en dogmasin" — "in ordinances" or "in decrees." This is ceremonial terminology, not the vocabulary used for the Ten Commandments.

**What the New Covenant removes and establishes:**

The book of Hebrews explains what the New Covenant accomplishes:

> "In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away" (Hebrews 8:13)

> "Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all" (Hebrews 10:9-10)

What is removed? Hebrews 9:1 specifies: "ordinances of divine service." Hebrews 10:1-4 explains: the animal sacrifices that could never take away sin.

What is established? The same chapter tells us:

> "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them" (Hebrews 10:16)

The New Covenant removes the sacrificial system and writes God's law on hearts. It doesn't abolish the moral law — it internalizes it.

---

## The Definition of Sin

One of the clearest indications that the moral law continues is how the Bible defines sin:

> "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4)

This is a definitional statement. Sin IS the transgression of the law. If there were no continuing law, there would be no continuing sin. But the Bible clearly teaches that sin continues to exist and that believers are called to avoid it.

This definition assumes an operating law. You cannot transgress a law that doesn't exist. John wrote this decades after the cross, indicating that the law that defines sin was still in effect when he wrote.

---

## God's End-Time People

The book of Revelation, written near the end of the New Testament period, describes God's faithful people in terms of commandment-keeping:

> "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ" (Revelation 12:17)

> "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12)

> "Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city" (Revelation 22:14)

These passages describe God's people as those who "keep the commandments of God." This is the same phrase John uses throughout his epistles to describe the test of genuine faith:

> "And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him" (1 John 2:3-4)

> "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous" (1 John 5:3)

The New Testament consistently presents commandment-keeping as the mark of genuine faith, not as legalism or works-righteousness.

## The Sabbath Question

The fourth commandment — "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy" — is often singled out as the one commandment that was supposedly abolished. But the biblical evidence points in the opposite direction.

**The Sabbath was established at creation:**

> "And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made" (Genesis 2:2-3)

The fourth commandment itself points back to creation as the basis for Sabbath observance:

> "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it" (Exodus 20:8-11)

The Sabbath's foundation is not the Sinai covenant or Jewish law, but the creation itself. Jesus confirmed this when He said:

> "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath" (Mark 2:27)

The Greek word for "man" here is "anthropos," meaning humanity in general, not specifically the Jewish people.

**Jesus observed the Sabbath:**

> "And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read" (Luke 4:16)

This was Jesus's regular practice. When He healed on the Sabbath, He wasn't violating the Sabbath but showing what was appropriate Sabbath activity:

> "And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days" (Matthew 12:11-12)

Jesus never declared the Sabbath abolished. Instead, He declared Himself "Lord of the sabbath" (Mark 2:28) — claiming authority over it, not abolishing it.

**The women observed the Sabbath after the crucifixion:**

> "And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment" (Luke 23:56)

Even after Jesus died, His followers continued to observe the Sabbath "according to the commandment." If the Sabbath had been abolished by the cross, Luke would have noted this significant change.

**Paul continued Sabbath observance:**

> "And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures" (Acts 17:2)

> "And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks" (Acts 18:4)

Paul's regular practice was Sabbath synagogue attendance. In Acts 18:4, he was teaching both Jews and Greeks (Gentiles) on the Sabbath, indicating this wasn't merely cultural accommodation but principled practice.

**The Sabbath is distinct from ceremonial sabbaths:**

The Bible distinguishes between the weekly Sabbath and the annual ceremonial sabbaths:

> "These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day: Beside the sabbaths of the LORD" (Leviticus 23:37-38)

The annual feast sabbaths are listed, and then the text says these are "beside the sabbaths of the LORD" — indicating the weekly Sabbath is in a different category.

When Colossians 2:16 mentions "sabbath days" that are shadows, the context identifies these as part of the ceremonial system that was abolished — the annual sabbaths connected to the feast days, not the weekly Sabbath that commemorates creation.

**The Sabbath continues into the future:**

> "For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD" (Isaiah 66:22-23)

Isaiah prophesies that in the new earth, "all flesh" will worship God "from one sabbath to another." The Sabbath spans from creation to the new creation.

The book of Hebrews speaks of a continuing Sabbath rest:

> "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his" (Hebrews 4:9-10)

The Greek word translated "rest" in verse 9 is "sabbatismos" — literally "a keeping of sabbath" or "sabbath observance." This indicates that Sabbath-keeping remains for God's people.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

It's important to address some common misconceptions about what the Bible teaches on this topic.

**The Bible does not say that the entire law was abolished as one unit.** Every New Testament passage that speaks of abolition uses specific terminology to identify what was removed. The "handwriting of ordinances" (Colossians 2:14), the law "contained in ordinances" (Ephesians 2:15), and the "ordinances of divine service" (Hebrews 9:1) all point to the ceremonial system, not the moral law.

**The Bible does not say that love replaces the commandments.** Instead, it defines love as the keeping of commandments: "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments" (1 John 5:3). Love is the motive for obedience, not a substitute for it.

**The Bible does not establish Sunday as a replacement for the Sabbath.** While the New Testament mentions the first day of the week several times, no passage commands its observance, calls it holy, or transfers Sabbath obligations to it. The references to the first day are descriptive (recording what happened) rather than prescriptive (commanding what should happen).

**The Bible does not teach that the moral law was only for Israel.** Romans 2:14-15 speaks of Gentiles who "do by nature the things contained in the law" and have "the work of the law written in their hearts." Isaiah 56:6-7 explicitly includes "the sons of the stranger" (foreigners) who keep the Sabbath and take hold of God's covenant. The moral law reflects God's character, which is universal.

**The Bible does not present faith and obedience as opposites.** Faith establishes the law (Romans 3:31), and genuine faith expresses itself through obedience (James 2:17-26). The righteousness of the law is fulfilled in those who walk by the Spirit (Romans 8:4).

**The Bible does not say that keeping commandments is legalism.** John specifically states that God's commandments "are not grievous" (1 John 5:3). Jesus said His yoke is "easy" and His burden "light" (Matthew 11:30). The problem is not with commandment-keeping but with trying to earn salvation through works rather than receiving it by faith.

## Conclusion

When we examine all the biblical evidence together, a clear picture emerges. The Bible consistently teaches that God's moral law — the Ten Commandments, including the Sabbath — continues to be binding on believers. This law reflects God's unchanging character and provides the standard for Christian conduct.

The Bible does teach that certain laws were abolished — specifically, the ceremonial and sacrificial system that pointed forward to Christ. But the moral law is never identified as part of what was removed. Instead, the New Covenant writes this law on believers' hearts, empowering them to live by it through the Spirit.

The key biblical passages that support this conclusion include:

- Jesus's clear statement that He did not come to destroy the law (Matthew 5:17-19)
- Paul's declaration that faith establishes rather than abolishes the law (Romans 3:31)  
- The definition of sin as law-breaking (1 John 3:4)
- The description of God's end-time people as commandment-keepers (Revelation 14:12)
- The promise that God's laws will be written on hearts in the New Covenant (Hebrews 10:16)
- The specific identification of what was abolished using ceremonial vocabulary (Colossians 2:14; Ephesians 2:15)

Regarding the Sabbath specifically, the evidence shows that this commandment was established at creation, observed by Jesus and His followers, distinguished from ceremonial sabbaths, and prophesied to continue into the new earth. No biblical passage explicitly abolishes the weekly Sabbath or transfers its obligations to another day.

This doesn't mean that keeping the law earns salvation — the Bible is clear that salvation is by grace through faith. But it does mean that those who have been saved by grace will express their love for God through obedience to His commandments. As Jesus said: "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).

The moral law serves as God's standard of righteousness and the believer's guide for holy living. It reveals sin, points us to Christ for forgiveness, and then guides our conduct as we walk in fellowship with God. Faith doesn't abolish this law — faith establishes it, writing it on our hearts and enabling us to fulfill its righteousness through the power of the Holy Spirit.

## Supplemental Studies

Two additional studies were added after this synthesis to address questions that arise once the Sabbath's continuing validity has been established. They are not part of the moral-law-continues-vs-abolished analysis above — they are supplements to the Sabbath studies specifically.

- **Study 32 — Lunar Sabbaths:** Some claim the weekly Sabbath is governed by the lunar cycle (falling on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th of each month). The investigation found zero biblical texts connecting the Sabbath to the moon. Every line of evidence — lexical, structural, grammatical, narrative, and legislative — confirms the weekly Sabbath follows a continuous 7-day cycle independent of any celestial body.

- **Study 33 — Calendar Continuity:** Some argue that calendar changes or lost time make it impossible to know which day is the Sabbath. The investigation found that the crucifixion-resurrection sequence (Friday-Saturday-Sunday) anchors the Sabbath to Saturday, the manna cycle supernaturally marked it for 40 years, it was identifiable after the Babylonian captivity (Nehemiah 13), Jesus and the apostles kept it without any dispute over which day it was, and the 7-day weekly cycle has never been broken in recorded history.
