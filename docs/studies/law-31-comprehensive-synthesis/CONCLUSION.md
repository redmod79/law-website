# CONCLUSION: The Law of God — Comprehensive Synthesis of 30 Studies

## Question

What does the Bible say about God's law? Is it abolished, or are God's people still required to keep it? If so, which laws? Is the Sabbath still binding?

## Summary Answer

Across 30 studies examining 810 deduplicated evidence items, the Bible's explicit statements and necessary implications uniformly support the continuation of the moral law (the Ten Commandments, including the Sabbath). No explicit statement or necessary implication in the entire database supports the abolition of the moral law. Every NT passage that uses cessation vocabulary identifies its object through Greek terminology associated with the ceremonial/sacrificial system (dogma, cheirographon, dikaiomata sarkos, skia), not with the moral law (entole, the Decalogue). The Abolished position's claims exist entirely at the inference tier (I-B and I-D), requiring either the resolution of ambiguous passages against the weight of plain statements or the introduction of concepts the text does not contain.

## Key Verses

These are the passages most frequently cross-referenced across the 30-study series (appearing in the most studies), representing the core textual foundations of the investigation:

- **Rom 3:31** — "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." (14 studies)
- **1 Cor 7:19** — "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God." (14 studies)
- **Rom 7:12** — "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." (12 studies)
- **Mat 5:17-18** — "Think not that I am come to destroy the law...Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law." (10 studies)
- **Rom 8:4** — "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." (10 studies)
- **Heb 8:10; 10:16** — "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts." (9 studies)
- **Rom 13:8-10** — Paul lists Decalogue commandments as the content love fulfills. (9 studies)
- **Col 2:14** — "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances [cheirographon tois dogmasin]...nailing it to his cross." (9 studies)
- **Eph 2:15** — "Having abolished...the law of commandments contained in ordinances [en dogmasin]." (9 studies)
- **Rev 14:12** — "Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." (8 studies)
- **Rev 12:17** — "The remnant...which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ." (7 studies)
- **Col 2:16-17** — "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow." (7 studies)
- **Gal 3:19** — "Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come." (7 studies)
- **1 Jn 3:4** — "Sin is the transgression of the law." (5 studies)

**Total unique items (from law-evidence.db):** 810
**Integrity check:** 2 near-duplicate pairs identified and flagged; neither affects the positional balance since both members of each pair share the same classification (Continues):
- **E295 / E352**: Both quote 1 Jn 2:3-4 on commandment-keeping as the test of knowing God. E295 (from law-10) and E352 (from law-14) record the same verse with slightly different framing.
- **I103 / I109**: Both conclude "not under the law" (hypo nomon) = freedom from condemnation, not freedom from moral authority. I103 (from law-16) addresses Rom 6:14; I109 (from law-17) addresses Gal 5:18. These are the same interpretive conclusion applied to the same phrase in two epistles — arguably distinct applications, but the overlap is notable.
**Studies contributing:** law-01 through law-30

## What CAN Be Said (from E-tier evidence)

These statements rest on explicit biblical text — direct quotations or close paraphrases of what Scripture says:

1. **God spoke the Ten Commandments directly** to the assembled people with His own voice (Exo 20:1; Deu 5:4, 22), wrote them with His own finger on stone (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10), and commanded them to be placed inside the Ark of the Covenant (Exo 25:16, 21; 40:20; Deu 10:2, 5). "There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone" (1 Ki 8:9).

2. **Moses wrote a separate book of the law** and commanded it to be placed beside the ark (Deu 31:9, 24-26). Moses explicitly distinguished "his covenant, even ten commandments" from "statutes and judgments" (Deu 4:13-14). The people requested mediation after hearing God's voice (Exo 20:18-19), and God approved that request (Deu 5:28-31).

3. **The law is described as holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, pure, sure, true, and everlasting** (Rom 7:12, 14; Psa 19:7-9; Psa 111:7-8; Psa 119:89, 142, 144, 152, 160). "For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven" (Psa 119:89). "Every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever" (Psa 119:160).

4. **Jesus stated: "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil"** (Mat 5:17). He said not one jot or tittle would pass from the law till heaven and earth pass (Mat 5:18). He taught commandment-breakers would be least and commandment-keepers greatest in the kingdom (Mat 5:19). He deepened the Decalogue in the antitheses (Mat 5:21-48).

5. **Jesus directed inquirers to the Decalogue** as the path to life: "Keep the commandments" — then listed them (Mat 19:17-19; Mrk 10:19; Luk 18:20). He identified "judgment, mercy, and faith" as the weightier matters of the law (Mat 23:23).

6. **Sin is defined as transgression of the law** (1 Jn 3:4). "By the law is the knowledge of sin" (Rom 3:20). "I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet" (Rom 7:7 — quoting the 10th Commandment).

7. **Faith establishes, not abolishes, the law**: "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law" (Rom 3:31). "The righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Rom 8:4).

8. **The new covenant writes God's pre-existing law on hearts**: "I will put MY law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts" (Jer 31:33). "I will put MY laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Heb 8:10; 10:16). The possessive "my" identifies this as God's already-existing law, not new content.

9. **God's end-time people are characterized by keeping God's commandments**: "The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ" (Rev 12:17). "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Rev 14:12). "Blessed are they that do his commandments" (Rev 22:14).

10. **Paul identifies the content of love as Decalogue commandments**: "Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilment of the law" (Rom 13:9-10).

11. **What was abolished is specified by its own vocabulary**: "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances [cheirographon tois dogmasin]" (Col 2:14). "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances [ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin]" (Eph 2:15). The Greek terms cheirographon (hand-written) and dogma (ordinance/decree) are never used for the Decalogue.

12. **Paul distinguishes circumcision (ceremonial) from commandments (moral)**: "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God" (1 Cor 7:19).

13. **The Sabbath is grounded in creation, not Sinai**: "Remember the sabbath day...for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth" (Exo 20:8-11). "God did rest the seventh day from all his works...There remaineth therefore a rest [sabbatismos] to the people of God" (Heb 4:4, 9). "The sabbath was made for man [anthropos — humanity]" (Mrk 2:27).

14. **Jesus habitually observed the Sabbath**: "As his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day" (Luk 4:16). He healed on the Sabbath, declaring it "lawful to do well on the sabbath days" (Mat 12:12). He never declared the Sabbath abolished, but declared Himself "Lord of the Sabbath" (Mrk 2:28).

15. **The women who followed Jesus rested on the Sabbath "according to the commandment"** after the crucifixion (Luk 23:56). Jesus instructed His followers to pray regarding flight in connection with the Sabbath in the context of future tribulation (Mat 24:20).

## What CAN Be Said (from N-tier evidence)

These statements follow unavoidably from the combination of explicit statements above:

1. **The Bible presents two categorically distinct modes of law delivery**: God spoke the Ten Commandments directly (E001, E002); other legislation was mediated through Moses (E098-E100, E121). This distinction is maintained across multiple authors and testaments (N001, N015).

2. **The Bible assigns different physical repositories**: the tablets inside the ark (E007, E008); the book beside the ark (E009). This is a textually observable distinction, not a theological category imposed on the text (N002).

3. **The attributes the Bible ascribes to the law (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, everlasting) are the same attributes ascribed to God's character** (N003). This links the moral law to God's unchanging nature.

4. **None of the seven primary NT abolition passages names the Decalogue, the Ten Commandments, or any specific moral commandment as its object** (N043). Each passage identifies its object through vocabulary associated with the ceremonial/sacrificial system.

5. **The new covenant passages simultaneously remove the sacrificial system and write God's laws on hearts** (N044, N052, N058). Heb 10:1-9 removes sacrifices; Heb 10:16 writes laws on hearts — in the same argument.

6. **Love is explicitly defined as commandment-keeping** in 1 Jn 5:3, not as a replacement for commandments (N054). "This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments."

7. **The NT vocabulary used in affirmation passages does not overlap with the vocabulary used in cessation passages** (N102). Entole (unqualified) = affirmation; dogma/cheirographon/dikaiomata sarkos = cessation.

8. **The Sabbath shares all seven unique Decalogue markers**: God's direct voice, God's finger-writing, stone medium, ark repository, explicit distinction from other legislation (Deu 4:13-14), "he added no more" boundary (Deu 5:22), and tables called "the covenant" (N120).

9. **No first-day passage commands, names, or establishes Sunday observance** (N134). Acts 20:7 is an evening meeting; 1 Cor 16:2 is private bookkeeping; Rev 1:10 does not identify which day.

10. **Jesus's habitual Sabbath observance, established before His public ministry, reflects His normal practice rather than situational conformity** (N065). Luke uses the Perfect Active Participle eiothos ("having been accustomed") — denoting established pattern.

11. **Paul uses katargeo (G2673) to abolish "the law of commandments in ordinances" (Eph 2:15) and simultaneously denies that faith katargeo-s "the law" (Rom 3:31)**. This demonstrates Paul distinguishes between categories of law within his own vocabulary (N047, N085).

12. **The equation in 1 John 3:4 — "the sin IS the lawlessness" (he hamartia estin he anomia) — with articular nouns and the copula estin establishes definitional equivalence, not partial overlap** (N073). Sin is defined as law-breaking, presupposing a continuing operative law.

## What CANNOT Be Said with Certainty (I-tier)

These claims rest on inference — they require adding something the text does not contain. Neither side can present these as what "the Bible says":

### Continues-Direction Inferences (82 items: 63 I-A, 18 I-B, 1 I-C)

The Continues position's inferences are predominantly I-A (evidence-extending) — systematizing E/N items into broader doctrinal claims. Examples:
- "The Bible teaches that the moral law must continue in force because the Bible ascribes to it attributes (eternal, perfect, holy) that preclude obsolescence" (I001-A). This systematizes E010-E020 but goes beyond any single verse.
- "The Bible teaches that the Sabbath is a creation ordinance, predating both Israel and Sinai" (I010-A). This combines Gen 2:2-3 with Exo 20:8-11 and Mrk 2:27 but the explicit statement of a binding pre-Sinai Sabbath command requires inference.
- "The Bible teaches that the seventh-day Sabbath is still binding for all believers" (I151-A). This systematizes all Sabbath evidence but is a doctrinal conclusion, not a single verse statement.

The Continues I-B items are textual tensions resolved toward Continues by SIS. They lean strongly in that direction but involve passages that the Abolished position also cites.

### Abolished-Direction Inferences (57 items: 22 I-B, 1 I-C, 34 I-D)

The Abolished position's inferences fall into two categories:

**I-B items (22):** These cite genuine textual data — but the ambiguous passages they rely on are resolved by plain passages in the opposite direction. Examples:
- "2 Corinthians 3:7-13 describes the abolition of the Decalogue" (I046-B). The passage references something "written on stones" and uses katargeo. But the grammatical subject of katargeo is the glory (feminine), not the law; nomos does not appear in the chapter; and the same author denies making the law void (Rom 3:31).
- "Paul's teaching in Romans abolishes the moral law" (I105-B). Paul says "not under the law" (Rom 6:14) and "dead to the law" (Rom 7:4). But in the same epistle, the law is holy/just/good (7:12), spiritual (7:14), established by faith (3:31), fulfilled in Spirit-walkers (8:4).
- "Col 2:16 sabbath days includes the weekly Sabbath, classifying it as a shadow" (I141-B). Sabbaton can refer to either weekly or annual sabbaths. But the triad context (heorte-neomenia-sabbaton) matches the OT ceremonial triad (Eze 45:17), and the cheirographon vocabulary specifies ceremonial ordinances.

**I-C items (5: 1 Continues, 1 Abolished, 3 Neutral):** These draw on evidence compatible with the biblical data but sourced from outside the text itself. I008-C (Neutral) asks whether the threefold division of the law is a valid hermeneutical framework — the textual distinctions exist, but the formal three-category taxonomy is a systematization. I037-C (Neutral) notes the LXX compression (Greek has fewer law terms than Hebrew) as a factor in NT ambiguity. I054-C (Continues) appeals to historical corroboration of the Decalogue's distinct treatment. I092-C (Abolished) proposes anomia in Mat 7:23 means general moral failure rather than Decalogue transgression. I125-C (Neutral) proposes the NT vocabulary pattern was intentionally designed as a categorical system. These items are minor in weight and do not shift the overall balance.

**I-D items (34):** These require overriding E/N statements with concepts the text does not contain. Examples:
- "The entire law system was abolished as a single unit" (I007-D). Requires overriding the textual distinctions between delivery modes, media, and repositories.
- "The Bible treats all law as a single indivisible unit" (I050-D). Requires denying the textual evidence of multiple categories (Deu 4:13-14; 1 Cor 7:19; Heb 10:1-9 vs. 10:16).
- "'My commandments' in Jhn 14:15 refers to new commandments Jesus invented" (I094-D). Requires overriding the consistent NT usage of entole for Decalogue content and Jesus's own identification of commandments as the Decalogue (Mat 19:17-19).
- "Christians should observe Sunday" (I155-D). No verse commands, names, or establishes first-day observance. Requires importing a tradition the text does not contain.

## Unresolved Items

**No I-B item in the evidence database was classified as genuinely "Unresolved."**

The closest to balanced tension is I124 (the articular/anarthrous nomos pattern), which was classified Neutral because the pattern does not reliably distinguish categories (N103 demonstrates exceptions in both directions). This item does not bear on whether the moral law continues or was abolished — it concerns a proposed linguistic test that proved unreliable.

All other I-B items were resolved Strong (36 items) or Moderate (4 items) through the SIS protocol. The dominant resolution pattern: plain didactic statements (Rom 3:31; 7:12; Mat 5:17-18; 1 Jn 3:4; Rev 14:12) interpret ambiguous passages (Rom 10:4; Gal 3:24; 2 Cor 3:7; Heb 8:13) in the Continues direction.

## The Sabbath Question Specifically

The Sabbath was investigated in five dedicated studies (law-13, law-24, law-25, law-26, law-27) and addressed in numerous others (law-01, law-03, law-04, law-14, law-28, law-29).

### What the E-tier evidence states about the Sabbath:

1. **Creation origin:** The Sabbath is grounded in creation, not Sinai. The Fourth Commandment cites "in six days the LORD made heaven and earth" (Exo 20:11). God rested, blessed, and sanctified the seventh day (Gen 2:2-3). Jesus said the Sabbath "was made for man" (anthropos — humanity, not Israel specifically) (Mrk 2:27).

2. **Decalogue membership:** The Sabbath is the fourth of the Ten Commandments, sharing all seven unique Decalogue markers: God's direct voice, God's finger-writing, stone medium, ark repository, explicit distinction from other legislation, "he added no more" boundary, and designation as "the covenant" (N120).

3. **Distinct from ceremonial sabbaths:** Leviticus 23:37-38 places the annual feast sabbaths "beside the sabbaths of the LORD" (E127). The weekly Sabbath uses a higher level of work prohibition (kol-melakhah, "all work") than feast sabbaths (kol-melekhet abodah, "all servile work") (E481). Numbers 28-29 treats the Sabbath offering as a distinct temporal category (E482). The weekly Sabbath is never called a moed or chag (E487, E488).

4. **Jesus's observance:** Jesus habitually attended synagogue on the Sabbath "as his custom was" (Luk 4:16; E320). He healed on the Sabbath, declaring it "lawful to do well" (Mat 12:12; E325). He declared Himself "Lord of the Sabbath" (Mrk 2:28) — asserting authority over, not abolition of, the day. In the Gospel record, Jesus never declared the Sabbath abolished, unnecessary, or transferred to another day (N075).

5. **Post-crucifixion observance:** The women "rested the sabbath day according to the commandment" (Luk 23:56; E333). Paul's pattern in Acts was Sabbath synagogue attendance (Acts 17:2; 18:4; E338, E339). Gentile believers requested to hear Paul on the next Sabbath (Acts 13:42, 44; E339).

6. **Prophetic extension:** Isaiah extends Sabbath blessings to "the sons of the stranger" (non-Israelites) (Isa 56:6-7; E095, E384). Isaiah prophesies that "from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD" (Isa 66:23; E096).

### What the N-tier evidence states:

- The Sabbath shares all seven unique Decalogue markers (N120).
- The pre-Sinai manna episode demonstrates the Sabbath's existence before the formal Sinai legislation (N121).
- Isaiah 56 explicitly extends Sabbath blessings to non-Israelites (N125).
- The Sabbath appears in three time frames: creation (Gen 2:2-3), present (Heb 4:9), and eschatological future (Isa 66:22-23) (N135).
- None of the three passages cited for Sabbath abolition (Col 2:16; Rom 14:5; Gal 4:10) contains the word sabbaton with an explicit identification as the weekly Sabbath (N133).
- No first-day passage commands or establishes Sunday observance (N134).

### What is inferred (I-tier):

- **Continues inferences:** The Sabbath is a creation ordinance pre-dating Israel (I010-A). The weekly Sabbath is a moral-law institution (I140-A). The seventh-day Sabbath is still binding (I151-A). These are I-A (evidence-extending) — they systematize the E/N evidence.
- **Abolished inferences:** Col 2:16 includes the weekly Sabbath (I141-B, resolved Strong against). Gal 4:10 includes the weekly Sabbath (I142-B, resolved Strong against). Rom 14:5 includes the weekly Sabbath (I143-B, resolved Strong against). The Sabbath was only for ethnic Israel (I154-D). Christians should observe Sunday (I155-D). These are I-B (resolved against the claim) or I-D (requiring override of the text).

### Summary on the Sabbath:

The explicit and necessary-implication evidence uniformly supports the seventh-day Sabbath's continuation: creation origin, Decalogue membership, Jesus's observance and teaching, apostolic practice, prophetic extension to all nations and into the eschaton, distinct vocabulary from ceremonial sabbaths. Every claim that the weekly Sabbath was abolished exists at the I-B level (resolved against the claim by SIS) or I-D level (requiring override of the text).

## Who Does the Moral Law Apply To?

A recurring question across the series is whether the moral law — and the Sabbath in particular — applies only to ethnic Israel or to all who follow God. The evidence database addresses this at every tier.

### E-tier: What the Bible explicitly states

**The moral law is presented as universal in scope:**

1. **Gentiles have the law written on their hearts**: "The Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law...the work of the law written in their hearts" (Rom 2:14-15; E037). Paul's argument in Romans 2 establishes that all humanity — Jew and Gentile — stands under God's moral standard.

2. **The Sabbath was "made for man"**: Jesus said "the sabbath was made for man [anthropos, G444], and not man for the sabbath" (Mrk 2:27; E087). The Greek anthropos is generic humanity — not Ioudaios (Jew), not Israel, not a specific ethnic group. The aorist egeneto ("was made") points back to the creation event.

3. **The Sabbath is grounded in creation, before any nation existed**: The Fourth Commandment cites its own rationale: "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth...and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it" (Exo 20:11; E340). God rested, blessed, and sanctified the seventh day at creation (Gen 2:2-3; E063) — centuries before Abraham, millennia before Sinai.

4. **Isaiah explicitly extends Sabbath blessings to non-Israelites**: "Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD...every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; even them will I bring to my holy mountain" (Isa 56:6-7; E095, E384). The "sons of the stranger" are foreigners — non-Israelites. God promises them the same Sabbath blessings.

5. **All flesh will keep the Sabbath in the new earth**: "From one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD" (Isa 66:23; E096). The eschatological scope is universal — "all flesh," not "Israel only."

6. **Paul taught Jews and Greeks together on the Sabbath**: "He reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath [kata pan sabbaton], and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks" (Acts 18:4; E505). Paul's habitual Sabbath practice included Gentile believers over 78 Sabbaths in Corinth alone.

7. **The same law applies to the stranger**: "Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God" (Lev 24:22; E175).

**The "sign between me and Israel" passages:**

The texts most commonly cited for an Israel-only Sabbath are Exodus 31:13, 17 and Ezekiel 20:12, 20:

- "It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth" (Exo 31:17; E489). The sign designation is paired with the creation rationale — the same rationale given in the Decalogue itself.
- "I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them" (Eze 20:12; E097).
- "Hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you" (Eze 20:20; E506).

These passages identify the Sabbath as a sign of the covenant relationship between God and His people. The question is whether "children of Israel" limits the Sabbath to ethnic Jews or describes the covenant community. Isaiah 56:6-7 answers this directly: foreigners who "join themselves to the LORD" and keep the Sabbath are brought into the same covenant relationship. The sign belongs to the covenant, and the covenant is open to all who join.

### N-tier: What follows unavoidably

- **Three independent channels attest the moral law**: nature/creation, conscience, and direct revelation (N045). All three are universal — none is ethnically restricted. Ceremonial and civil law, by contrast, required specific revelation to a specific nation.
- **The Sabbath predates Israel**: The pre-Sinai manna episode (Exo 16:4-30) demonstrates the Sabbath operating as an existing obligation before the Sinai legislation. God asks "How long refuse ye to keep my commandments?" (v.28) about Sabbath violation — before the formal giving of the law (N121).
- **Isaiah 56 explicitly extends Sabbath to non-Israelites** (N125). This is not inference — the text names "the sons of the stranger" and includes them.
- **The Sabbath spans the entire biblical timeline**: creation (Gen 2:2-3), the present era (Heb 4:9, sabbatismos currently remaining), and the new earth (Isa 66:22-23) (N135). An institution that predates Israel and extends past the eschaton into the new earth is not an ethnic marker.

### I-tier: What is inferred

- **Continues (I-A)**: "The moral law is universal, binding on all humans, not just Israel" (I004). "The Sabbath is a creation ordinance, not merely a Sinai institution" (I010). "'The Sabbath was made for man' establishes the Sabbath as a creation ordinance for all humanity — not a Jewish-specific institution" (I085). "The moral law is knowable independently of the Sinai revelation — through nature and conscience — which distinguishes it from ceremonial and civil law" (I051). These are evidence-extending inferences that systematize the E/N data above.
- **Abolished (I-D)**: "The Sabbath was only for ethnic Israel, not for Gentile believers" (I154). This is classified I-D because it requires overriding Isa 56:6-7 (foreigners included), Mrk 2:27 (anthropos = humanity), Isa 66:23 (all flesh), and Acts 18:4 (Greeks) by elevating "children of Israel" in Exo 31:16 above multiple universal statements.

### Summary on applicability

At the E and N tiers, the evidence consistently presents the moral law as universal: known through conscience (Rom 2:14-15), grounded in creation (Gen 2:2-3; Exo 20:11), applicable to the stranger (Lev 24:22), extended to foreigners (Isa 56:6-7), and encompassing "all flesh" eschatologically (Isa 66:23). The Sabbath specifically was made for "man" (anthropos — humanity), existed before Israel, operates in the present, and continues into the new earth. The "sign between me and Israel" passages identify the Sabbath as a covenant sign — and Isaiah 56 explicitly opens that covenant to non-Israelites who join themselves to the LORD. The claim that the Sabbath was only for ethnic Israel exists at the I-D tier (I154), requiring override of multiple explicit texts.

## Final Conclusion

The evidence database contains 810 unique items classified across three tiers: 513 Explicit (E), 145 Necessary Implication (N), and 152 Inference (I).

At the highest evidence tiers (E and N — 658 items total), the Continues position has 219 items. The Abolished position has 0 items.

At the I-A tier (strongest inference, 66 items), the Continues position has 63 items. The Abolished position has 0 items.

At the I-B tier (competing evidence, 47 items), the Continues position has 18 items and the Abolished position has 22 items. All 22 Abolished I-B items were resolved through the SIS protocol Strong against the Abolished claim (toward Continues).

At the I-D tier (weakest inference, 34 items), all 34 items support the Abolished position. Each requires overriding what the text says with concepts the text does not contain.

The evidence hierarchy (E > N > I-A > I-B > I-C > I-D) governs interpretation. Higher-tier evidence determines the reading of lower-tier claims. The 219 E+N items supporting Continues (detailed above under "What CAN Be Said") establish the interpretive framework within which lower-tier claims must be read. The 57 Abolished-direction inferences (all at I-B or I-D, detailed above under "What CANNOT Be Said") do not override what the explicit statements and necessary implications establish. The I-B resolutions (tabulated above) show that every contested passage is resolved by the SIS protocol toward the Continues position when read alongside the plain didactic statements.
