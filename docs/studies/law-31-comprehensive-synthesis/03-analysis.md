# Comprehensive Synthesis Analysis — The Law of God (30-Study Series)

## Series Overview

This series investigated the central question: **What does the Bible say about God's law? Is it abolished, or are God's people still required to keep it? If so, which laws? Is the Sabbath still binding?**

Two positions were investigated:
- **Continues position**: God's moral laws (the Ten Commandments, including the seventh-day Sabbath) remain binding. What was abolished was the ceremonial/sacrificial system and civil/judicial laws in their specific theocratic form.
- **Abolished position**: The law (including the Ten Commandments and Sabbath) was done away with at the cross. Christians are under a "new law" or "law of Christ" that replaces the old.

Both positions agree (common ground) that ceremonial laws (sacrifices, feasts, purity regulations, circumcision) and civil/judicial laws in their specific theocratic form ceased. The debate concerns the moral law alone.

### Study Progression

**Phase 1 — OT Foundations (law-01 through law-07):**
- law-01: Established the nature of God's moral law — its attributes (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, perpetual), its role (defines sin, reflects God's character), and its scope (creation to end-time).
- law-02: Examined pre-Sinai evidence for a moral law operative before the formal Mosaic codification, including patriarchal moral accountability, Genesis 26:5 vocabulary, and the clean/unclean distinction before Leviticus.
- law-03: Analyzed the Exodus narrative's own distinction between the Decalogue and later legislation — different modes of delivery, different media, different repositories, different naming conventions.
- law-04: Catalogued the ceremonial/ritual laws — sacrifices, feasts, purity regulations, sanctuary service — and their designation as shadows/types fulfilled in Christ.
- law-05: Examined civil/judicial laws — case laws (mishpatim), penalties, restitution formulas, judicial procedures, cities of refuge — and their transfer from theocratic to church/state forms in the NT.
- law-06: Investigated the Hebrew law vocabulary (torah, mitsvah, choq, mishpat, eduth, piqqud, chuqqah) — their semantic ranges, distribution, and whether they encode categorical distinctions.
- law-07: Analyzed the phrase "the law of Moses" — its 21 OT/NT occurrences, its relationship to "the law of God" and "the law of the LORD," and whether it refers to a single undifferentiated body or allows categorical distinction.

**Phase 2 — NT Abolition and Covenant Analysis (law-08 through law-11):**
- law-08: Examined the seven primary NT "abolition passages" (Col 2:14, Eph 2:15, Heb 7:12, Heb 8:13, Heb 10:1-9, 2 Cor 3:7-13, Gal 3:24-25) — what each actually says was abolished, what Greek vocabulary each uses.
- law-09: Investigated the old covenant and new covenant — what each consists of, what changed and what remained.
- law-10: Examined whether the new covenant abolishes or establishes the moral law — Jer 31:33, Heb 8:10, 10:16, Eze 36:27, Rom 3:31.
- law-11: Analyzed the specific content of "my law" written on hearts — tracing the possessive pronoun chain, the stone-to-heart medium shift, and the Psalm 40/Hebrews 10 connection.

**Phase 3 — Jesus's Teaching (law-12 through law-14):**
- law-12: Deep analysis of Matthew 5:17-20 — kataluo vs. pleroo, the "not one jot or tittle" statement, the six antitheses.
- law-13: Examined Jesus's Sabbath actions and teachings — His habitual observance, "Lord of the Sabbath," "the Sabbath was made for man," healing controversies.
- law-14: Jesus's broader law teachings — the love commands, the Golden Rule, commandment-keeping as condition of eternal life, anomia as the sin of the end-time.

**Phase 4 — Apostolic Teaching (law-15 through law-19):**
- law-15: The Jerusalem Council (Acts 15) — what was decided, the four prohibitions, the distinction between Jews and Gentiles regarding the law, James's statement about Moses being read every Sabbath.
- law-16: Paul's teaching in Romans — justification by faith, "not under the law," "dead to the law," the law as holy/just/good/spiritual, "establish the law."
- law-17: Paul's argument in Galatians — circumcision controversy, "schoolmaster," "no longer under," while affirming moral content (Gal 5:14, 19-23, 6:2).
- law-18: Hebrews 8-10 — priesthood change, covenant change, sacrifice removal, and the simultaneous writing of God's laws on hearts.
- law-19: 2 Corinthians 3 — the ministration of death/glory analysis, grammatical gender of katargoumenen, diakonia vs. nomos.

**Phase 5 — Greek Vocabulary Studies (law-20 through law-23):**
- law-20: Comprehensive NT Greek law vocabulary — entole (G1785), nomos (G3551), dogma (G1378), dikaioma (G1345), cheirographon (G5498), entalma (G1778).
- law-21: How NT vocabulary encodes law categories — the affirmation/cessation partition, the articular/anarthrous nomos pattern, each vocabulary term's distribution.
- law-22: James and the law — "the royal law," "the law of liberty," "the whole law," James's Decalogue identification, the lawgiver passage.
- law-23: The "law of Christ" (Gal 6:2) — its content, its relationship to "law of liberty," "law of the Spirit of life," "law of God."

**Phase 6 — The Sabbath Question (law-24 through law-27):**
- law-24: Weekly Sabbath vs. ceremonial sabbaths — Leviticus 23 vocabulary levels, moed/chag designations, the Numbers 28-29 offering structure.
- law-25: Is the Sabbath moral or ceremonial? — creation origin, Decalogue membership, the seven unique markers the Sabbath shares with the Decalogue.
- law-26: Do Colossians 2:16-17 and related passages abolish the weekly Sabbath? — the heorte-neomenia-sabbaton triad, the "shadow" designation, Romans 14:5 and Galatians 4:10.
- law-27: Is the seventh-day Sabbath still in effect? — sabbatismos in Hebrews 4:9, Isaiah 56/58/66 prophecies, first-day passages, post-crucifixion Sabbath observance.

**Phase 7 — Final Studies (law-28 through law-30):**
- law-28: Revelation and the commandments — entole in Revelation, the Rev 14:7/Exo 20:11 parallel, "commandments of God" as Decalogue identifier.
- law-29: What specific laws continue and what ceased — a systematic catalogue of every NT-specified continuation and cessation item.
- law-30: Romans 10:4 — the meaning of telos, all 42 NT occurrences analyzed, the syntactic construction telos + genitive.

### Key E-tier Items — Continues Position (146 items)

The 146 E-tier Continues items fall into these categories:

1. **Law attributes (E010-E020, E044-E047, E052):** The law is holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, everlasting, settled in heaven, true from the beginning. The word of God endures forever.

2. **Jesus's affirmation (E021-E022, E041, E043, E195, E293, E316, E323-E325, E328, E333-E337, E339, E342, E344-E345, E348-E362, E365):** "Not come to destroy" (Mat 5:17-18), "not one tittle shall pass," the antitheses deepening the Decalogue, habitual Sabbath observance, "Lord of the Sabbath," Sabbath healing as lawful, the women's Sabbath rest "according to the commandment."

3. **Decalogue distinction markers (E001-E009, E098-E106, E118, E121, E126-E128, E212, E264-E265):** God spoke the Ten Commandments directly; Moses mediated later laws. Tablets written by God's finger; the book written by Moses. Tablets inside the ark; book beside the ark. Deu 4:13-14 explicitly distinguishes categories.

4. **New covenant internalization (E038-E040, E271-E272, E274, E282, E285, E288, E303-E308):** "My law" written on hearts — the same Decalogue content, transferred from stone to heart.

5. **NT law affirmation (E023-E033, E037, E143, E261, E389, E391, E394, E397-E401, E422-E427, E457, E459-E460, E463, E465, E467-E468, E470, E481-E482, E489-E491, E500, E511, E519):** Sin is transgression of the law. Faith establishes the law. Love fulfills the law. Commandment-keeping characterizes God's people. Entole consistently = moral content.

6. **Sabbath-specific (E086, E088, E095-E096, E126-E128, E323-E340, E384, E387, E481-E482, E489-E491, E500, E511):** Creation origin, Decalogue membership, Isaiah's Sabbath prophecies, Jesus's Sabbath observance, sabbatismos, Leviticus 23 vocabulary distinction.

7. **Cessation vocabulary specifying ceremonial content (E053-E054):** Eph 2:15 uses dogma; Col 2:14 uses cheirographon tois dogmasin. These are classified Continues because the text itself identifies what was abolished as ceremonial ordinances, not the moral law.

### Key E-tier Items — Abolished Position (0 items)

No explicit statement in the evidence database directly states that the moral law (Decalogue, Ten Commandments, including the Sabbath) was abolished, terminated, or made void. Every NT passage that uses cessation vocabulary identifies its object using terminology associated with the ceremonial/sacrificial system (dogma, cheirographon, dikaiomata sarkos, skia) rather than with the moral law (entole, the Decalogue).

### Key E-tier Items — Neutral (367 items)

The 367 Neutral E-items include:
- Textual observations both sides accept (e.g., "Christ is the end [telos] of the law" — E061; "the law was our schoolmaster" — E059)
- Greek grammar and vocabulary facts (e.g., katargoumenen is feminine singular — E251; nomos does not appear in 2 Cor 3 — E454)
- Ceremonial and civil law cessation items (shared ground)
- Pre-Sinai evidence (E063-E085)
- Historical and lexical data (E208-E247)
- Disputed passage quotations where the referent of "law" is ambiguous (E055-E062)

### Key N-tier Items — Continues Position (73 items)

The 73 N-tier Continues items include:
- The Bible presents two different modes of delivery for the Decalogue and other legislation (N001)
- The Bible assigns different repositories to the Decalogue and the book of the law (N002)
- The attributes ascribed to the law match attributes ascribed to God's character (N003)
- The NT cessation vocabulary never uses entole for what was abolished (N018, N043, N097)
- The new covenant passages simultaneously remove sacrifices and write laws on hearts (N044, N052-N058)
- Love is explicitly defined as commandment-keeping (N054)
- Jesus's habitual Sabbath observance established before His ministry (N065)
- The Sabbath shares all seven unique Decalogue markers (N120)

### Key N-tier Items — Abolished Position (0 items)

No necessary implication in the evidence database supports the abolition of the moral law. Every N-tier item is classified either Continues or Neutral.

### I-tier Distribution

**I-A (Evidence-Extending): 66 items**
- 63 Continues, 0 Abolished, 3 Neutral
- These systematize E/N items into broader doctrinal claims. All Abolished claims at I-A would need to systematize E/N items that support abolition — but no such E/N items exist.

**I-B (Competing-Evidence): 47 items**
- 18 Continues, 22 Abolished, 7 Neutral
- These are genuine textual tensions where both sides cite Scripture. Each was subjected to the SIS (Scripture Interprets Scripture) protocol.

**I-C (Compatible External): 5 items**
- 1 Continues (I054 — historical evidence corroborating the distinction), 1 Abolished (I092 — anomia as general moral failure), 3 Neutral

**I-D (Counter-Evidence External): 34 items**
- 0 Continues, 34 Abolished, 0 Neutral
- Every I-D item requires overriding, redefining, or qualifying what E/N statements say. All 34 are Abolished-direction claims.

## Key Contested Passages — Cross-Study Analysis

### Colossians 2:14 — "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances"

**Studies analyzing:** law-01, law-04, law-05, law-07, law-08, law-20, law-21, law-26, law-29

**Findings:**
- The Greek cheirographon (G5498, "hand-written") is a NT hapax legomenon. It means a document written by hand — contrasting with God's finger-writing on stone (Exo 31:18).
- The word tois dogmasin (G1378, "in/by ordinances") specifies what the handwriting consisted of. Dogma in the NT's other four occurrences means "decree/edict" (Luke 2:1; Acts 16:4; 17:7) and "ordinance" (Eph 2:15).
- The conjunction oun ("therefore") in Col 2:16 causally connects the nailing of the cheirographon (v.14) to the "let no man judge you" regarding food, drink, feast days, new moons, and sabbaths (v.16) — all ceremonial categories.
- **Classification:** E054 (Continues) — because the text itself specifies its object using non-Decalogue vocabulary.

### Matthew 5:17 — "Think not that I am come to destroy the law"

**Studies analyzing:** law-09, law-10, law-12, law-14, law-29, law-30

**Findings:**
- Jesus uses kataluo (G2647, "to destroy/demolish") — a word used 17 times in the NT, predominantly for physical destruction (temple, buildings). He explicitly denies coming to kataluo the law.
- The contrast word pleroo (G4137, "to fill up/fulfil") in context (vv.18-19: "not one jot or tittle shall pass," commandment-breakers least in kingdom, commandment-keepers greatest) means to fill full the law's meaning, not to complete-and-terminate it.
- The six antitheses (Mat 5:21-48) demonstrate fulfillment by deepening/expanding commandments, not by replacing them.
- **Classification:** E021 (Continues)

### Romans 10:4 — "Christ is the end of the law"

**Studies analyzing:** law-16, law-30

**Findings:**
- Telos (G5056) has multiple senses: goal/purpose, completion/culmination, outcome/result, termination/cessation, tax/tribute. Of 42 NT occurrences, only 4 (10%) carry the "cessation" sense.
- The syntactic construction telos + genitive of law/commandment also appears in 1 Tim 1:5 ("the end [telos] of the commandment is love") where termination is excluded.
- Paul's own context: Rom 3:31 (faith establishes the law), Rom 7:12 (law is holy/just/good), Rom 8:4 (law's righteousness fulfilled in us), Rom 10:5-8 (quoting Deut 30 approvingly).
- **Classification:** E061 (Neutral) — the verse is genuine ambiguity; both "goal" and "end" readings are grammatically possible.

### 2 Corinthians 3:7-11 — "The ministration of death...done away"

**Studies analyzing:** law-01, law-03, law-07, law-08, law-11, law-19, law-21, law-29, law-30

**Findings:**
- The word nomos (G3551, "law") does not appear anywhere in 2 Corinthians 3 (E454).
- Paul's subject throughout is diakonia ("ministry/ministration"), not the law itself (N094).
- katargoumenen in v.7 is feminine singular — agreeing with doxa (glory, feminine), not with entole or nomos (N041).
- The neuter substantivized participles (to katargoumenon in v.11, tou katargoumenou in v.13) have no feminine or masculine antecedent, referring to the abstract old-covenant arrangement (N095).
- Paul, the same author, explicitly denies making the law void in Rom 3:31 using the same verb katargeo.
- **Classification:** E048 (Neutral). The I-B inference that this passage abolishes the Decalogue (I046) was resolved Strong toward Continues.

### Galatians 3:24-25 — "No longer under a schoolmaster"

**Studies analyzing:** law-09, law-16, law-17, law-21, law-29

**Findings:**
- The paidagogos (tutor/guardian) metaphor describes the law's custodial and convicting function, not its content.
- "No longer under a paidagogos" means the believer is no longer under the law's condemnation/custodial custody — not that moral standards are abolished.
- The specific controversy in Galatians is circumcision and ceremonial observance (Gal 2:3, 12; 4:10; 5:2-6; 6:12-15), not the moral law (N086).
- Paul affirms the moral law's content in the same letter: Gal 5:14 (love fulfills the law), 5:19-21 (Decalogue violations are "works of the flesh"), 5:22-23 (against the fruit of the Spirit "there is no law").
- **Classification:** E059 (Neutral)

### Hebrews 8:13 — "He hath made the first old...ready to vanish away"

**Studies analyzing:** law-09, law-10, law-11, law-18

**Findings:**
- Hebrews 8:13 states the first covenant was made old (palaioō) and is near vanishing (aphanismos).
- The same passage (Heb 8:10) simultaneously quotes Jer 31:33: "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts."
- The "first covenant" is specified by its content in Heb 9:1 — "ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary" — i.e., the tabernacle/sacrificial system.
- Heb 10:1-9 removes the sacrificial "first" and establishes God's will. Heb 10:16 writes God's laws on hearts.
- **Classification:** E057 (Neutral). The I-B inference that "vanishing away" means the entire old covenant including the moral law is abolished (I058) was resolved Strong toward Continues by N044, N052, N092.

### Ephesians 2:15 — "Having abolished...the law of commandments contained in ordinances"

**Studies analyzing:** law-01, law-08, law-20, law-21, law-29

**Findings:**
- The Greek reads ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin — "the law of the commandments in ordinances/decrees."
- The progressive narrowing: nomos (broadest) > entolon (commandments, genitive qualifier) > en dogmasin (in/by ordinances, further qualifier).
- Dogma is the same word used in Col 2:14 for what was nailed to the cross.
- Paul, the same author, quotes the 5th Decalogue commandment as binding in Eph 6:2-3, within the same epistle.
- **Classification:** E053 (Continues) — the text specifies what was abolished using dogma vocabulary, and the same letter affirms a Decalogue commandment.

## Greek Vocabulary Patterns

### The Affirmation/Cessation Vocabulary Partition

Across 30 studies, a systematic vocabulary pattern emerged in the NT:

**Affirmation vocabulary (what continues):**
- entole (G1785) — "commandment" — 71 NT occurrences. Content-identified instances consistently refer to moral/Decalogue commandments. Never used in the NT for what was abolished (N097, N102).
- nomos (G3551) in affirmation contexts — "the law is holy" (Rom 7:12), "we establish the law" (Rom 3:31), "the law of liberty" (Jas 1:25), "the law of God" (Rom 7:22).

**Cessation vocabulary (what was abolished):**
- dogma (G1378) — "ordinance/decree" — used in Eph 2:15 and Col 2:14 for what was abolished. Never used for the Decalogue.
- cheirographon (G5498) — "handwriting" — Col 2:14 only. Means "hand-written," contrasting with God's finger-writing.
- dikaiomata sarkos — "carnal ordinances" — Heb 9:10 for tabernacle regulations.
- skia (G4639) — "shadow" — Heb 10:1, Col 2:17, Heb 8:5. Applied to ceremonial system. Never applied to the Decalogue.
- typos (G5179) / parabole (G3850) — "type/figure" — applied to the tabernacle (Acts 7:44; Heb 9:9).

**Key observation (N102, I122):** The NT vocabulary used in affirmation passages (entole unqualified, nomos in affirmation contexts) does not overlap with the vocabulary used in cessation passages (dogma, cheirographon, dikaiomata sarkos, skia). This partition is consistent across multiple authors (Paul, James, John, the author of Hebrews).

### entole (G1785) — The Moral Law Marker

- 71 NT occurrences across all major NT authors.
- When content is identified (43 instances), it is consistently moral/Decalogue: "Thou shalt not kill," "Thou shalt not commit adultery," "Honour thy father and mother," etc. (E463)
- In Revelation: "commandments of God" (entolas tou theou) in Rev 12:17, 14:12, 22:14.
- Paul distinguishes entole from circumcision in 1 Cor 7:19: "Circumcision is nothing...but the keeping of the commandments [entolai] of God."
- Hebrews uses entole for the priestly commandment (Heb 7:16, 18) — a specific ceremonial use — but this is always with a qualifier ("the law of a carnal commandment," "the commandment going before").
- **Pattern:** Entole without a qualifier is never used in the NT for ceremonial ordinances that were abolished (N097).

### nomos (G3551) — The Broad-Range Term

- 194 NT occurrences. Used in at least four distinct senses within Romans alone (N080):
  1. The Mosaic law (Torah) — Rom 2:12
  2. The Decalogue specifically — Rom 7:7 (quoting the 10th commandment)
  3. An operating principle — Rom 3:27 ("law of faith"), Rom 7:23 ("law of my mind")
  4. The OT Scriptures — Rom 3:19

- The articular/anarthrous pattern (ho nomos vs. nomos) does NOT reliably distinguish between moral and ceremonial law (N103). Exceptions exist in both directions.
- Nomos appears in both affirmation and cessation contexts, reflecting its broad semantic range. It is the referent of "law" in the ambiguous passages (Rom 10:4; Gal 3:24; etc.).

### dogma (G1378) — The Cessation Marker

- 5 NT occurrences. Two refer to the abolished ordinances (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14). Three refer to secular decrees (Luke 2:1; Acts 17:7) or apostolic decrees (Acts 16:4).
- Never used for the Decalogue or moral law.
- Paul uses dogma specifically for what was removed, and entole specifically for what remains — in the same epistles.

### cheirographon (G5498) — "Hand-Written Document"

- NT hapax legomenon (Col 2:14 only).
- The compound cheir (hand) + grapho (write) means "hand-written."
- The Decalogue was written by God's finger (Exo 31:18), not by human hand. The book of the law was written by Moses's hand (Deu 31:24). The cheirographon corresponds to the latter, not the former (N098).

#### I-B Items — Abolished Direction (22 items)

| ID | Statement (abbreviated) | Resolution | Key Counter-Evidence |
|----|------------------------|------------|---------------------|
| I012 | Gen 26:5 = personal commands only | Strong against (toward Continues) | Four covenant-vocabulary terms; pre-Sinai moral accountability |
| I018 | Decalogue distinctions = storage, not kind | Strong against | Five independent textual markers across multiple books |

#### I-B Items — Neutral Direction (7 items)

| ID | Statement (abbreviated) | Notes |
|----|------------------------|-------|
| I028 | Specific civil forms of Mosaic law ceased | Both sides agree |
| I029 | Civil and ceremonial overlap | Observation |
| I031 | Cheirographon = certificate of debt | Alternative reading |
| I032 | Jesus abolished lex talionis | Civil/ceremonial shared ground |
| I044 | Acts 15 demonstrates "law of Moses" was unified | Referent observation |
| I049 | Cheirographon = personal sin-debt certificate | Alternative reading |

### Resolution Pattern Analysis

Of the 22 I-B items classified Abolished:
- **All 22** were resolved Strong against (toward Continues) through the SIS protocol.
- The pattern: every Abolished I-B item has textual support from ambiguous passages, but the plain statements (Rom 3:31, 7:12; Mat 5:17-18; Heb 10:16; etc.) resolve the ambiguity in the Continues direction.

Of the 18 I-B items classified Continues:
- **14** were resolved Strong toward Continues.
- **4** were resolved Moderate toward Continues.
- **0** were unresolved.

**No I-B item in the evidence database is classified as "Unresolved."**

## Duplicate Check

A review of all 810 items in the evidence database was conducted for potential duplicates.

### Potential Overlaps Identified

1. **E053 and E054** both address cessation passages identifying ceremonial content, but they reference different verses (Eph 2:15 and Col 2:14 respectively) — not duplicates.

2. **E303/E304 and E038/E039** both address "my law" written on hearts, but E303/E304 specifically link the stone-medium to Deu 10:4 (identifying the Decalogue), while E038/E039 quote the base Jer 31:33 / Heb 8:10 text — complementary, not duplicates.

3. **E295 and E352** both quote 1 John 2:3-4, appearing in different studies. These are the same textual observation registered from different study entry points. **This is a potential duplicate** — both say "hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments." One could be merged, though both are correctly classified as Continues.

4. **E030 and E459** both address 1 John 5:3. E030 quotes the full verse; E459 adds the "not grievous" clause. These are overlapping but E459 adds distinct content.

5. **I103 and I109** both address "not under the law" = freedom from condemnation. I103 cites Rom 6:14/Gal 5:18; I109 cites only Gal 5:18 with Galatians-specific context. These are near-duplicates from different study contexts (law-16 vs. law-17).

6. **I158-I164** from law-28 do not have subtype indicators (I-A, I-B, etc.) in their IDs, though they function as I-A and I-B items based on their content.

### Summary

2-3 potential near-duplicates were identified (E295/E352; I103/I109). These do not materially affect the tally because they are both classified in the same direction (Continues). No duplicate items were found that would alter the positional balance.

## Patterns Across 30 Studies

### Pattern 1: No E-tier or N-tier Support for Abolition of the Moral Law

Across 513 E-items and 145 N-items (658 total), zero items support the abolition of the moral law (Decalogue/Sabbath). Every passage cited by the Abolished position either (a) uses vocabulary specifying ceremonial content, (b) has ambiguous referents resolved by SIS toward the Continues position, or (c) requires adding concepts the text does not contain (I-D).

### Pattern 2: The Vocabulary Partition Is Author-Independent

The entole/dogma partition is not limited to one author. Paul uses entole for what continues (1 Cor 7:19; Eph 6:2) and dogma for what was abolished (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14). John uses entole for the commandments of God (Rev 12:17; 14:12; 1 Jn 2:3-4; 5:3). James uses entole for the royal law (Jas 2:8-12). The author of Hebrews uses entole with a qualifier for the priestly commandment (Heb 7:16, 18) and dikaiomata sarkos for carnal ordinances (Heb 9:10).

### Pattern 3: NT Abolition Passages Self-Identify Their Object

Every NT passage that uses cessation language (abolished, nailed to cross, shadow, vanishing) specifies its object through vocabulary, grammar, or context:
- Col 2:14: cheirographon tois dogmasin (hand-written ordinances)
- Eph 2:15: ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin (the law of commandments in ordinances)
- Heb 7:12: entole with qualifier (the priestly commandment)
- Heb 8:13: specified by 9:1 as "ordinances of divine service"
- Heb 10:1-9: sacrifices and offerings
- 2 Cor 3:7-11: the glory/ministry (diakonia), not the law (nomos absent)
- Gal 3:24-25: the custodial function (paidagogos), not the content

None of these passages names the Decalogue, the Ten Commandments, or any specific moral commandment as its object of abolition (N043).

### Pattern 4: The Same Authors Who Describe Cessation Also Affirm Continuation

Paul abolishes "the law of commandments in ordinances" (Eph 2:15) and in the same letter affirms the 5th Decalogue commandment (Eph 6:2-3). Paul uses katargeo for the old-covenant glory (2 Cor 3:7) and explicitly denies making the law void (Rom 3:31) using the same verb. The author of Hebrews removes sacrifices (10:1-9) and writes God's laws on hearts (10:16) in the same argument.

### Pattern 5: The Abolished Position Depends Entirely on Inference

The evidence hierarchy is E > N > I. At the E and N tiers (658 items), the Continues position has 219 items (146 E + 73 N). The Abolished position has 0 items. At the I-tier, the Abolished position has 57 items (22 I-B + 1 I-C + 34 I-D). The Continues position has 82 I-tier items (63 I-A + 18 I-B + 1 I-C).

The Abolished position's strongest evidence type is I-B (competing-evidence inferences). But I-B items, by definition, have E/N items on both sides — and in every case, the SIS protocol resolved the tension toward the Continues direction.

The Abolished position's most numerous evidence type is I-D (counter-evidence external — 34 items). I-D items require overriding what the text says with concepts the text does not contain. This is the weakest category in the evidence hierarchy.
