## romans-10-4-telos — "What Does telos Mean in Romans 10:4?"

**Question:** What does telos (G5056) mean in Romans 10:4 — "For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth"? Does it mean termination, goal, or fulfillment?

**Summary Answer:** The biblical evidence strongly supports understanding telos as "goal" or "purpose" rather than "termination." The decisive evidence is 1 Timothy 1:5, where Paul uses the identical construction (telos + commandment) and the meaning is clearly "goal" — "the end (telos) of the commandment is love." Paul explicitly denies that faith makes the law void (Rom 3:31) and says the law was a "schoolmaster unto Christ" (Gal 3:24). Christ is where the law was always pointing; Israel missed salvation because they didn't recognize this.

**Key Findings:**
- 1 Tim 1:5 is the ONLY other place Paul uses telos with "commandment/law" — identical construction, clearly = goal/purpose
- Paul's other uses of telos (13 total) include outcome/result senses but context determines meaning
- Immediate context (Rom 10:1-11) shows Paul contrasts Israel's self-righteousness with faith-righteousness; the law ITSELF teaches faith-righteousness (Paul quotes Deut 30:12-14 in Rom 10:6-8)
- Rom 3:31 — Paul explicitly denies faith voids the law: "God forbid: yea, we establish the law"
- Rom 8:4 — the law's righteousness is fulfilled in Spirit-walkers
- The law was a "schoolmaster unto Christ" (Gal 3:24) — pointing TO Christ, not terminated BY Christ
- The law itself "witnessed" to the righteousness of God (Rom 3:21)

## gods-moral-law — "What is God's Moral Law?"

**Question:** What is God's moral law? What is its basis, nature, and scope?

**Summary Answer:** God's moral law is the Ten Commandments (the Decalogue), spoken by God's own voice and written by His own finger on two tables of stone (Exodus 20:1-17; 31:18; Deuteronomy 5:22). It is the expression of God's unchanging character in commandment form — perfect, holy, just, good, spiritual, and eternal (Psalm 19:7-9; Romans 7:12,14). It defines sin (1 John 3:4; Romans 7:7), applies to all humanity (Romans 2:14-15), existed before Sinai (Genesis 26:5), continues through the new covenant (Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:10), and will be kept by God's people at the end of time (Revelation 12:17; 14:12). Jesus summarized it in two principles of love (Matthew 22:36-40).

**Key Findings:**
- 7 unique markers distinguish the Decalogue from all other legislation: God's voice, God's finger, stone, inside the ark, "he added no more," called "the covenant," called "the testimony"
- The law's attributes mirror God's character: holy (Rom 7:12 / Lev 19:2), just (Rom 7:12 / Deu 32:4), good (Rom 7:12 / Psa 100:5), spiritual (Rom 7:14 / Jhn 4:24), perfect (Psa 19:7 / Mat 5:48), eternal (Psa 19:9 / Psa 90:2)
- The law defines sin (1 Jhn 3:4; Rom 7:7; Rom 3:20) but cannot save (Rom 3:20)
- Faith establishes the law (Rom 3:31); the Spirit enables law-keeping (Eze 36:27; Rom 8:4)
- Tally: 46 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items, 20 Neutral

## law-01-gods-moral-law — "What Is God's Moral Law? Basis, Nature, and Scope"

**Question:** What is God's moral law? Investigate the Decalogue's unique origin, its attributes that mirror God's character, and its universal/eternal scope.

**Summary Answer:** The Bible presents the Decalogue (Ten Commandments) as a distinct category of law, distinguished from all other legislation by seven unique markers: spoken by God's own voice, written by God's own finger, engraved on stone, placed inside the ark, completed with "he added no more," called "the covenant," and called "the testimony." The attributes the Bible ascribes to this law are the same attributes ascribed to God Himself. The law's scope extends before Sinai, beyond Israel, into the new covenant, and to the end of time.

**Key Findings:**
- Seven textual markers of distinction for the Decalogue (same as gods-moral-law above)
- Three independent channels attest moral law content: nature (Rom 1:19-20; Psa 19:1-4), conscience (Rom 2:14-15), and direct revelation (Decalogue itself). No channel attests ceremonial content.
- Cessation-vocabulary passages (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14) use dogma (G1378), never nomos or entole, for what was abolished
- I-B resolution (I6: cessation passages refer to ceremonial ordinances only): Moderate toward Continues — 8 Plain FOR items vs. 1 Contextually Clear and 3 Ambiguous AGAINST items
- Tally: 46 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items, 20 Neutral; 4 Continues N-items, 0 Abolished; 7 I-A Continues, 1 I-B resolved Moderate toward Continues, 1 I-C Neutral, 1 I-D Abolished

## law-07-law-of-moses — "What Does 'The Law of Moses' Refer To?"

**Question:** What does "the law of Moses" refer to — moral, ceremonial, or both? Classify all 21 law-code occurrences by identifiable content. Examine Paul's "law of God" vs "law of Moses" usage.

**Summary Answer:** The phrase "the law of Moses" in the KJV refers to the comprehensive body of Pentateuchal legislation — it is not restricted to any single category. OT bridging passages (Neh 8:1-9:3; 10:29; 2 Chr 34:14; Luke 2:22-24) demonstrate that "law of Moses," "law of God," and "law of the LORD" are interchangeable designations for the same document, describing it from different perspectives (human mediator vs. divine author). Paul's usage in Romans 7-8 vs. 1 Corinthians 9 shows a possible contextual distinction where "law of God" refers to the Decalogue specifically and "law of Moses" refers to the broader code.

**Key Findings:**
- "Law of Moses" appears 21 times as law-code reference; content spans ceremonial (7x), civil/judicial (3x), covenant curses (2x), literary/Pentateuch (2x), comprehensive (7x)
- No occurrence identifies exclusively Decalogue/moral content
- OT bridging passages show the same physical book called "law of Moses," "law of God," and "law of the LORD" (Neh 8:1, 8, 14, 18; Neh 10:29; 2 Chr 34:14)
- Paul's "law of God" in Romans 7:22, 25; 8:7 = the Decalogue (identified by "Thou shalt not covet" in 7:7)
- Paul's "law of Moses" in 1 Cor 9:9 cites a civil/agricultural regulation (Deu 25:4), not the Decalogue
- God Himself attributes "the law of Moses" to Moses as mediator ("my servant") while claiming authorship ("I commanded") in Mal 4:4

## law-14-jesus-law-teachings — "What Did Jesus Specifically Teach About the Law?"

**Question:** What did Jesus specifically teach about the law and commandments? Catalogue every instance. Did Jesus ever abolish any moral commandment?

**Summary Answer:** Across all four Gospels and John's epistles, Jesus consistently affirms, deepens, and defends the moral law (Decalogue). He directs the rich young ruler to the Decalogue as the path to life (Mat 19:17-19). He identifies the two love commandments as the organizing principle on which all the law hangs (Mat 22:37-40). His "new commandment" (Jhn 13:34) uses kainos (new in quality), and John clarifies it is simultaneously "an old commandment from the beginning" (1 Jhn 2:7). Jesus equates "my commandments" with "my Father's commandments" (Jhn 15:10). No passage in any Gospel records Jesus abolishing any Decalogue commandment.

**Key Findings:**
- Rich young ruler (Mat 19:17-19): Jesus names 5 specific Decalogue commandments (5th-9th) as the path to life
- Greatest commandment (Mat 22:37-40): love commands SUMMARIZE the law; "on these two commandments HANG all the law"
- "New commandment" (Jhn 13:34): kainos (G2537, new in quality) not neos (G3501, new in time); John calls it "old from the beginning" (1 Jhn 2:7)
- "My commandments" = "my Father's commandments" — same entole (G1785) vocabulary in same verse (Jhn 15:10)
- Anomia (G458, lawlessness) used by Jesus as eschatological disqualifier (Mat 7:23; 13:41); John defines sin = anomia (1 Jhn 3:4)
- Jesus affirms BOTH weightier AND lighter matters of law as obligatory (Mat 23:23)
- Antitheses (Mat 5:21-48) deepen Decalogue to heart-level; no commandment revoked
- Jesus calls 5th commandment "the commandment of God" (entolen tou Theou) in Mat 15:3; Mrk 7:8-13
- Tally: 17 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items, 7 Neutral; all Abolished claims are at inference level (3 I-D, 1 I-C)
- N075: In all four Gospels, no recorded instance of Jesus revoking any Decalogue commandment

## etc-03-biblical-death — "How Does the Bible Define Death?"

**Question:** How does the Bible define death? What is death's origin, nature, and cause according to Scripture?

**Summary Answer:** Scripture presents death as the consequence of sin (Gen 2:17; Rom 5:12; 6:23), the reversal of the creation formula of Genesis 2:7, and a state described as sleep from which resurrection is the awakening (Dan 12:2; John 11:11-14; 1 Cor 15:20,51; 1 Thess 4:13-16).

**Relevance to Law-16 Study:**
- "The wages of sin is death" (Rom 6:23) — sin-death-law connection central to Romans
- "The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law" (1 Cor 15:56) — law empowers sin's death-dealing
- "The law of sin and death" (Rom 8:2) — terminology examined in this study
- "To be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace" (Rom 8:6) — spiritual death language in Romans 8
- Rom 5:12-21 — death through Adam, life through Christ; sin-death-law interrelation
- Death entered through sin (Rom 5:12), not through the law — the law reveals sin but doesn't cause it (Rom 7:7, 12-13)
