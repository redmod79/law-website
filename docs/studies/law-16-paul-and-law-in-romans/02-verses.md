**Nomos occurrences in Rom 2:** vv.12(3x), 13(2x), 14(3x), 15, 17, 18, 20, 23(2x), 25(2x), 26, 27(2x) = ~17 occurrences. Paul discusses law in the context of Jew/Gentile judgment equality.

> **Romans 3:2** Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
> **Romans 3:3** For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
> **Romans 3:4** God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
> **Romans 3:5** But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Is] God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)
> **Romans 3:6** God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
> **Romans 3:7** For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
> **Romans 3:8** And not [rather], (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.
> **Romans 3:9** What then? are we better [than they]? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
> **Romans 3:10** As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
> **Romans 3:11** There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
> **Romans 3:12** They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
> **Romans 3:13** Their throat [is] an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps [is] under their lips:
> **Romans 3:14** Whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness:
> **Romans 3:15** Their feet [are] swift to shed blood:
> **Romans 3:16** Destruction and misery [are] in their ways:
> **Romans 3:17** And the way of peace have they not known:
> **Romans 3:18** There is no fear of God before their eyes.
> **Romans 3:19** Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
> **Romans 3:20** Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin.
> **Romans 3:21** But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
> **Romans 3:22** Even the righteousness of God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
> **Romans 3:23** For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
> **Romans 3:24** Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
> **Romans 3:25** Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
> **Romans 3:26** To declare, [I say], at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
> **Romans 3:27** Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.

**Nomos occurrences in Rom 3:** vv.19(2x), 20(2x), 21(2x), 27(3x — "law of works," "law of faith"), 28, 31(2x) = ~13 occurrences. Key verse: 3:31 — faith ESTABLISHES the law.

### Romans 4:1-25 (Full Chapter — Abraham's Faith and Law)

> **Romans 4:1** What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
> **Romans 4:2** For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath [whereof] to glory; but not before God.
> **Romans 4:3** For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
> **Romans 4:4** Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
> **Romans 4:5** But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
> **Romans 4:6** Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
> **Romans 4:7** [Saying], Blessed [are] they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
> **Romans 4:8** Blessed [is] the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
> **Romans 4:9** [Cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision [only], or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
> **Romans 4:10** How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
> **Romans 4:11** And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:
> **Romans 4:12** And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised.
> **Romans 4:13** For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
> **Romans 4:14** For if they which are of the law [be] heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
> **Romans 4:15** Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, [there is] no transgression.
> **Romans 4:16** Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
> **Romans 4:17-25** [Abraham's faith exemplified — believed against hope; delivered for our offences, raised for our justification]

### Romans 5:1-21 (Full Chapter — Context for Law/Sin/Grace)

> **Romans 5:1** Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
> **Romans 5:2** By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
> **Romans 5:12** Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
> **Romans 5:13** (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
> **Romans 5:14** Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
> **Romans 5:15** But not as the offence, so also [is] the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, [which is] by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
> **Romans 5:16** And not as [it was] by one that sinned, [so is] the gift: for the judgment [was] by one to condemnation, but the free gift [is] of many offences unto justification.
> **Romans 5:17** For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)
> **Romans 5:18** Therefore as by the offence of one [judgment came] upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one [the free gift came] upon all men unto justification of life.
> **Romans 5:19** For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
> **Romans 5:20** Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
> **Romans 5:21** That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

**Key: Romans 5:13** — sin was in the world before the Sinai law; 5:20 — "the law entered, that the offence might abound."

### Romans 6:1-23 (Full Chapter — "Not Under Law But Under Grace")

> **Romans 6:1** What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
> **Romans 6:2** God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
> **Romans 6:3** Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
> **Romans 6:4** Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
> **Romans 6:5** For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also [in the likeness] of [his] resurrection:
> **Romans 6:6** Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
> **Romans 6:7** For he that is dead is freed from sin.
> **Romans 6:8** Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:
> **Romans 6:9** Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
> **Romans 6:10** For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
> **Romans 6:11** Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
> **Romans 6:12** Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
> **Romans 6:13** Neither yield ye your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God.
> **Romans 6:14** For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
> **Romans 6:15** What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
> **Romans 6:16** Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
> **Romans 6:17** But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
> **Romans 6:18** Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
> **Romans 6:19** I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
> **Romans 6:20** For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
> **Romans 6:21** What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things [is] death.
> **Romans 6:22** But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
> **Romans 6:23** For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

**Nomos in Rom 6:** vv.14, 15 only (2 occurrences). "Not under the law" contrasted with "under grace." Key: Paul immediately asks "shall we sin?" (v.15) and answers "God forbid" — being "not under law" does NOT mean sin is permissible.

### Romans 7:1-25 (Full Chapter — The Inner Man and the Law)

> **Romans 7:1** Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?
> **Romans 7:2** For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to [her] husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of [her] husband.
> **Romans 7:3** So then if, while [her] husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.
> **Romans 7:4** Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, [even] to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
> **Romans 7:5** For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
> **Romans 7:6** But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not [in] the oldness of the letter.
> **Romans 7:7** What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
> **Romans 7:8** But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin [was] dead.
> **Romans 7:9** For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
> **Romans 7:10** And the commandment, which [was ordained] to life, I found [to be] unto death.
> **Romans 7:11** For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me].
> **Romans 7:12** Wherefore the law [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
> **Romans 7:13** Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
> **Romans 7:14** For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
> **Romans 7:15** For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
> **Romans 7:16** If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that [it is] good.
> **Romans 7:17** Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
> **Romans 7:18** For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but [how] to perform that which is good I find not.
> **Romans 7:19** For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
> **Romans 7:20** Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
> **Romans 7:21** I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.
> **Romans 7:22** For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
> **Romans 7:23** But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
> **Romans 7:24** O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
> **Romans 7:25** I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.

**Nomos occurrences in Rom 7:** vv.1(2x), 2(2x), 3, 4, 5, 6, 7(3x), 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, 21, 22, 23(4x — "law in my members," "law of my mind," "law of sin"), 25(2x — "law of God," "law of sin") = ~25 occurrences. Multiple senses of nomos used in one chapter.

**Key identifications in Rom 7:**
- v.7: "Thou shalt not covet" = 10th commandment (Exo 20:17) — Paul identifies nomos with Decalogue
- v.12: law is "holy, just, and good"
- v.14: law is "spiritual"
- v.22: Paul "delights in the law of God after the inward man"
- v.25: "with the mind I myself serve the law of God"
- "Law of God" in v.22, 25 = Decalogue (per law-07 study)

### Romans 8:1-14 (Spirit, Law, and Righteousness)

> **Romans 8:1** [There is] therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
> **Romans 8:2** For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
> **Romans 8:3** For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
> **Romans 8:4** That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
> **Romans 8:5** For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
> **Romans 8:6** For to be carnally minded [is] death; but to be spiritually minded [is] life and peace.
> **Romans 8:7** Because the carnal mind [is] enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
> **Romans 8:8** So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
> **Romans 8:9** But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
> **Romans 8:10** And if Christ [be] in you, the body [is] dead because of sin; but the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness.
> **Romans 8:11** But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
> **Romans 8:12** Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
> **Romans 8:13** For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
> **Romans 8:14** For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

**Nomos in Rom 8:** vv.2(2x — "law of the Spirit of life," "law of sin and death"), 3, 4, 7 = 5 occurrences.

**Key:** v.4 — "the righteousness (dikaioma) of the law might be fulfilled in us" — the Spirit enables law-fulfillment, not law-abolition.
**Key:** v.7 — "the carnal mind is...not subject to the law of God" — the law of God remains the standard; the problem is the carnal mind, not the law.

### Romans 9:30-10:13 (Christ the Telos of the Law)

> **Romans 9:30** What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.
> **Romans 9:31** But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
> **Romans 9:32** Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
> **Romans 9:33** As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.

> **Romans 10:1** Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.
> **Romans 10:2** For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
> **Romans 10:3** For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
> **Romans 10:4** For Christ [is] the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
> **Romans 10:5** For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.
> **Romans 10:6** But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down [from above]:)
> **Romans 10:7** Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)
> **Romans 10:8** But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, [even] in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;
> **Romans 10:9** That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
> **Romans 10:10** For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
> **Romans 10:11** For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
> **Romans 10:12** For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
> **Romans 10:13** For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

**Key:** v.4 — telos (G5056) = goal/purpose (per romans-10-4-telos study); vv.6-8 quote Deut 30:12-14 — the LAW ITSELF teaches faith-righteousness.

### Romans 13:1-14 (Full Chapter Context for 13:8-10)

> **Romans 13:1** Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
> **Romans 13:2** Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
> **Romans 13:3** For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:
> **Romans 13:4** For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to [execute] wrath upon him that doeth evil.
> **Romans 13:5** Wherefore [ye] must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
> **Romans 13:6** For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.
> **Romans 13:7** Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute [is due]; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
> **Romans 13:8** Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
> **Romans 13:9** For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if [there be] any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
> **Romans 13:10** Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law.
> **Romans 13:11** And that, knowing the time, that now [it is] high time to awake out of sleep: for now [is] our salvation nearer than when we believed.
> **Romans 13:12** The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
> **Romans 13:13** Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.
> **Romans 13:14** But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to [fulfil] the lusts [thereof].

**Key:** v.9 explicitly quotes 4 Decalogue commandments: adultery (7th), murder (6th), theft (8th), false witness (9th), covet (10th). Paul says "if there be any other commandment" — acknowledging more commandments exist. These are "briefly comprehended" in love.

## Cross-Reference Passages

### Jeremiah 31:31-34 (New Covenant Promise — Law on Hearts)

> **Jeremiah 31:31** Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
> **Jeremiah 31:32** Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day [that] I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:
> **Jeremiah 31:33** But this [shall be] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
> **Jeremiah 31:34** And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.

**Connection to Romans 2:14-15:** Gentiles with "the work of the law written in their hearts" parallels "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts."

### Hebrews 8:1-13 (New Covenant Quoted — Same Law, New Location)

> **Hebrews 8:6** But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
> **Hebrews 8:7** For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
> **Hebrews 8:8** For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
> **Hebrews 8:9** Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
> **Hebrews 8:10** For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
> **Hebrews 8:11** And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
> **Hebrews 8:12** For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
> **Hebrews 8:13** In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old [is] ready to vanish away.

**Key:** v.8 — "finding fault with THEM" (the people), not with the law. v.10 — "I will put MY laws into their mind" — possessive pronoun "my" indicates pre-existing law (per law-10 study).

### 1 Timothy 1:5-11 (Telos Parallel — Law Is Good)

> **1 Timothy 1:5** Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned:
> **1 Timothy 1:6** From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
> **1 Timothy 1:7** Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
> **1 Timothy 1:8** But we know that the law [is] good, if a man use it lawfully;
> **1 Timothy 1:9** Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
> **1 Timothy 1:10** For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
> **1 Timothy 1:11** According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

**Key:** v.5 — "the end (telos, G5056) of the commandment is charity" — identical construction to Rom 10:4. Telos here clearly = goal/purpose, not termination. v.8 — "the law is good, if a man use it lawfully." vv.9-10 list moral sins corresponding to Decalogue commandments.

### Galatians 2:14-21 (Justified by Faith, Not Works of Law)

> **Galatians 2:14** But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before [them] all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
> **Galatians 2:16** Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
> **Galatians 2:17** But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, [is] therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.
> **Galatians 2:19** For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.
> **Galatians 2:20** I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
> **Galatians 2:21** I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness [come] by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

### Galatians 3:19-25 (Law as Schoolmaster)

> **Galatians 3:19** Wherefore then [serveth] the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
> **Galatians 3:21** [Is] the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.
> **Galatians 3:22** But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
> **Galatians 3:23** But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
> **Galatians 3:24** Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
> **Galatians 3:25** But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

**Key:** v.24 — law was schoolmaster "unto Christ" (eis Christon) — pointing TO Christ, not ending AT Christ.

### Galatians 5:13-25 (Spirit vs Flesh — Law Fulfilled in Love)

> **Galatians 5:13** For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only [use] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
> **Galatians 5:14** For all the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
> **Galatians 5:16** [This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
> **Galatians 5:17** For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
> **Galatians 5:18** But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
> **Galatians 5:22** But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
> **Galatians 5:23** Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

**Key:** v.14 parallels Rom 13:8-10. v.18 — "led by the Spirit...not under the law" parallels Rom 6:14. v.23 — "against such there is no law" — Spirit-fruit does not violate the law.

### 2 Corinthians 3:1-18 (Ministry of Spirit vs Letter)

> **2 Corinthians 3:3** [Forasmuch as ye are] manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
> **2 Corinthians 3:6** Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
> **2 Corinthians 3:7** But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away:
> **2 Corinthians 3:9** For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
> **2 Corinthians 3:17** Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.

**Key:** v.7 — "ministration of death, written and engraven in stones" refers to the MINISTRY (diakonia) being done away, not the law itself. The glory of Moses' face (administration) is what faded, while the content (law) is written on hearts by the Spirit (v.3).

### Deuteronomy 30:6-14 (Source of Paul's Quotation in Rom 10:6-8)

> **Deuteronomy 30:6** And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.
> **Deuteronomy 30:11** For this commandment which I command thee this day, it [is] not hidden from thee, neither [is] it far off.
> **Deuteronomy 30:12** It [is] not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?
> **Deuteronomy 30:13** Neither [is] it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?
> **Deuteronomy 30:14** But the word [is] very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.

**Key:** Paul quotes this passage in Rom 10:6-8 and says THIS is "the righteousness which is of faith" speaking. The LAW ITSELF teaches faith-righteousness (the word near, in mouth and heart).

### Exodus 20:1-17 (The Ten Commandments — The Law Paul Identifies)

> **Exodus 20:1-2** And God spake all these words, saying, I [am] the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
> **Exodus 20:3** Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
> **Exodus 20:7** Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain...
> **Exodus 20:8** Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
> **Exodus 20:12** Honour thy father and thy mother...
> **Exodus 20:13** Thou shalt not kill.
> **Exodus 20:14** Thou shalt not commit adultery.
> **Exodus 20:15** Thou shalt not steal.
> **Exodus 20:16** Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
> **Exodus 20:17** Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife...

**Key:** Rom 7:7 quotes the 10th commandment ("thou shalt not covet"). Rom 13:9 quotes commandments 7, 6, 8, 9, 10. These are Decalogue commandments — Paul identifies nomos with the Ten Commandments.
