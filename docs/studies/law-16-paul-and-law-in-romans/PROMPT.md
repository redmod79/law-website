# Bible Study: What Does Paul Teach About the Law in Romans?

## Question
What does Paul teach about the law in Romans? Examine Romans 2:12-16, 3:19-31, 6:14-15, 7:1-25, 8:1-4, 10:4, and 13:8-10. What is Paul's understanding of the law's nature, function, and ongoing role (if any) for the believer? How do these passages relate to the Continues/Abolished question for the moral law (Ten Commandments)?

## Law Series Context

This is study #16 in the "Law of God" series. The analysis agent MUST read and follow:
- **Methodology file:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-series-methodology.md` (contains the Continues/Abolished framework, evidence classification system, positional tally rules, I-B resolution protocol, and verification phase)
- **Master evidence file:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-master-evidence.md` (tracks all evidence across the series to avoid duplication; the analysis agent must check for existing items and only add NEW evidence)

### Prior Study Findings (15 studies completed)
1. **law-01 (God's Moral Law):** Decalogue has 7 unique markers distinguishing it from all other law; attributes mirror God's character. 46 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished.
2. **law-02 (Law Before Sinai):** 6 categories of pre-Sinai moral evidence; moral law preceded Sinai. 6 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished.
3. **law-03 (Exodus 20 vs Later Laws):** 5 dimensions of distinction (delivery, authorship, repository, naming, boundary) between Decalogue and subsequent legislation. 11 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished.
4. **law-04 (Ceremonial Laws):** 5 categories of ceremonial law; shadow/type vocabulary exclusively ceremonial. 6 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished.
5. **law-05 (Civil/Judicial Laws):** Mishpatim as case-law applications of Decalogue principles. 1 Continues E-item, 0 Abolished.
6. **law-06 (Hebrew Law Vocabulary):** Torah, mitsvah, choq, mishpat, edut, piqqud, chuqqah — terms describe formal character, not moral category. Eduth exclusively associated with Decalogue tablets.
7. **law-07 (Law of Moses):** "Law of Moses" is comprehensive, not restricted to one category. Paul's "law of God" in Rom 7 = Decalogue; "law of Moses" in 1 Cor 9 = broader code.
8. **law-08 (Abolished at Cross):** 7 abolition passages examined; none names Decalogue. Dogma (G1378) never used for Decalogue. Cheirographon = "hand-written" (Decalogue was God-written).
9. **law-09 (Old Covenant/New Covenant):** Old covenant weakness was the people, not the law. Same law, different administration. Five differences between covenants.
10. **law-10 (New Covenant and Law):** New covenant writes same law on hearts. Possessive pronouns "MY law/laws/statutes" identify pre-existing law.
11. **law-11 (Written on Hearts):** Four convergent textual markers identify the law written on hearts as the Decalogue. Berith-Decalogue equation, kathab/grapho verb connection, stone-to-heart contrast.
12. **law-12 (Matthew 5:17-20):** Kataluo = demolish/annul; pleroo = fill full. Permanence tied to cosmos. Antitheses deepen, not revoke.
13. **law-13 (Jesus and Sabbath):** Every controversy within legal framework (exesti). Eiothos = settled custom. "Lord of the Sabbath" = governing authority.
14. **law-14 (Jesus Law Teachings):** Jesus consistently affirms moral law. No passage records Jesus abolishing any Decalogue commandment.
15. **law-15 (Acts 15 Jerusalem Council):** Council addressed circumcision/ceremonial requirement. v.21 assumes ongoing Sabbath instruction. "We're Gentiles" objection addressed by incorporation into Israel.

- **romans-10-4-telos:** Analyzed [G5056](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5056/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (telos) in Romans 10:4. Concluded telos = "goal/purpose" (not termination), based on 1 Tim 1:5 parallel (identical construction, clearly = goal). Paul denies faith voids law (Rom 3:31). The law was schoolmaster unto Christ (Gal 3:24). The law itself testified to faith-righteousness (Rom 3:21; Deut 30:12-14 quoted in Rom 10:6-8).

**Key findings from related studies:**
- **telos in Rom 10:4 = goal/purpose** (not termination), per the identical construction in 1 Tim 1:5 where telos + commandment clearly = goal. Paul explicitly denies faith voids law (Rom 3:31) and says law was schoolmaster unto Christ (Gal 3:24).
- **"Law of God" in Rom 7 = Decalogue** per law-07 study analysis. Paul uses "law of God" distinctly from "law of Moses."
- **Abolition passages (law-08) never name Decalogue.** The terms used (dogma, cheirographon) are never associated with the Ten Commandments.
- **New covenant writes SAME law on hearts (law-10, law-11)** — the law in Rom 2:14-15 (Gentiles with law written on hearts) connects to Jer 31:33 and the Decalogue.

### Focus Areas

The following focus areas are derived from the tool discoveries above:

1. **Romans 2:12-16 — Law written on Gentile hearts**
   - Nave's CONSCIENCE topic (0.59 score) lists ROM 2:14,15 as a key verse
   - Nave's GENTILES topic lists ROM 2:1-15
   - Connection to new covenant promise (Jer 31:33) — law-10 and law-11 established that the law written on hearts = Decalogue
   - [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (nomos) — which law do Gentiles have "by nature"?

2. **Romans 3:19-31 — Justification and law**
   - Nave's JUSTIFICATION topic lists ROM 3:21,22,24-26,28,30 extensively
   - [G1343](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1343/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dikaiosyne) — "righteousness of God without the law" (3:21) yet "witnessed by the law" (3:21)
   - ROM 3:31 — "Do we make void the law through faith? God forbid: we establish the law"
   - [G1345](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1345/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dikaioma) — "ordinance" / "righteousness" usage in Romans

3. **Romans 6:14-15 — "Not under law but under grace"**
   - Nave's GRACE OF GOD topic (0.47) lists ROM 5:2,6-8,15-21
   - Nave's SIN topic lists ROM 6 in Paul's discussion of responsibility
   - What does "not under law" mean? Jurisdiction? Condemnation? Method of justification?

4. **Romans 7:1-25 — The inner man and the law**
   - Nave's LAW topic lists ROM 7:7,12,14 under general scriptures
   - Nave's CONSCIENCE topic lists ROM 7:15-22,23
   - Nave's SIN topic lists ROM 7:5,7,13 (sinfulness revealed by law; sin repugnant to righteous)
   - ROM 7:12 — "the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good"
   - ROM 7:14 — "the law is spiritual"
   - ROM 7:22 — "I delight in the law of God after the inward man"
   - ROM 7:25 — "with the mind I myself serve the law of God"
   - [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (entole) — "commandment" in Rom 7:8-13
   - law-07 finding: "law of God" in Rom 7 = Decalogue

5. **Romans 8:1-4 — The Spirit and the law's righteousness**
   - Nave's HOLY SPIRIT topic (0.52) — Spirit's role in relation to law
   - ROM 8:2 — "law of the Spirit of life" vs "law of sin and death"
   - ROM 8:4 — "the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us"
   - [G1345](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1345/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dikaioma) — "righteousness/ordinance" of the law fulfilled in Spirit-walkers
   - Does the Spirit enable law-keeping or replace the law?

6. **Romans 10:4 — Christ the "telos" of the law**
   - [G5056](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5056/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (telos) — goal/purpose vs termination
   - Prior study (romans-10-4-telos) concluded = goal, based on 1 Tim 1:5 parallel
   - Nave's LAW "Temporary" section lists ROM 10:4 — but also lists passages the series has analyzed otherwise
   - ROM 10:5-8 quotes Deuteronomy 30:12-14 — the LAW ITSELF teaches faith-righteousness

7. **Romans 13:8-10 — Love as law fulfillment**
   - Nave's COMMANDMENTS topic lists ROM 13:8-14 under "Precepts of Paul"
   - ROM 13:9 explicitly quotes four Decalogue commandments (adultery, murder, theft, false witness/covet) and says they are "briefly comprehended" in "love thy neighbour"
   - [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (entole) — "commandment" in 13:9
   - Does "love is the fulfilling of the law" mean love replaces the law or that love is expressed through law-keeping?

8. **The nomos semantic range in Romans**
   - [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (nomos) appears ~74 times in Romans — more than any other NT book
   - Paul uses nomos in multiple senses: Mosaic law, principle/pattern, Torah as Scripture, specific commandments
   - Tracking which sense Paul intends in each passage is critical for accurate analysis
   - law-06 (Hebrew vocabulary) and law-07 (law of Moses) provide framework for this

9. **Relationship between justification and sanctification**
   - [G1347](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1347/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dikaiosis) — justification (Rom 4:25; 5:18)
   - [G1343](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1343/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dikaiosyne) — righteousness throughout Romans
   - How does Paul distinguish between the law's role in justification (not by works of law) and its role in sanctification (walking after the Spirit fulfills the law's righteousness)?

10. **The Nave's LAW "Temporary" classification**
    - Nave's lists ROM 7:1-6, 8:3, 10:4 under "Temporary" alongside COL 2:14-23, EPH 2:15, HEB 8:4-13
    - The research agent should investigate whether these Romans passages teach temporariness of the moral law or of a specific law-function (condemnation, justification-by-works, ceremonial system)

### Special Research Notes
- For Rom 7, investigate the "law of God" (nomos tou theou) vs "law of sin" (nomos tes hamartias) distinction — law-07 concluded "law of God" in Rom 7 = Decalogue
- For Rom 8:4, investigate dikaioma (G1345) — is this "the righteous requirement" (singular) of the law? How is it fulfilled "in us"?
- For Rom 10:4, incorporate the existing telos study findings but also gather fresh verse text and context
- For Rom 13:9, note which specific Decalogue commands Paul quotes — this is significant for identifying which law Paul means by "nomos"
- Track every occurrence of nomos in the target passages and note which sense Paul uses in each
