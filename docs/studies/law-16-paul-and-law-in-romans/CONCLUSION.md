# What Does Paul Teach About the Law in Romans?

## Question
What does Paul teach about the law in Romans? Conduct a systematic examination of every major law passage in Romans: Rom 2:12-16, 3:19-31, 6:14-15, 7:1-25, 8:1-4, 10:4, and 13:8-10. In each passage, determine which "law" Paul means by examining the immediate context.

## Summary Answer
Paul teaches in Romans that the moral law (identified with the Decalogue by direct quotation) is holy, just, good, and spiritual; that it defines sin, reveals God's character, and remains the standard of righteousness for believers. The law cannot justify (3:20), but faith establishes rather than abolishes it (3:31). Believers are freed from the law's condemning power ("not under the law," 6:14) so that the Holy Spirit can fulfill the law's righteous requirement in them (8:4). Christ is the goal (telos) toward which the law pointed (10:4), and love fulfills the specific Decalogue commandments Paul quotes (13:8-10).

## Key Verses

**Romans 3:31** — "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."

**Romans 7:7, 12** — "I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. ... Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."

**Romans 7:14, 22** — "We know that the law is spiritual. ... For I delight in the law of God after the inward man."

**Romans 8:3-4** — "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son ... condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."

**Romans 10:4** — "For Christ is the end [telos/goal] of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."

**Romans 13:8-10** — "He that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."

### Explicit Statements (E-items)

*Tree 1 applied: Each item directly quotes or closely paraphrases actual verse text. Tree 3 applied for positional classification.*

**New items from this study:**

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Position | Tree 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E389 | Paul states: "Not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified." Doing the law is the criterion of justification in the judgment context. | Rom 2:13 | Continues | V1: law-continuation vocabulary (doers of law = justified). Gate 1: PASS — "the law" in context of Rom 2:12-27 includes moral content (vv.21-22 cite steal, adultery, idols = Decalogue). Gate 2: PASS — grammar unambiguous. Gate 3: PASS — didactic epistle. Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E025 (faith establishes law), E026 (dikaioma fulfilled in us). |
| E390 | Paul states: "When the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness." Gentiles possess the law's moral content internally. | Rom 2:14-15 | Continues | V1: law-continuation vocabulary (law written in hearts — echoes Jer 31:33). Gate 1: PASS — "the things contained in the law" in context refers to moral commands (vv.21-22 identify stealing, adultery, idolatry). Gate 2: PASS — grapton en tais kardiais unambiguous. Gate 3: PASS — didactic. Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E038/E039 (new covenant writes law on hearts). |
| E391 | Paul states: "By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin." The law cannot justify but gives knowledge of sin. | Rom 3:20 | Neutral | V1: No — states law's diagnostic function, not continuation or cessation vocabulary specifically. V2: No. Both NO = Neutral. Both sides accept that the law gives knowledge of sin and cannot justify. |
| E392 | Paul states: "The righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets." Righteousness by faith is apart from law-works but witnessed BY the law itself. | Rom 3:21 | Continues | V1: The law witnesses to faith-righteousness — the law testifies positively to the gospel. Gate 1: PASS — "the law" here = the Torah as Scripture/witness, which testifies to the moral standard. Gate 2: PASS — grammar clear: martyroumene hypo tou nomou. Gate 3: PASS — didactic. Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E025 (establish law), E026 (dikaioma fulfilled). |
| E393 | Paul uses two principles: "law of works" (nomos ergon) vs. "law of faith" (nomos pisteos). Nomos here means "operating principle," not Torah. Boasting is excluded by the principle of faith. | Rom 3:27 | Neutral | V1: No — vocabulary observation about nomos semantic range. V2: No. Both NO = Neutral. |
| E394 | Paul states: "Sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace." Being "not under the law" is the reason sin does NOT dominate — connected to freedom from condemnation, not freedom from moral obligation. | Rom 6:14 | Neutral | V1: No — does not use explicit continuation vocabulary. V2: Candidate — "not under the law" is cessation-adjacent vocabulary. Gate 1: FAIL — "the law" referent is ambiguous. "Under the law" (hypo nomon) could mean (a) under the law's condemning power or (b) under the law's authority entirely. The immediate context (v.15: "shall we sin? God forbid!") and Rom 8:1 ("no condemnation") support reading (a). Reclassification: RC1: Referent of "under the law" is ambiguous. RC2: Corrected: "Not under the law's condemnation but under grace." RC3: Neither continuation nor cessation vocabulary applies to condemnation status. Neutral. |
| E395 | Paul states: "What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid." Paul denies that "not under the law" permits sin. Me genoito = strongest possible negation. | Rom 6:15 | Continues | V1: Paul's denial that "not under law" permits sinning is law-continuation vocabulary — if the moral law were abolished, sin (defined as law-transgression, 1 Jn 3:4) would be meaningless. Gate 1: PASS — "sin" (hamartia) presupposes a law to transgress. Gate 2: PASS — grammar clear: deliberative subjunctive answered by me genoito. Gate 3: PASS — didactic. Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E023 (sin is law-transgression), E025 (establish law). |
| E396 | Paul states: "Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." Paul quotes the 10th commandment (Exo 20:17), identifying nomos with the Decalogue. | Rom 7:7 | Continues | V1: The law reveals sin; Paul identifies it as the Decalogue by quoting the 10th commandment. Gate 1: PASS — referent explicitly identified as Decalogue (10th commandment quoted). Gate 2: PASS — elegen (Imperfect) = law "was saying" (ongoing). Gate 3: PASS — didactic. Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E010 (law holy/just/good), E046 (identical verse previously registered as E046). NOTE: E046 already covers this verse. This item extends E046 by noting the Imperfect tense. |
| E397 | Paul states: "Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence." The commandment (entole) is the occasion; sin is the active agent. The commandment itself is not sinful. | Rom 7:8, 11 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO = Neutral. Both sides accept that sin uses the commandment as an occasion. |
| E398 | Paul states: "The commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death." The commandment's intended purpose was life; sin perverted its effect. | Rom 7:10 | Neutral | V1: "ordained to life" could indicate continuation, but it describes original purpose, not present status. V2: No. Neutral — both sides accept the commandment was given for life. |
| E399 | Paul states: "I delight in the law of God after the inward man." Present tense synedomai = ongoing delight. "The law of God" (nomos tou theou) in this context = the Decalogue (identified in v.7). | Rom 7:22 | Continues | V1: "delight in the law of God" = law-continuation vocabulary (echoes Psa 1:2; 119:97). Gate 1: PASS — "the law of God" identified as Decalogue by v.7. Gate 2: PASS — present tense = ongoing reality. Gate 3: PASS — didactic. Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E010-E011, E046. |
| E400 | Paul states: "With the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin." Paul's mind serves God's law; his flesh serves sin's principle. Two allegiances in present tense. | Rom 7:25 | Continues | V1: "serve the law of God" = law-continuation vocabulary. Gate 1: PASS — "the law of God" = Decalogue (v.7 context). Gate 2: PASS — present tense douleuo. Gate 3: PASS — didactic. Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E010-E011, E399. |
| E401 | Paul states: "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death." Two principles: Spirit's life-giving principle frees from sin's death-dealing principle. Nomos = operating principle in both cases. | Rom 8:2 | Neutral | V1: No — "law" here means "principle," not Torah. V2: No. Both NO = Neutral. |
| E402 | Paul states: "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh." The law's limitation is in THE FLESH, not in the law. | Rom 8:3 | Neutral | V1: No — states the law's inability through the flesh. Both sides accept the law could not justify through fallen human nature. V2: No. Neutral. NOTE: Already registered as E062. This study adds law-16 to "Also In." |
| E403 | Paul states: "That the righteousness [dikaioma] of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." The purpose of Christ's coming is that the law's dikaioma be fulfilled IN believers (en hemin). Singular dikaioma with article = "THE righteous requirement." | Rom 8:4 | Continues | V1: "righteousness of the law fulfilled in us" = law-continuation vocabulary. Gate 1: PASS — "the law" (tou nomou) in context = moral law (8:7 "law of God"; 7:7 quotes Decalogue). Gate 2: PASS — hina + plerothe = purpose clause; en hemin = in us; dikaioma singular. Gate 3: PASS — didactic. Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E010-E011, E025, E026 (identical to E026). NOTE: E026 already covers this verse. This study adds law-16 to "Also In." |
| E404 | Paul states: "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." The "law of God" is the standard to which minds should be subject. The carnal mind's inability is the problem, not the law. | Rom 8:7 | Continues | V1: "law of God" as the standard of subjection = law-continuation vocabulary. Gate 1: PASS — "the law of God" (tou nomou tou theou) = Decalogue (same phrase as 7:22, 25). Gate 2: PASS — ou hypotassetai = is not subject (present tense). Gate 3: PASS — didactic. Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E010-E011, E399-E400. NOTE: E027 already covers this verse. This study adds law-16 to "Also In." |
| E405 | Paul states: "Christ is the end [telos] of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth." Telos (G5056) can mean "termination" or "goal/purpose." | Rom 10:4 | Neutral | V1: No — if telos = goal, this is continuation vocabulary. V2: Yes — if telos = termination, this is cessation vocabulary. Both V1 and V2 YES. Gate 1: FAIL — telos has a semantic range that allows either "termination" or "goal." The referent sense is ambiguous on this verse alone. Reclassification: RC1: telos meaning is ambiguous between termination and goal. RC2: The word telos has a range of meaning. RC3: Neither applies with certainty from this verse alone. Neutral. NOTE: E061 already covers this verse. This study adds law-16 to "Also In." |
| E406 | Paul quotes Deut 30:12-14 and identifies it as "the righteousness which is of faith" speaking. The Torah itself teaches faith-righteousness: "The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach." | Rom 10:6-8 | Continues | V1: The law itself witnesses to faith-righteousness — the law and faith are complementary. Gate 1: PASS — Paul identifies his source as Deut 30:12-14. Gate 2: PASS — Paul's hermeneutical application is explicit. Gate 3: PASS — didactic. Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E392 (law witnesses to righteousness), E025 (establish law). |
| E407 | Paul quotes five Decalogue commandments as the content love fulfills: "Thou shalt not commit adultery [7th], Thou shalt not kill [6th], Thou shalt not steal [8th], Thou shalt not bear false witness [9th], Thou shalt not covet [10th]; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." | Rom 13:9 | Continues | V1: Direct citation of Decalogue commands as the operative moral standard. Gate 1: PASS — five Decalogue commandments explicitly named. Gate 2: PASS — anakephalaioatai (present passive) = "is comprehended." Gate 3: PASS — didactic. Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E028 (identical verse already registered). NOTE: E028 already covers this verse. This study adds law-16 to "Also In." |
| E408 | Paul states: "Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling [pleroma] of the law." Love = the fullness (pleroma, [G4138](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4138/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} — noun) of the law. Love fills the law; the law remains as the container. | Rom 13:10 | Continues | V1: "love is the fulfilling of the law" = law-continuation vocabulary. Love fulfills the law; the law is not abolished. Gate 1: PASS — "the law" in context = Decalogue (five commandments just quoted in v.9). Gate 2: PASS — pleroma = fullness/filling, not termination. Gate 3: PASS — didactic. Gate 4: PASS — consistent with E025, E028, E318 (Gal 5:14). |

### Necessary Implications (N-items)

*Tree 1 N-CHECK applied. Tree 4 Gate 0 applied. All three N-tier tests passed for each item.*

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Why unavoidable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N080 | Paul uses nomos in at least four distinct senses within Romans: (1) the Mosaic Torah/code, (2) the moral law/Decalogue specifically, (3) an operating principle/pattern, (4) the Pentateuch as Scripture-witness. This is observable from the contexts where Paul identifies the referent. | E046/E396 (Decalogue quoted), E393 (nomos = principle), E392 (nomos = witness), E391 (nomos = Torah diagnostic) | Neutral | Both sides must acknowledge Paul uses nomos in multiple senses. The word's referent changes by context. Observable grammatical fact. |
| N081 | When Paul specifies the content of "the law" by direct quotation, the content is always Decalogue commandments: the 10th commandment in Rom 7:7, and the 6th-10th commandments in Rom 13:9. Paul never identifies nomos with ceremonial law when quoting specific content in Romans. | E046/E396 (Rom 7:7), E028/E407 (Rom 13:9) | Continues | Observable fact: every direct quotation of law-content in Romans is from the Decalogue. No reader can deny this — it is a factual inventory of Paul's citations. Both sides can verify which commandments Paul quotes. |
| N082 | Paul locates the law's limitation in the flesh ("weak through the flesh," Rom 8:3), not in the law itself ("the law is holy, just, good," Rom 7:12; "spiritual," Rom 7:14). The text attributes the problem to human nature, not to the law. | E010 (holy/just/good), E011 (spiritual), E062/E402 (weak through flesh) | Continues | Both E-items (law is holy/spiritual vs. limitation is in flesh) point in the same direction. An opposite-position scholar must acknowledge the text locates the weakness in the flesh, not in the law. |
| N083 | Paul's argument in Rom 6:14-15 requires that "not under the law" does NOT mean "free to sin," because Paul immediately asks "shall we sin because we are not under the law?" and answers with me genoito (strongest negation). Any reading of "not under the law" that makes sin permissible is excluded by Paul's own denial. | E394 (not under law), E395 (shall we sin? God forbid) | Neutral | Both sides must agree Paul denies that "not under law" permits sin. The sequence question-denial is textually unambiguous. |
| N084 | The stated purpose of God sending His Son (Rom 8:3-4) is "that the dikaioma of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk after the Spirit." The purpose clause (hina + subjunctive) makes law-fulfillment the GOAL of the incarnation and atonement, not a byproduct or an abolished relic. | E026/E403 (dikaioma fulfilled in us), E062/E402 (law weak through flesh) | Continues | The purpose clause is grammatically unambiguous. Both sides must acknowledge the text states this as Christ's purpose. A scholar from the opposite position cannot deny the hina-clause states purpose. |
| N085 | Paul's use of katargeo (G2673) in Rom 3:31 ("Do we katargeo the law? Me genoito! We histemi the law") and the same verb in Eph 2:15 (katargesas "the law of commandments in dogmasin") demonstrates that Paul uses the same verb to abolish one referent (dogma-ordinances) while emphatically denying the abolition of another (nomos generally). This presupposes different categories within "the law." | E025 (Rom 3:31), E262 (katargeo in both passages) | Continues | Observable: same author, same verb, opposite actions on different referents. Both sides must acknowledge Paul uses katargeo in both passages. The factual observation that he abolishes one referent and denies abolishing another is not dependent on interpretation. |

### Inferences (I-items)

*Tree 2 applied for type classification. Tree 5 applied for positional classification.*

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I102 | Paul's teaching in Romans demonstrates that the moral law (Decalogue) continues to function as the standard of righteousness for believers, with the Spirit enabling what the flesh could not accomplish. The law is not abolished but established (3:31), its dikaioma is fulfilled in Spirit-walkers (8:4), its specific commandments are the content love fulfills (13:8-10), and it remains the object of the believer's delight and service (7:22, 25). | I-A | E025 (establish the law), E026 (dikaioma fulfilled in us), E028 (love fulfills Decalogue), E010 (holy/just/good), E011 (spiritual), E399 (delight in law of God), E400 (serve law of God), E395 (shall we sin? God forbid), N081 (Paul's citations are all Decalogue), N082 (limitation in flesh not law), N084 (purpose = law-fulfillment) | Continues | This systematizes multiple E/N items into a comprehensive claim. All components are found in E/N tables. It requires only criterion #5 (systematizing). Direction: aligns with E/N — no E/N statement is required to mean something other than its lexical value. Source: all text-derived. I-A confirmed. |
| I103 | Paul's phrase "not under the law" (Rom 6:14; Gal 5:18) refers to freedom from the law's condemning jurisdiction (its penalty for sin), not freedom from the law's moral authority. This is supported by the immediate context (Rom 6:15: "shall we sin? God forbid"), Rom 8:1 ("no condemnation"), and the fact that Paul continues to cite the law as the standard of righteousness (8:4; 13:8-10). | I-A | E394 (not under law), E395 (shall we sin? God forbid), E026 (dikaioma fulfilled), E028 (love fulfills Decalogue), N083 ("not under law" does not permit sin) | Continues | Systematizes E/N items into an interpretation of "under the law." All components are text-derived. Requires #5 (systematizing from multiple passages) and #4a (SIS: plain passages — 6:15, 8:1, 8:4 — clarify the meaning of the ambiguous phrase "under the law" in 6:14). The SIS connection is verified: same author, same epistle, within two chapters. I-A. |
| I104 | Telos in Rom 10:4 means "goal/purpose" (not termination), making Christ the goal toward which the law pointed. The law itself teaches faith-righteousness (Rom 10:6-8 quotes Deut 30:12-14). The identical construction telos + law/commandment appears in 1 Tim 1:5 where telos clearly = goal. Paul denies faith voids the law (Rom 3:31). | I-A | E061/E405 (Rom 10:4 text), E406 (Torah teaches faith-righteousness), E025 (establish law), E047 (law is good if used lawfully, 1 Tim 1:8) | Continues | Systematizes text-derived data. The 1 Tim 1:5 parallel is verified SIS (#4a — same author, identical construction). The claim that telos = goal is an inference because the word telos has a semantic range, but the weight of evidence (1 Tim 1:5 parallel, Rom 3:31, Rom 10:6-8) points consistently toward "goal." All components are from E/N tables. I-A. |
| I105 | Paul's teaching in Romans abolishes the moral law (Decalogue) because "not under the law" (6:14) means the entire law is set aside, "dead to the law" (7:4) means the law itself is defunct, and "Christ is the end of the law" (10:4) means Christ terminated it. Believers are under a new "law of Christ" that replaces the Mosaic law entirely. | I-B | FOR: E394 ("not under the law"), E060 ("dead to the law"), E061 (telos could = termination). AGAINST: E010 (holy/just/good), E011 (spiritual), E025 (establish the law), E026 (dikaioma fulfilled in us), E028 (Decalogue quoted as operative), E395 (shall we sin? God forbid), E399 (delight in law of God), E400 (serve law of God), N081 (every citation = Decalogue), N082 (limitation in flesh), N084 (purpose = law-fulfillment). | Abolished | This is text-derived (all components from E/N tables) but conflicts with multiple E/N statements. "Not under the law" is required to mean complete abolition — but E395 denies this reading. "Dead to the law" is required to mean the law itself died — but E010-E011 call it holy/spiritual in the SAME CHAPTER. "Telos" must mean termination — but E406 shows the Torah teaching faith-righteousness. Criteria: #2 (choosing between readings of telos, "under the law," "dead to the law"); #5 (systematizing). I-B: E/N items on both sides. |
| I106 | Paul's argument in Romans treats all law as a single, undifferentiated unit. When Paul says "the law" he means the entire Mosaic system without distinction, and "not under the law" means all of it — moral, ceremonial, and civil — is set aside for believers. | I-D | E025 says "we establish THE law" — singular, unqualified; E028 (Rom 13:9) quotes five specific Decalogue commands as the content of "the law." E046/E396 (Rom 7:7) quotes the 10th commandment as "the law." N081 observes Paul's citations are all Decalogue. N085 observes Paul uses katargeo to abolish one referent (dogma) while denying abolition of another (nomos). | Abolished | This requires OVERRIDING E/N statements: N081 (Paul's every quotation = Decalogue, not the whole Torah); N085 (Paul abolishes one referent while denying abolition of another — presupposes distinction). The claim that all law is one unit requires adding a concept the text does not state — Paul DOES distinguish by vocabulary (nomos vs. dogma) and by content (quotes Decalogue specifically). Requires #1 (adding concept), #3 (external "all law is one" framework). I-D: external origin, overrides E/N. |
| I107 | "Dead to the law" (Rom 7:4) and "delivered from the law" (Rom 7:6) describe the believer's changed relationship to the law's condemning and sin-provoking function (as experienced through the flesh), not the abolition of the law's moral standard. This reading is supported by the fact that Paul immediately defends the law as holy/just/good/spiritual (7:12, 14) and delights in it (7:22) in the SAME context. | I-A | E060 (dead to law / delivered from law), E010 (holy/just/good), E011 (spiritual), E399 (delight in law of God), E400 (serve law of God), N082 (limitation in flesh) | Continues | Systematizes E/N items into a coherent reading of Rom 7:4, 6. All components are text-derived. No E/N is required to mean something other than its lexical value — E060 says "dead to the law" and E010 says "the law is holy"; these are reconciled by distinguishing the law's condemning function from its moral standard. Criterion #5 (systematizing). #4a applies: same author, same chapter — SIS verified. I-A. |

### I-B Resolution: I105 — Paul's teaching in Romans abolishes the moral law

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR abolition: E394 ("not under law"), E060 ("dead to law" / "delivered from law"), E061 (telos could = termination)
- AGAINST abolition: E010 (holy/just/good), E011 (spiritual), E025 (establish the law — me genoito), E026 (dikaioma fulfilled in us), E028 (five Decalogue commands quoted as operative), E395 (shall we sin? God forbid — me genoito), E399 (delight in law of God), E400 (serve law of God), N081 (every citation = Decalogue), N082 (limitation in flesh, not in law), N084 (purpose = law-fulfillment), N085 (katargeo distinction presupposes categories)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E010 (holy/just/good) | Plain | Direct predicate adjectives applied to the law without qualification |
| E011 (spiritual) | Plain | Direct predicate adjective, present tense |
| E025 (establish law) | Plain | Direct question + strongest negation + affirmation; no ambiguity |
| E026 (dikaioma fulfilled in us) | Plain | Purpose clause with identified referent (law) |
| E028 (Decalogue quoted) | Plain | Five commandments quoted by name; no ambiguity about content |
| E395 (shall we sin? God forbid) | Plain | Direct rhetorical question + me genoito |
| E399 (delight in law) | Plain | Present-tense statement with identified referent |
| E400 (serve law of God) | Plain | Present-tense statement with identified referent |
| N081 (citations = Decalogue) | Plain | Observable inventory of Paul's quotations |
| N082 (limitation in flesh) | Plain | Text explicitly states "weak through the flesh" |
| N084 (purpose = law-fulfillment) | Plain | Grammatical purpose clause |
| N085 (katargeo distinction) | Contextually Clear | Requires comparing two passages by same author |
| E394 (not under law) | Ambiguous | "Under the law" has a semantic range; context (v.15) pushes toward condemnation reading |
| E060 (dead to law) | Ambiguous | Metaphorical (marriage analogy); interpretation depends on identifying who/what "dies" |
| E061 (telos of law) | Ambiguous | Telos has a semantic range; could be goal or termination |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
- FOR abolition: 3 items, ALL at the Ambiguous level (E394, E060, E061)
- AGAINST abolition: 12 items; 11 at the Plain level, 1 at Contextually Clear level

The weight is decisively against the abolition reading. The FOR side relies entirely on ambiguous phrases that admit alternative readings. The AGAINST side has 11 Plain statements that directly state the law's positive character and ongoing role.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
The Plain statements determine the reading of the Ambiguous ones:
- E394 ("not under law"): Plain E395 ("shall we sin? God forbid!") in the immediate next verse determines that "not under law" does not mean freedom from the law's moral standard.
- E060 ("dead to law"): Plain E010-E011 in the same chapter (7:12, 14) determine that the law itself is not dead — it is "holy, just, good, spiritual." The believer died to the law's condemning function.
- E061 (telos): Plain E025 ("establish the law") and E406 (Torah teaches faith) determine telos = goal, not termination. If the law were terminated, it could not be "established" (3:31) and could not "witness to" the righteousness of God (3:21).

**Step 5 — Resolution: Strong**
Plain statements are exclusively on the AGAINST-abolition side (11 Plain + 1 Contextually Clear). The FOR-abolition side has only Ambiguous statements (3 items), all of which admit non-abolition readings that are determined by the Plain statements via SIS. The Abolished reading of Romans requires ALL three ambiguous items to be read in their abolition sense while ignoring or reinterpreting 11 Plain statements in the same epistle. Resolution: Strong against the Abolished reading.

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases actual verse text. Checked.
- Each is the plain meaning of the words in the verse. Checked.
- No E-item is a positional inference. Items stating what the text says (E010: "the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good") are textual facts.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- E389 (Rom 2:13) — Continues: doers of law justified. Tree 3 passed all four gates. Subject identifiable as moral law (context quotes steal, adultery, idols in vv.21-22). Classification stands.
- E390 (Rom 2:14-15) — extends E037. Continues classification already verified in prior studies.
- E391 (Rom 3:20) — Neutral: diagnostic function. Both sides accept. Classification stands.
- E392 (Rom 3:21) — Continues: law witnesses to righteousness. Tree 3 passed. Classification stands.
- E393 (Rom 3:27) — Neutral: vocabulary observation. Classification stands.
- E394 (Rom 6:14) — Neutral after reclassification via Gate 1. "Under the law" ambiguous. Classification stands.
- E395 (Rom 6:15) — Continues: denial that "not under law" permits sin. Tree 3 passed. Classification stands.
- E397-E398 — Neutral. Both sides accept sin uses the commandment. Classification stands.
- E399-E400 — Continues: delight/serve the law of God. Tree 3 passed. Classification stands.
- E401 — Neutral: nomos = principle. Classification stands.
- E406 — Continues: Torah teaches faith. Tree 3 passed. Classification stands.
- E408 — Continues: pleroma of law. Tree 3 passed. Classification stands.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- N080 (multiple senses of nomos): Universal agreement — both sides acknowledge Paul uses nomos differently. Zero added concepts. Neutral. Confirmed.
- N081 (citations = Decalogue): Observable fact. Both sides can verify. Continues (supports distinction between moral and other law). Confirmed.
- N082 (limitation in flesh): Text states it. Both sides must acknowledge. Continues. Confirmed.
- N083 (not under law ≠ free to sin): Text states it in consecutive verses. Universal agreement. Neutral. Confirmed.
- N084 (purpose = law-fulfillment): Grammatical purpose clause. Both sides must acknowledge the hina-clause. Continues. Confirmed.
- N085 (katargeo distinction): Observable: same author, same verb, different actions. Both sides can verify. Continues. Confirmed.

**Steps C-E: Verify inference classifications.**
- I102 (I-A Continues): Source test — all components in E/N tables. Direction test — no E/N required to mean other than lexical value. Consistency — only criterion #5. Confirmed I-A.
- I103 (I-A Continues): Source test — all text-derived. Direction — aligns. Consistency — #5 + #4a (verified SIS). Confirmed I-A.
- I104 (I-A Continues): Source test — all text-derived. Direction — aligns (telos = goal is supported by 1 Tim 1:5, Rom 3:31, Rom 10:6-8). Consistency — #5 + #4a. Confirmed I-A.
- I105 (I-B Abolished): Source test — text-derived. Direction — conflicts with E/N (requires "not under law" to mean abolition, contradicting E395; requires "dead to law" to mean law abolished, contradicting E010-E011; requires telos = termination, contradicting E025). E/N items on BOTH sides — confirmed I-B. Full resolution section provided. Resolved Strong against Abolished.
- I106 (I-D Abolished): Source test — requires adding "all law is one unit" concept not found in E/N. Direction — overrides N081 (Paul distinguishes by quoting Decalogue specifically), N085 (Paul distinguishes by vocabulary). Confirmed I-D.
- I107 (I-A Continues): Source test — all text-derived. Direction — aligns. Consistency — #5 + #4a (same chapter). Confirmed I-A.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- I103: SIS connection between Rom 6:14 (ambiguous) and Rom 6:15 + 8:1 + 8:4 (plain). Connection: same author, same epistle, within two chapters. Verified.
- I104: SIS connection between Rom 10:4 (ambiguous telos) and 1 Tim 1:5 (plain telos = goal). Connection: same author, identical construction (telos + genitive of commandment/law). Verified.
- I105 resolution: SIS connections verified (same chapter, same epistle, same author throughout).
- I107: SIS connection between Rom 7:4, 6 (ambiguous) and Rom 7:12, 14, 22 (plain). Connection: same chapter. Verified.

## What CAN Be Said

Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies:

- Paul identifies "the law" (nomos) with the Decalogue when he quotes specific content (Rom 7:7 = 10th command; Rom 13:9 = 6th-10th commands)
- The law is holy, just, good, and spiritual (Rom 7:12, 14)
- Faith establishes the law; it does not make it void (Rom 3:31)
- The law gives knowledge of sin (Rom 3:20; 7:7)
- The law cannot justify — no flesh is justified by works of law (Rom 3:20, 28)
- Believers are not under the law's condemning jurisdiction but under grace (Rom 6:14; 8:1)
- Being "not under the law" does not permit sin (Rom 6:15)
- The righteous requirement (dikaioma) of the law is fulfilled IN Spirit-walking believers (Rom 8:4)
- The law's limitation is in the flesh, not in the law itself (Rom 8:3)
- Love fulfills the law by fulfilling its specific commandments (Rom 13:8-10)
- Gentiles show the work of the law written on their hearts (Rom 2:14-15)
- The Torah itself teaches faith-righteousness (Rom 10:6-8 quoting Deut 30:12-14)
- Paul uses katargeo to abolish one law-referent (dogma/ordinances) while emphatically denying the abolition of another (nomos/law generally)

## What CANNOT Be Said

Neither side can claim the text of Romans directly says or necessarily implies:

- That Paul ever identifies the moral law (Decalogue) as abolished in Romans — no verse in Romans states this
- That "not under the law" means "free from all moral obligation" — Paul explicitly denies this (6:15)
- That "dead to the law" means the law itself is dead — the same chapter calls it holy/spiritual
- That telos in Rom 10:4 definitively means "termination" — the word has a semantic range, and the context favors "goal"
- That Paul treats all law as a single undifferentiated unit — his vocabulary and citations demonstrate distinctions
- That the law is abolished and replaced by a "law of love" — Paul quotes the Decalogue as the content love fulfills, not as what love replaces
- That the Spirit replaces the law — the Spirit fulfills the law's requirement (8:4), not a different requirement
- That moral law can justify — Paul is clear no flesh is justified by law-works (3:20)

## Conclusion

Paul's treatment of the law in Romans is the most extensive law-theology in the NT. Across 74 uses of nomos in the epistle, Paul distinguishes between the law's multiple functions: it diagnoses sin (3:20; 7:7), it cannot justify (3:20), it is the standard of righteousness (8:4; 13:8-10), and faith establishes it (3:31). When Paul specifies the content of nomos by direct quotation, every citation is a Decalogue commandment (7:7 = 10th command; 13:9 = 6th through 10th commands). He calls this law "holy, just, and good" (7:12), "spiritual" (7:14), a source of delight (7:22), and the object of his mental service (7:25).

The phrases "not under the law" (6:14), "dead to the law" (7:4), and "delivered from the law" (7:6) describe the believer's changed relationship to the law's condemning function, not the law's abolition. Paul's immediate context makes this clear: he denies that "not under law" permits sin (6:15, me genoito), and he defends the law as holy/spiritual in the same chapter where he says believers are "dead to the law" (7:4, 12, 14).

The climactic statement of Paul's law-theology in Romans is 8:3-4: what the law could not accomplish through the flesh, God accomplished by sending His Son — so that THE righteous requirement (dikaioma, singular) of the law might be fulfilled IN believers who walk by the Spirit. The Spirit does not replace the law; the Spirit enables the law's fulfillment.

All explicit statements and necessary implications from Romans that bear positionally on the moral law point toward the Continues classification. The Abolished reading of Romans is classified as I-B (competing evidence), resolved Strong against abolition: the FOR side relies on three ambiguous phrases (E394, E060, E061), while the AGAINST side has 11 Plain statements and 1 Contextually Clear statement.
