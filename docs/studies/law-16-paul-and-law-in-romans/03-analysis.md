# Verse Analysis: Paul and the Law in Romans

## Passage-by-Passage Analysis

### Romans 2:12-16 — Law Written on Gentile Hearts

**Context:** Paul is establishing that all humanity — Jew and Gentile — stands under God's judgment. Romans 1:18-32 addressed Gentile sin. Romans 2:1-11 addressed hypocritical Jewish judgment. Romans 2:12-16 explains the basis for judgment of both groups.

**Direct statements:**
- v.12: Those who sinned "without law" (anomos — without the written Torah) will perish "without law"; those who sinned "in the law" will be judged "by the law." The law is the standard of judgment.
- v.13: "Not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified." Doing the law — not merely possessing it — is the criterion.
- v.14: Gentiles "which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law." The phrase "the things contained in the law" (ta tou nomou) identifies specific moral content.
- v.15: These Gentiles "shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness." Two witnesses: (1) the work of the law written on hearts, and (2) conscience accusing or excusing.

**Key observations:**
- The phrase "the work of the law written in their hearts" (to ergon tou nomou grapton en tais kardiais) uses grapton (written) — the same concept as Jer 31:33 ("I will write [katab/grapho] it in their hearts") and 2 Cor 3:3 ("written not with ink...not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart").
- Paul's argument requires that the moral content of the law is knowable apart from the written Torah. Gentiles who never received the Sinai code nonetheless do "the things contained in the law" because the law's moral content is inscribed on the human heart.
- The nomos here refers to moral law — the conscience testifies to moral obligations (do not murder, do not steal, do not lie). It does not testify to ceremonial regulations (which day to sacrifice, which animals are clean).

**Cross-references:**
- Jer 31:33 / Heb 8:10 — new covenant promise to write "my law" on hearts uses the same verb (grapho/katab) and the same location (hearts). Law-11 established that four convergent markers identify this as the Decalogue.
- Rom 1:19-20 — God's moral attributes are knowable through creation, establishing a universal moral baseline.

### Romans 3:19-31 — Knowledge of Sin, Justification, Establishing the Law

**Context:** Paul has established universal guilt (1:18-3:18). Now he draws conclusions about the law's function, the impossibility of justification by works, and the relationship between faith and law.

**Direct statements:**
- v.19: "What things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God." The law's diagnostic function: it renders all guilty.
- v.20: "By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin." Two statements: (1) no justification by law-works; (2) the law gives knowledge of sin.
- v.21: "The righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets." The righteousness by faith is APART FROM law-works but WITNESSED BY the law itself. The law testifies to faith-righteousness.
- v.27: Paul introduces two principles: "law of works" vs. "law of faith." The word nomos here means "principle" or "operating system" — not the Torah.
- v.28: "A man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law." Justification is by faith, not by law-keeping as a meritorious achievement.
- v.31: "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."

**Key observations:**
- The Greek in v.31 is emphatic. Katargoumen (from katargeo, [G2673](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2673/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} — "do we nullify?") is answered with me genoito (the strongest possible negation: "may it never be!") followed by histanomen (from histemi, [G2476](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2476/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} — "we establish/uphold"). Present tense in both cases: this is an ongoing, present reality.
- Katargeo is the same verb used in Eph 2:15 for abolishing "the law of commandments in ordinances." Paul uses the SAME VERB to abolish one referent (dogma-ordinances, Eph 2:15) and emphatically deny abolishing another (nomos, Rom 3:31). This is a vocabulary distinction that presupposes different categories of law.
- The law cannot justify (v.20), but it is not voided (v.31). The law defines sin (v.20), witnesses to faith-righteousness (v.21), and is established by faith (v.31). These functions are complementary, not contradictory.
- v.21: The law itself WITNESSES to faith-righteousness. This is consistent with Rom 10:6-8, where Paul quotes Deut 30:12-14 — the Torah itself teaches the nearness of the word of faith.

### Romans 6:14-15 — "Not Under the Law But Under Grace"

**Context:** Romans 6 addresses sanctification. Paul has argued that believers died with Christ (vv.1-13) and should not continue in sin. Verse 14 provides the reason sin will not have dominion.

**Direct statements:**
- v.14: "For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace." The Greek: hamartia gar hymon ou kyrieusei; ou gar este hypo nomon alla hypo charin.
- v.15: "What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid."

**Key observations:**
- The grammatical structure of v.14: "Sin will NOT rule over you BECAUSE you are not under law but under grace." The "not under law" clause is the REASON sin does not rule — not a permission to sin.
- Paul's immediate question in v.15 ("shall we sin because we are not under law?") anticipates the misreading that "not under law" means "free to sin." His emphatic denial (me genoito) demonstrates that "not under law" does NOT mean the law is abolished or that sin is permissible.
- The Greek hypo nomon (under law) appears in Paul's letters as a status or jurisdiction term (see also Gal 3:23; 4:4-5, 21; 5:18; 1 Cor 9:20). Being "under the law" in Paul's usage means being under the law's condemning power — under its penalty for violation.
- The contrast is between two realms of dominion: under law (where sin exploits the law to condemn, per Rom 7:8-11) vs. under grace (where sin's condemning power is broken by Christ's redemption).
- This passage does NOT state that the law is abolished. It states that believers' relationship to the law has changed: they are no longer under its condemnation (cf. 8:1: "no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus"). The law remains the standard of righteousness (8:4), but grace provides what the law demanded.

### Romans 7:1-6 — Dead to the Law, Marriage Analogy

**Context:** Paul uses a marriage analogy to explain the believer's changed relationship to the law. He addresses those "who know the law" (v.1).

**Direct statements:**
- v.1: "The law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth."
- vv.2-3: The marriage analogy — a woman is bound to her husband while he lives; freed when he dies.
- v.4: "Ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God."
- v.6: "But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter."

**Key observations:**
- In the analogy, WHO DIES matters. In vv.2-3, the husband dies, freeing the wife. In v.4, "ye also are become dead" — the BELIEVER dies (with Christ), not the law. The analogy does not teach that the law died; it teaches that the believer died to the law's condemning jurisdiction.
- v.4: The purpose of dying to the law is not lawlessness but fruitfulness: "that we should bring forth fruit unto God."
- v.6: "Newness of spirit" vs. "oldness of the letter" — the contrast is between Spirit-empowered obedience and external, letter-only compliance. The Spirit enables what the letter demanded (connecting to 8:4).
- Paul immediately anticipates the inference that the law is bad (v.7: "Is the law sin? God forbid!") and launches into an extended defense of the law's goodness.

---

### Romans 7:7-13 — The Law Reveals Sin, the Commandment Is Holy

**Context:** Paul defends the law against the inference that dying to the law means the law is sinful.

**Direct statements:**
- v.7: "Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." Paul quotes the 10th commandment (Exo 20:17) — identifying nomos with the Decalogue.
- v.8: "Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence." Sin is the active agent; the commandment is the occasion, not the cause.
- v.9: "When the commandment came, sin revived, and I died." The commandment exposes and activates sin's condemnation.
- v.10: "The commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death." The commandment's purpose was life; sin perverted its effect.
- v.12: "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."
- v.13: "Sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful." The law is "good" (agathos); sin uses this good thing to produce death.

**Key observations:**
- Paul identifies the specific commandment as "Thou shalt not covet" (v.7) — the 10th Decalogue commandment. The nomos and the entole in this passage are explicitly Decalogue content.
- The three attributes of v.12 (hagia = holy, dikaia = just/righteous, agathe = good) are the same attributes Scripture ascribes to God. The law reflects God's character.
- The Greek parsing of v.7 shows elegen (Imperfect Active Indicative of lego): the law "was saying" — ongoing, continuous speech. The law continues to speak.
- The problem Paul identifies is not the law but sin. The law is holy; the commandment is holy, just, and good. Sin is the malefactor that perverts the good law's effect. This is a defense of the law's nature, not a critique.

### Romans 7:14-25 — The Law Is Spiritual, Delight in the Law of God

**Context:** Paul describes the believer's internal struggle between the spiritual law and the carnal flesh.

**Direct statements:**
- v.14: "We know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin." The law is pneumatikos (spiritual); the person is sarkinos (made of flesh).
- v.16: "If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good." Even in failure, Paul affirms the law's goodness.
- v.22: "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man." The Greek synedomai (Present Middle/Passive Indicative) = ongoing present delight. "The law of God" (to nomo tou theou) = the Decalogue (per law-07 study).
- v.23: "But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members." Three uses of nomos in one verse: (1) "law in my members" = sin's principle; (2) "law of my mind" = the moral law as understood and affirmed; (3) "law of sin" = sin's enslaving principle.
- v.25: "With the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin." Two allegiances: mind serves God's law; flesh serves sin's law.

**Key observations:**
- Paul uses nomos in at least three senses in this section: (1) the moral law of God (vv.22, 25 — "the law of God"), (2) a principle or pattern (vv.21, 23 — "law in my members," "law of sin"), and (3) the law as internal moral standard (v.23 — "law of my mind").
- The law is described as "spiritual" (v.14). Pneumatikos is an attribute of the Holy Spirit's domain. The law belongs to the spiritual realm, not the carnal.
- Paul's "delight in the law of God after the inward man" (v.22) echoes Psalm 1:2 ("his delight is in the law of the LORD") and Psalm 119:97 ("O how love I thy law!"). This is not grudging acknowledgment but active delight.
- The conflict is between flesh and law, not between grace and law. The solution to the conflict is not abolishing the law but overcoming the flesh — which is precisely what Romans 8 addresses.

---

### Romans 8:1-4 — The Spirit Fulfills the Law's Righteousness in Us

**Context:** Romans 8 resolves the conflict described in Romans 7. The answer is the Spirit.

**Direct statements:**
- v.1: "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
- v.2: "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death." Two "laws" (principles): the Spirit's life-giving principle frees from sin's death-dealing principle.
- v.3: "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh."
- v.4: "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
- v.7: "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."

**Key observations:**
- v.3: The law's limitation is explicitly located in the FLESH, not in the law itself: "weak through the flesh" (dia tes sarkos). The law is not defective; human nature is.
- v.4: The purpose clause (hina + Aorist Passive Subjunctive plerothe) states God's purpose in sending His Son: "so that the dikaioma (righteous requirement) of the law might be fulfilled IN US." The Greek en hemin ("in us") — not "for us" or "instead of us." The fulfillment happens within believers.
- Dikaioma (G1345) is singular with the article: "THE righteous requirement" — a unified moral standard. This is the same word used in Rom 2:26 ("the righteousness of the law") for Gentiles who keep it.
- The fulfillment is conditional: "in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (tois me kata sarka peripatousin alla kata pneuma). Present Active Participle peripatousin = ongoing walk. The Spirit enables ongoing law-fulfillment.
- v.7: The carnal mind is "not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." The law of God remains the standard to which the mind should be subject. The problem is the carnal mind's inability — not the law's inapplicability. The Spirit resolves this (v.4).
- The flow: the law could not produce righteousness through the flesh (v.3) -> God sent His Son to condemn sin (v.3) -> so that the law's righteous requirement would be fulfilled in Spirit-walkers (v.4). The law's standard is not removed; the means of meeting it changes from flesh to Spirit.

### Romans 10:4 — Christ the Telos of the Law

**Context:** Paul is discussing Israel's failure to attain righteousness (9:30-10:3). Israel pursued righteousness by works rather than by faith.

**Direct statements:**
- v.3: Israel, "being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."
- v.4: "For Christ is the end [telos] of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."
- vv.6-8: Paul quotes Deut 30:12-14 as "the righteousness which is of faith" — the Torah itself teaches faith-righteousness.

**Key observations:**
- Telos (G5056) has two primary senses: (1) termination/end and (2) goal/purpose/completion. The existing romans-10-4-telos study analyzed this extensively and concluded telos = goal/purpose, based on:
  - 1 Tim 1:5: "The telos of the commandment is charity." Identical construction (telos + law/commandment), and in 1 Tim 1:5, telos = goal (love is the goal of the commandment, not its termination).
  - The root tello means "to set out for a definite point or goal."
  - Paul explicitly denies that faith voids the law (Rom 3:31).
  - Gal 3:24: "the law was our schoolmaster unto Christ" — the law led toward Christ, its goal.
- vv.6-8 are decisive for interpretation: Paul quotes the Torah (Deut 30:12-14) and identifies it as "the righteousness which is of faith." The LAW ITSELF teaches faith-righteousness. If the law were terminated by Christ, it would make no sense for Paul to quote the law as a witness to faith-righteousness.
- v.5 vs. v.6: Paul distinguishes "the righteousness which is of the law" (law as method of earning — citing Lev 18:5) from "the righteousness which is of faith" (quoting Deut 30:12-14). Both quotes are from the Torah. The law itself contains both the works-principle and the faith-principle. Christ fulfills the law's own faith-witness.
- The context (9:30-10:3) identifies Israel's problem as self-righteousness ("establish their own righteousness"), not as law-keeping per se. Christ is the goal toward which the law pointed; believing in Christ is what the law always intended.

---

### Romans 13:8-10 — Love Fulfills the Law, Decalogue Cited

**Context:** Romans 13 discusses civil obligations (vv.1-7) and then turns to mutual love obligations. Paul explicitly connects love to the Decalogue.

**Direct statements:**
- v.8: "He that loveth another hath fulfilled the law." Perfect Active Indicative pepletoken = "has fulfilled" — completed action with ongoing results.
- v.9: "For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
- v.10: "Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."

**Key observations:**
- Paul explicitly quotes FIVE Decalogue commandments: 7th (adultery), 6th (murder), 8th (theft), 9th (false witness), 10th (covet). These are the "second table" commands (neighbor-relationship). He adds "if there be any other commandment" (ei tis hetera entole) — acknowledging MORE commandments exist.
- The Greek anakephalaioatai (Present Passive Indicative of anakephalaioo) = "is being summed up / comprehended." The commandments ARE (present, ongoing) summed up in love. They are comprehended under love, not replaced by love.
- Pleroma (G4138) in v.10 = "fullness/fulfillment" — a noun, not a verb. Love IS the fullness of the law. Love is the content that fills the law's container. The container (law) remains; love fills it.
- This passage is Paul's most explicit identification of nomos with the Decalogue. There is no ambiguity about which law he means — he quotes specific commandments by name.
- The structure: love fulfills the law (v.8) BECAUSE the law's specific commands are comprehended in love (v.9) BECAUSE love works no ill to a neighbor (v.10). The reasoning assumes the law's commands remain in force and love is the means of fulfilling them.

## Greek Grammar Insights

### The Imperfect Tense of the Law's Speech (Rom 7:7)
The verb elegen (Imperfect Active Indicative of lego) in Rom 7:7 describes the law as "was saying" — continuous, ongoing action. The law continues to speak its prohibitions. This is grammatically inconsistent with abolition.

### The Present Tense of Delight and Service (Rom 7:22, 25)
Synedomai (Present Middle/Passive Indicative) = "I delight" — ongoing, present delight. The "law of God" is the object of present-tense delight and service.

### The Purpose Clause of Rom 8:4
Hina + plerothe (Aorist Passive Subjunctive) = a purpose/result clause. God sent His Son FOR THE PURPOSE OF the law's dikaioma being fulfilled in believers. The Spirit's work is directed toward law-fulfillment, not law-abolition.

### The Perfect Tense of Fulfillment (Rom 13:8)
Pepletoken (Perfect Active Indicative of pleroo) = "has fulfilled" — a completed action with ongoing results. The one who loves HAS fulfilled and continues to fulfil the law. The law remains as the object being fulfilled.

### The Present Tense of Comprehension (Rom 13:9)
Anakephalaioatai (Present Passive Indicative) = the commandments ARE BEING summed up in love. Ongoing, present action — not a past replacement.

### Histemi vs. Katargeo (Rom 3:31)
Katargoumen (Present Active Indicative of katargeo) = "do we nullify?" met with me genoito (strongest negation) and histanomen (Present Active Indicative of histemi) = "we establish." The establishment of the law is a present, ongoing reality of faith.

## How Paul Uses Nomos in Different Senses

Paul uses nomos approximately 74 times in Romans. The word carries different senses depending on context:

1. **The Mosaic Torah as a comprehensive code** — Rom 2:12-13, 17-23, 25-27; 3:19-21, 28; 4:13-16; 5:13, 20; 7:1-7. In these passages, nomos refers to the written Torah given at Sinai.

2. **The moral law (Decalogue specifically)** — Rom 7:7 (quotes 10th commandment), 7:12, 7:14, 7:22, 7:25; 8:4, 8:7; 13:8-10 (quotes commandments 6-10). In these passages, Paul identifies nomos with specific Decalogue content or uses "law of God" (nomos tou theou), which law-07 established refers to the Decalogue.

3. **A principle or operating pattern** — Rom 3:27 ("law of works" vs. "law of faith"), 7:21, 7:23 ("law in my members," "law of my mind," "law of sin"), 8:2 ("law of the Spirit of life," "law of sin and death"). Here nomos means "operating principle" — not the Torah.

4. **The law as a witness/Scripture** — Rom 3:21 ("witnessed by the law and the prophets"). Here "the law" refers to the Pentateuch as a literary corpus.

This semantic range means that any interpretation of a Romans passage must identify WHICH sense of nomos Paul intends in THAT context. Applying the wrong sense produces misinterpretation.

---

## Patterns Identified

1. **The law is never the problem; the flesh is.** Throughout Romans, the law is called holy, just, good (7:12), spiritual (7:14), and its dikaioma is what the Spirit fulfills in believers (8:4). The limitation is always located in the flesh (7:14, 18; 8:3, 7), never in the law.

2. **Faith establishes rather than abolishes the law.** Rom 3:31 is the programmatic statement, and Rom 8:4 and 13:8-10 demonstrate HOW: faith works through love, and love fulfills the law's commandments.

3. **Paul identifies nomos with the Decalogue when specifying content.** He quotes the 10th commandment (7:7), the 6th-10th commandments (13:9), and calls this law "holy, just, good, spiritual," "the law of God." He never identifies nomos with the Decalogue and then abolishes it.

4. **"Not under the law" means not under its condemnation, not free from its standard.** Rom 6:14-15 is immediately followed by "shall we sin? God forbid!" and Rom 8:1 ("no condemnation") states the positive: what "not under law" means is "no condemnation."

5. **The Spirit enables what the law demands.** The law-Spirit relationship is complementary, not competitive. The Spirit enables the dikaioma of the law to be fulfilled (8:4), not by abolishing the standard but by empowering obedience.

6. **Christ is the goal of the law, not its termination.** Rom 10:4 (telos = goal) is confirmed by the law's own testimony to faith-righteousness (10:6-8, quoting Deut 30:12-14).

---

## Connections Between Passages

The argument of Romans follows a logical progression regarding the law:

- **Rom 2:12-16**: The law is the universal moral standard (even Gentiles have it on their hearts)
- **Rom 3:19-20**: The law diagnoses sin in all humanity
- **Rom 3:21-28**: Justification is by faith, not by law-works
- **Rom 3:31**: BUT faith establishes the law (it does not void it)
- **Rom 6:14-15**: Believers are not under the law's condemnation, but this does not permit sin
- **Rom 7:7-13**: The law is holy, just, good — sin is the problem, not the law
- **Rom 7:14-25**: The law is spiritual; believers delight in it but struggle with the flesh
- **Rom 8:1-4**: The Spirit resolves the conflict by fulfilling the law's dikaioma in believers
- **Rom 10:4**: Christ is the goal toward which the law pointed
- **Rom 13:8-10**: Love fulfills the specific Decalogue commandments

This is a coherent progression: the law remains the standard, but the means of meeting that standard has changed from flesh-effort to Spirit-empowerment through Christ.

## Difficult Passages

### "Ye also are become dead to the law" (Rom 7:4)
The text states believers died to the law — not that the law died. The analogy (vv.2-3) requires the death of one party to change the legal relationship, not the elimination of the law itself. The purpose is union with Christ (v.4) and fruitfulness (v.4), not lawlessness. Paul immediately defends the law's goodness (vv.7-12).

### "We are delivered from the law" (Rom 7:6)
Deliverance from the law's condemning and sin-provoking function (as experienced through the flesh) is not identical to the law's abolition. v.6b states the result: "serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter." The service continues; the mode changes from letter to Spirit.

### "What the law could not do" (Rom 8:3)
The law's inability is located "in that it was weak through the flesh" — not through any deficiency in the law itself. What the law could not do was produce righteousness through fallen flesh. God accomplished what was needed by sending His Son — specifically so that "the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us" (v.4). The law's standard remains; the enabling power changes.

### "Not under the law" (Rom 6:14)
The immediate context (v.15: "shall we sin? God forbid!") excludes reading "not under the law" as license to violate the law. Paul uses hypo nomon for the status of being under the law's condemning power, not for being under its moral authority. Being "under grace" means sin's condemning use of the law is broken — not that the law itself is removed.
