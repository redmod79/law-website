## Question
What does Paul teach about the law in Romans? Examine Romans 2:12-16, 3:19-31, 6:14-15, 7:1-25, 8:1-4, 10:4, and 13:8-10. What is Paul's understanding of the law's nature, function, and ongoing role (if any) for the believer? How do these passages relate to the Continues/Abolished question for the moral law (Ten Commandments)?

## Topics

### LAW
**General scriptures:** PSA 19:7-9; 119:1-8; PRO 28:4,5; MAT 22:21; LUK 16:17; 20:22-25; ROM 2:14,15; 7:7,12,14; 13:10; 1TI 1:5,8-10; JAS 1:25; 1JN 3:4; 5:3

**Key observations from Nave's entry:**
- The "General scriptures" section includes ROM 2:14,15; 7:7,12,14; 13:10 -- these are core study passages
- References 1JN 3:4 ("sin is the transgression of the law") and 1JN 5:3 ("this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments")
- The "OF MOSES" subsection notes: "Was given because of transgressions until the Messiah arrived GAL 3:19"
- The "Engraved on stone" subsection: EXO 20:3-17; with 24:12; 31:18; 32:16; DEU 4:13; 5:4-22; 9:10
- The "Prophecies in, of the Messiah" subsection includes ROM 3:21,22 ("witnessed by the law and the prophets")

**TEMPORARY classification (Nave's):** JER 3:16; DAN 9:27; MAT 5:17-45; LUK 16:16,17; JHN 1:17; 4:20-24; 8:35; ACT 6:14; 10:28; 13:39; 15:1-29; 21:20-25; ROM 3:1,2; 7:1-6; 8:3; 10:4; 2CO 3:7-14; GAL 2:3-9; 4:30,31; EPH 2:15; COL 2:14-23; HEB 8:4-13; 9:8-24; 10:1-18; 11:40; 12:18,19,27

*Note: Nave's classifies several of our study passages (ROM 7:1-6; 8:3; 10:4) under "Temporary." The analysis agent should evaluate whether these passages teach the temporariness of the moral law specifically, or of a law-function (condemnation, justification-by-works, ceremonial system).*

### JUSTIFICATION
**General scriptures:** GEN 15:6; PSA 32:2; 71:16; 89:16; ISA 42:21; 45:24,25; 46:12,13; 50:8; 51:5,6; 53:11; 54:17; 56:1; 61:10; JER 23:6; HAB 2:4; ZEC 3:4; JHN 5:24; ACT 13:39; ROM 1:16,17; 2:13; 3:21,22,24-26,28,30; 4:3-25; 5:1,9,11-21; 6:22; 7:1-25; 8:1,30,31,33,34; 9:30-32; 10:1-21; 1CO 1:30; 6:11; 2CO 5:19,21; GAL 2:14-21; 3:6,8,9,11,21,22,24; 4:21-31; 5:4-6; EPH 6:14; PHP 3:8,9; COL 2:13,14; TIT 3:7; HEB 11:4,7; JAS 2:20-23,26

**Key observations:** Nearly every chapter of Romans (1-10) is listed. ROM 2:13 ("the doers of the law shall be justified") and ROM 3:28 ("justified by faith without the deeds of the law") both appear in the same topic -- both are true simultaneously.

### CONSCIENCE
**General scriptures:** JOB 15:21,24; 27:6; PRO 20:12; MAT 5:15,16; 6:22,23; LUK 11:33-36; ACT 23:1; 24:16; ROM 2:14,15; 7:15-22,23; 9:1; 14:1-23; 1CO 8:7-13; 10:32; 2CO 1:12; 4:2; 5:11; 1TI 1:5,19; 3:9; HEB 9:14; 10:22; 13:18; 1PE 2:19; 3:16,21; 1JN 3:20,21

**Key observations:** ROM 2:14,15 (Gentiles showing "the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness") is listed here. Also ROM 7:15-22,23 (Paul's inner conflict with sin and the law) -- conscience as the mechanism by which the law speaks internally.

### FAITH
**General scriptures (key Romans refs):** ROM 1:16,17; 4:1-25; 5:1; 9:31-33; 10:6-10; 11:20,23; 15:13
**In Christ (key Romans refs):** ROM 3:22-28; 9:33; 10:4,9; GAL 2:16; 3:1-29; 5:6

**Key observations:** Faith and law are not opposed -- ROM 3:22-28 (justified by faith) is listed alongside the general scriptures affirming law. ROM 10:4,9 is listed under "IN CHRIST."

### SIN
**Paul's discussion of responsibility:** ROM 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9
**Sinfulness of:** ROM 7:13
**Defining and illustrating:** ROM 5:12-21; 7:7,13; 14:23; 1JN 3:4
**Fruits of:** ROM 5:12-21; 7:5
**Repugnant to righteous:** ROM 7:15,19,23,24
**Separates from God:** ROM 8:7

**Key observations:** 1JN 3:4 ("sin is the transgression of the law") appears in the "defining" section. ROM 7:7 ("I had not known sin, but by the law") and ROM 7:13 ("sin...might become exceeding sinful") show law's function in exposing sin.

### GRACE OF GOD
**Key Romans refs:** ROM 3:22-24; 4:4,5,16; 5:2,6-8,15-21; 9:10-16; 11:5,6
**Key observations:** Grace is operative through faith (ROM 4:16), not opposed to law but to works-righteousness as a method of justification. ROM 5:15-21 contrasts the reign of sin with the reign of grace.

### GENTILES
**Unclassified scriptures:** ROM 1:18-32; 2:1-15; GAL 2:15; EPH 2:12
**Conversion of:** ROM 1:5-7; 9:22-30; 10:19,20; 11:11-13,17-21; 15:9-12

**Key observations:** ROM 2:1-15 is central -- Gentiles who "do by nature the things contained in the law" show the law written on their hearts. This connects to the new covenant promise (Jer 31:33).

### COMMANDMENTS
**General scriptures:** EXO 13:8-10; 20:3-17; DEU 4:5,9,10; 5:6-21; 6:4-9; 11:18-21; 32:46,47; JOS 8:30-35; 2CH 17:7-9; NEH 8:2-8; PSA 78:1-7
**Precepts of Paul:** ROM 12:1-3,6-21; 13:8-14; 14:19-21; 15:1,2
**Of men:** ROM 14:1-6,10-23; 1TI 4:1-3

**Key observations:** ROM 13:8-14 is listed under "Precepts of Paul" -- Paul's commandment to love as law fulfillment. ROM 14:1-6,10-23 is listed under "Of men" -- human commandments (dietary/days) distinguished from divine.

### HOLINESS
**Key Romans refs:** ROM 2:28,29; 6:1-23; 7:4,6; 8:1,4,12; 11:16; 12:1,2,9; 13:12-14; 14:17; 16:19

**Key observations:** ROM 6:1-23 (entire chapter on holiness/sanctification) listed here. ROM 8:1,4 ("righteousness of the law fulfilled in us") included. ROM 13:12-14 (put on armour of light) connects law-keeping with holiness.

### HOLY SPIRIT
**Key Romans refs:** ROM 1:4; 5:3-5; 8:1-27; 9:1; 11:33,34; 14:17; 15:13,16,18,19,30

**Key observations:** ROM 8:1-27 is extensively covered -- the Spirit's role in relation to law. The Spirit enables what the law demanded (8:4). GAL 5:17,18,22,23,25 provides parallel -- walking in Spirit produces fruit that fulfills the law.

### TESTAMENT
**The new:** MAT 26:28; MRK 14:24; LUK 22:20; 1CO 11:25
**See COVENANT**

**Key observations:** Brief entry, but connects to the new covenant theme central to this study (Jer 31:31-34 / Heb 8:8-13).
