# Verse Analysis: Paul and the Law in Galatians

## The Galatian Context

Before analyzing individual passages, the historical context must be established from the letter itself. Paul writes to churches in Galatia (1:2) that have been "removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel" (1:6). The troublers "would pervert the gospel of Christ" (1:7). The specific issue is identified throughout:

- **Gal 2:3-4** -- False brethren sought to compel circumcision and "bring us into bondage"
- **Gal 2:12** -- Peter withdrew from Gentiles "fearing them which were of the circumcision"
- **Gal 2:14** -- The issue is compelling "Gentiles to live as do the Jews"
- **Gal 5:2-3** -- "If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing...debtor to do the whole law"
- **Gal 5:11** -- Paul is persecuted because he does NOT preach circumcision
- **Gal 6:12-13** -- Those who "constrain you to be circumcised" do not themselves keep the law; they want to "glory in your flesh"
- **Acts 15:1** -- The same controversy: "Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved"

The Galatian controversy is specifically about whether Gentile believers must submit to circumcision and the ceremonial Jewish system as a requirement for salvation. This is the lens through which every "law" passage in Galatians must be read.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Galatians 2:16 -- "Not Justified by Works of the Law"

> "Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."

**Context:** Paul is recounting his confrontation with Peter at Antioch (2:11-14). Peter had been eating with Gentiles but withdrew when the circumcision party arrived. Paul rebuked him publicly. Verses 15-21 are Paul's speech to Peter -- "We who are Jews by nature" (v.15) -- addressed to Jewish believers who already know the law.

**Direct statement:** No human being (anthropos, pasa sarx) is justified by "works of the law" (ergon nomou). Justification comes through faith in/of Jesus Christ (pisteos Christou).

**Greek grammar insights:**
- dikaioo (G1344) appears three times: Present Passive Indicative (general truth), Aorist Passive Subjunctive (purpose clause), Future Passive Indicative (universal declaration)
- nomos (G3551) appears three times, all genitive singular -- "of law"
- The threefold repetition of "ex ergon nomou" (from works of law) hammers the point: law-works do not justify
- pisteos Christou (genitive) -- "faith of/in Christ" -- the contrast is between two sources of justification

**Which "law" is being addressed?** The immediate context is Peter's withdrawal from Gentile table fellowship under pressure from the circumcision party (v.12). The "works of the law" in view are the Jewish ceremonial identity markers (circumcision, food laws, separation) that the Judaizers were imposing. However, Paul universalizes the statement: "by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified." This broader statement applies to ALL law -- moral and ceremonial -- as a means of justification. The law (any law) cannot justify; only faith in Christ can. This is identical to Rom 3:20: "by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight."

**Cross-references:**
- Rom 3:20 (0.574 parallel) -- "by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified"
- Rom 3:28 (0.562 parallel) -- "a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law"
- Rom 3:31 -- After establishing that no one is justified by law-works, Paul asks: "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."

**Relation to Romans (law-16):** The parallel is exact. In both Romans and Galatians, Paul denies the law's ability to justify while affirming its ongoing validity. In Romans, Paul says faith establishes the law (3:31). In Galatians, Paul will say "all the law is fulfilled in one word...love thy neighbour" (5:14). In both epistles, the inability of law to justify does not mean the law is abolished -- it means the law was never designed to be a justification mechanism.

**Key observation:** Paul says the law CANNOT justify. He does not say the law is abolished. These are two different claims. A standard that defines righteousness without being able to produce it is not thereby nullified -- it still defines what is right. A medical test that diagnoses disease but cannot cure it is not thereby useless.

**Evidence classification:** Neutral. Both positions agree that no one is justified by works of the law. The verse addresses the law's inability to justify, which is common ground. It does not address whether the moral law continues as a standard of conduct.

### Galatians 3:10-14 -- The Curse of the Law and Christ's Redemption

> **3:10** "For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them."
> **3:11** "But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith."
> **3:12** "And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them."
> **3:13** "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:"
> **3:14** "That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."

**Context:** Paul continues his argument against justification by law-works. He has just appealed to the Galatians' own experience (3:1-5) and to Abraham's example (3:6-9). Now he addresses the consequence of pursuing justification through law-obedience.

**Direct statement (v.10):** Those who rely on "works of the law" are under a curse because no one perfectly continues in ALL things written in "the book of the law" (en to biblio tou nomou). Paul quotes Deut 27:26 (LXX).

**Direct statement (v.11):** No one is justified by the law in God's sight. The just live by faith (quoting Hab 2:4).

**Direct statement (v.12):** The law operates on a different principle than faith -- "the man that doeth them shall live in them" (quoting Lev 18:5). Law demands perfect obedience; faith trusts in God's promise.

**Direct statement (v.13):** Christ redeemed us FROM THE CURSE of the law (ek tes kataras tou nomou), not from the law itself. He became a curse for us (quoting Deut 21:23).

**Direct statement (v.14):** The purpose: that Abraham's blessing reaches the Gentiles through Christ, and that believers receive the promised Spirit through faith.

**Greek grammar insights:**
- v.10: "en to biblio tou nomou" = "in the BOOK of the law" -- the phrase "book of the law" in the OT typically refers to the Mosaic code as a whole, especially Deuteronomy (where Paul's quotation originates). The curses of Deut 27-28 encompass both moral and ceremonial commands.
- v.10: katara (G2671) = "curse" -- hypo kataran = "under a curse." The curse is the consequence of failing to keep the law perfectly, not the law itself.
- v.13: exagorazo (G1805) = "redeemed/bought out" -- Aorist Active Indicative (completed action). Christ redeemed us "ek tes kataras" -- OUT OF THE CURSE. The preposition ek with the genitive specifies what we were redeemed FROM: the curse, not the law. The text does not say Christ redeemed us from the law.
- v.13: genomenos hyper hemon katara = "having become a curse for us" -- Christ bore the curse-penalty.

**Which "law" is being addressed?** The phrase "book of the law" (v.10) encompasses the broad Mosaic code. Paul's argument is about the law AS A JUSTIFICATION SYSTEM: if you try to be justified by doing the law, you fall under its curse because no one can do it perfectly. The problem is not the law's content but the attempt to use it as a means of earning righteousness. Christ did not remove the law; He removed the CURSE that falls on those who fail to keep it.

**Cross-references:**
- Deut 27:26 -- The source quotation. The curses of Deut 27-28 are covenant sanctions for disobedience.
- Hab 2:4 -- "The just shall live by his faith." Faith has always been the means of right relationship with God.
- Lev 18:5 -- Perfect obedience is the law's operating principle. No fallen human achieves this.
- Deut 21:23 -- Cursed is he who hangs on a tree. Christ bore the covenant curse.
- Rom 8:3-4 -- "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son...condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us." The law's inability to justify through the flesh is resolved not by abolishing the law but by Christ enabling its fulfillment.
- Law-08 finding (E252): "Christ hath redeemed us from the CURSE of the law" -- the text says Christ redeemed from the curse, not from the law itself.

**Relation to Romans:** Identical argument structure. In Romans, the law cannot justify (3:20), but faith establishes the law (3:31), and the law's righteousness is fulfilled in Spirit-walkers (8:4). In Galatians, the law cannot justify (3:11), Christ removes the curse (3:13), but the law is fulfilled in love (5:14).

**Evidence classification:**
- v.10 (under the curse): Neutral -- both sides agree that imperfect obedience brings curse
- v.11 (not justified by law): Neutral -- both sides agree the law cannot justify
- v.13 (redeemed from the CURSE): Neutral -- the text says redeemed from the curse, not from the law. Both sides agree Christ bore the penalty for sin. The text does NOT say the law was abolished; it says the curse was removed.

### Galatians 3:19 -- "Added Because of Transgressions"

> "Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator."

**Context:** Paul has established that justification comes through faith and the Abrahamic promise, not through law (3:6-18). He now anticipates an objection: if justification is by promise, what is the law's purpose?

**Direct statement:** The law was (1) added (prosetethē) because of transgressions, (2) until the seed (Christ) should come, (3) ordained by angels, (4) in the hand of a mediator.

**Greek grammar insights:**
- prosetethē (prostithēmi, G4369) = "it was added" -- Aorist PASSIVE Indicative. The passive voice indicates the law was added by God. The word prostithēmi means "to place alongside, to add to" -- the law was added TO something already existing (the Abrahamic promise/covenant). This is significant: the law supplemented the promise; it did not replace it.
- parabaseon charin = "because of transgressions" -- charin (G5484) is a preposition meaning "on account of." The law was added on account of transgressions -- either to reveal them, to restrain them, or to define them. Rom 4:15 ("where no law is, there is no transgression") and Rom 5:20 ("the law entered, that the offence might abound") support the "to reveal/define" reading.
- achris an elthē to sperma = "until the seed should come" -- temporal limit with Aorist Active Subjunctive. The seed is Christ (per 3:16).
- diatageis di' angelon en cheiri mesitou = "having been ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator." The law came through intermediaries (angels and Moses), unlike the promise which came directly from God to Abraham.

**Which "law" is being addressed?** This is the critical question. Several indicators suggest Paul refers primarily to the Mosaic legal system as a custodial/revelatory institution, not specifically to the moral law content:

1. "Added" (prostithēmi) -- the law was added to a pre-existing arrangement (the Abrahamic promise). The moral principles of the Decalogue existed before Sinai (law-02 established this: Gen 26:5; Exo 16:28; murder, theft, adultery recognized as sin before Sinai). What was "added" at Sinai was the codified system -- the formal written law with its penalties, ceremonies, and civil ordinances.

2. "In the hand of a mediator" -- this phrase connects to the ceremonial/civil legislation delivered through Moses (Deu 5:31; Lev 1:1; 26:46). Law-03 and law-04 established that the Decalogue was spoken directly by God's voice to the people (Exo 20:1; Deu 5:22), while the additional legislation came "by the hand of Moses" (Lev 26:46). The phrase "in the hand of a mediator" more naturally fits the mediated legislation.

3. "Ordained by angels" -- Acts 7:53 and Heb 2:2 connect angelic involvement with the Sinai event broadly. However, the law-03 study showed that the Decalogue was spoken by God directly and written by God's own finger, while the additional laws came through mediated delivery.

4. "Till the seed should come" -- This temporal limitation. If applied to the moral law (Decalogue), this would mean the moral law ceased at Christ's coming. But Paul himself, writing AFTER Christ's coming, calls the law "holy, just, and good" (Rom 7:12), "spiritual" (Rom 7:14), and says faith "establishes" the law (Rom 3:31), quotes Decalogue commandments as the standard love fulfills (Rom 13:9), and says the law's righteousness is to be fulfilled in believers (Rom 8:4). Paul's own post-cross treatment of the moral law contradicts reading "till the seed should come" as ending the Decalogue. This temporal limitation fits the custodial/pedagogical function of the law system or the ceremonial/civil system that pointed to Christ.

**Cross-references:**
- Rom 5:20 -- "The law entered [pareiserchomai -- came alongside], that the offence might abound." Same "supplementary" language.
- Acts 7:53 -- "Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it."
- Heb 2:2 -- "The word spoken by angels was stedfast."
- Rom 4:15 -- "Where no law is, there is no transgression."
- Gal 3:17 -- The law came 430 years after the promise and cannot disannul it. The law supplemented but did not replace the promise-covenant.

**Relation to Romans:** In Romans, Paul establishes that the law entered to make sin apparent (Rom 5:20; 7:7-13) and that faith establishes the law (3:31). The supplementary, revelatory function of the law (making transgression visible) is consistent across both epistles. The critical difference: in Romans, Paul explicitly defends the law's ongoing moral authority after arguing against its justificatory power. In Galatians, Paul makes a similar move in 5:14 (law fulfilled in love) and 5:19-21 (works of the flesh violate moral law content).

**Evidence classification:** Neutral. The referent of "the law" in this verse is ambiguous (E058 in master evidence). It could refer to the whole Mosaic system as a custodial arrangement, the added ceremonial/civil legislation, or the law as a justification mechanism. The temporal clause "till the seed should come" creates a genuine interpretive question. Per Gate 1 of Tree 3, the referent is ambiguous. Prior study law-08 already classified this as Neutral (E058).

### Galatians 3:24-25 -- The Law as Schoolmaster/Paidagogos

> **3:24** "Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith."
> **3:25** "But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."

**Context:** Paul has argued that the law was added until the seed came (v.19), the law cannot give life or produce righteousness (v.21), Scripture concluded all under sin (v.22), and before faith came, "we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed" (v.23). Now he provides the metaphor explaining the law's pre-Christ function.

**Direct statement (v.24):** The law functioned as a paidagogos leading us toward Christ, with the PURPOSE (hina) of justification by faith.

**Direct statement (v.25):** After "the faith" (tēs pisteōs -- with article, referring to the Christian faith era) has come, we are no longer under a paidagogos.

**Greek grammar insights:**
- paidagogos (G3807) = NOT "schoolmaster" (misleading KJV translation). The paidagogos was a household slave in Greco-Roman culture who supervised a child, escorted him to school, and maintained discipline. The paidagogos was NOT the teacher. The role was custodial and temporary -- it ended when the child reached maturity ("the time appointed of the father," 4:2).
- gegonen (ginomai) = "has become" -- Perfect Active Indicative (completed state). The law has functioned as paidagogos.
- eis Christon = "unto Christ" -- directional. The paidagogos leads TOWARD the teacher (Christ), not away from the destination.
- hina ek pisteos dikaiothōmen = "so that from faith we might be justified" -- Purpose clause. The paidagogos's PURPOSE was to bring us to faith-justification.
- elthousēs tēs pisteōs = "the faith having come" -- Genitive Absolute (Aorist Active Participle). "The faith" (with article) = the faith-era inaugurated by Christ.
- hypo paidagogon = "under a paidagogos" -- The child is no longer under custodial supervision.

**Which "law" is being addressed?** The paidagogos metaphor describes a FUNCTION of the law, not a statement about its abolition. Several critical observations:

1. When a child grows up and no longer needs the paidagogos, the paidagogos has not been abolished or destroyed. The child has matured beyond the need for that custodial relationship. The paidagogos's principles (moral instruction) remain valid even though the supervisory arrangement has ended.

2. The function described is custodial and preparatory: the law kept Israel in a supervised state until Christ came. This custodial function included the entire Mosaic system -- moral law defining sin, ceremonial law pointing to Christ typologically, civil law maintaining Israel as a distinct nation.

3. "No longer under a schoolmaster" does not mean "no longer bound by moral standards." A grown adult who no longer has a babysitter is still expected to behave morally. Paul makes exactly this point in 5:13-14: "use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."

4. The parallel with Rom 10:4 ("Christ is the telos of the law") is significant. Telos can mean "goal/purpose." The law's paidagogos function had Christ as its goal. The law led TO Christ; now that Christ has come, the law's custodial function is fulfilled, but the moral content the law teaches remains.

**Cross-references:**
- Gal 4:1-7 -- Continues the metaphor: the heir as a child is under "tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father" (4:2). When the time came, God sent His Son "to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons" (4:4-5). The transition is from minor-child status to adult-son status, not from moral standards to no standards.
- Rom 10:4 -- "Christ is the end [telos/goal] of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth." Same directional concept: the law points to Christ.
- 1 Cor 9:21 -- Paul says he is "not without law to God, but under the law to Christ" (ennomos Christou). Even after the paidagogos era, Paul considers himself under law to Christ.

**Relation to Romans:** In Romans, Paul similarly describes a changed relationship to the law ("dead to the law," 7:4; "delivered from the law," 7:6) while immediately defending the law as "holy, just, good, spiritual" (7:12, 14) and delighting in it (7:22). The pattern is identical: the believer's RELATIONSHIP to the law changes (from condemnation/custody to freedom/adoption), but the law's moral content does not change.

**Evidence classification:** Neutral. The referent of "the law" as paidagogos is ambiguous (E059 in master evidence). It could refer to the whole Mosaic system in its custodial function, or specifically to the ceremonial/civil system. The statement "no longer under a schoolmaster" could mean the moral law is abolished (Abolished reading) or that the custodial arrangement has ended while moral content continues (Continues reading). Both readings are possible from this verse alone. Prior study law-08 classified this as Neutral (E059).

### Galatians 4:9-10 -- Weak and Beggarly Elements

> **4:9** "But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?"
> **4:10** "Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years."

**Context:** Paul has described the Galatians' pre-Christian state: "when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods" (4:8). The Galatians were Gentile pagans before conversion. Now they are turning to "weak and beggarly elements" (stoicheia) -- and Paul says they are turning "AGAIN" (palin) to bondage. This "again" is highly significant: the Galatians are returning to something similar to what they had before -- external religious rituals that cannot save.

**Direct statement (v.9):** The Galatians are turning to "weak and beggarly elements" (asthenē kai ptōcha stoicheia) and desiring to be "again" (palin anōthen) in bondage to them.

**Direct statement (v.10):** The specific practice Paul condemns: "Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years."

**Greek grammar insights:**
- epistrephete (epistrephō) = "you turn" -- Present Active Indicative (ongoing action, not completed)
- palin anōthen = "again anew" / "again from the beginning" -- double emphasis on repetition/regression
- stoicheion (G4747) = "elements/rudiments" -- modified by asthenē (weak) and ptōcha (beggarly/poor). These elements are characterized as powerless and impoverished.
- douleusai (douleuō) = "to be enslaved to" -- Aorist Active Infinitive
- paratēreisthe (paratēreō, G3906) = "scrupulously observe" -- Present Middle Indicative (ongoing, careful observance)
- Four categories in v.10: hēmeras (days), mēnas (months), kairous (seasons/times), eniautous (years)

**Which "law" is being addressed?** The "weak and beggarly elements" cannot refer to the moral law (Decalogue) for several reasons:

1. The Galatians were formerly Gentile pagans (4:8). They had never observed the Mosaic law. The word "again" (palin) means they are returning to something LIKE their former bondage. Pagan religious observance and Jewish ceremonial observance share the characteristic of external ritual performance as a means of gaining divine favor. The moral law (do not murder, do not steal, do not commit adultery) has no parallel in pagan bondage -- but calendrical observances do.

2. The specific practices in v.10 -- "days, months, times, years" -- correspond to the ceremonial calendar: holy days (feast days), new moons (monthly celebrations), set times/seasons (annual feasts), and years (sabbatical/jubilee years). This matches Col 2:16 ("holydays, new moon, sabbath days") exactly.

3. Paul calls these "weak and beggarly" -- powerless and impoverished. He never uses such language for the moral law, which he calls "holy, just, good, spiritual" (Rom 7:12, 14) and a "perfect law of liberty" (Jas 1:25, parallel from James).

4. The context is the Judaizers' program of imposing ceremonial requirements on Gentile converts. The "days, months, times, years" are the ceremonial calendar the Judaizers demanded.

**Cross-references:**
- Col 2:8, 20 -- Same phrase "rudiments (stoicheia) of the world" in a context discussing "handwriting of ordinances" (2:14) and "meat, drink, holyday, new moon, sabbath days" (2:16). The parallel context confirms stoicheia refers to the ceremonial system.
- Col 2:16-17 -- "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: Which are a shadow of things to come."
- Heb 9:10 -- "Carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation."

**Relation to Romans:** This passage has no direct Romans parallel. In Romans, Paul does not address ceremonial calendrical observance. However, Rom 14:5-6 ("One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike") touches on a related concern about Jewish/Gentile disputes over observances, though in a less polemical register.

**Evidence classification:** Neutral. The "days, months, times, years" are ceremonial calendar observances. Both positions agree that the ceremonial calendar is no longer binding (common ground per methodology). This passage does not address the moral law/Decalogue.

**Important distinction regarding the weekly Sabbath:** The weekly Sabbath is a Decalogue commandment grounded in creation (Gen 2:2-3; Exo 20:8-11), not a ceremonial feast. The "days" in Gal 4:10 -- in the context of ceremonial calendar observance alongside months, times, and years -- most naturally refers to ceremonial holy days, not the weekly Sabbath. The weekly Sabbath predates Sinai (Exo 16:23-29) and predates the ceremonial system, being grounded in creation week. However, this verse alone does not definitively resolve which "days" are meant -- the referent is contextually pointed toward ceremonial days but not lexically exclusive.

### Galatians 5:1-6 -- Stand Fast in Liberty; Circumcision

> **5:1** "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."
> **5:2** "Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing."
> **5:3** "For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law."
> **5:4** "Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace."
> **5:5** "For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith."
> **5:6** "For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love."

**Context:** Paul has just concluded the Hagar/Sarah allegory (4:21-31), which identifies two covenants: one from Sinai "which gendereth to bondage" (Hagar) and one that "is free" (Sarah/Jerusalem above). Paul now draws the practical conclusion: stand in the freedom Christ provides.

**Direct statement (v.1):** Christ has set believers free. They should stand firm and not be entangled again in a yoke of bondage.

**Direct statement (v.2):** If the Galatians submit to circumcision (as a salvation requirement), Christ profits them nothing.

**Direct statement (v.3):** Anyone who is circumcised (in this context: as a salvation requirement) is obligated to the WHOLE law. If you enter the law-system for justification, you must keep it all perfectly (cf. 3:10).

**Direct statement (v.4):** Those seeking justification BY the law have fallen from grace. Grace and law-justification are mutually exclusive methods.

**Direct statement (v.5):** Believers through the Spirit await the hope of righteousness by faith.

**Direct statement (v.6):** In Christ, circumcision and uncircumcision are both irrelevant. What matters is "faith which worketh by love" (pistis di' agapēs energoumenē).

**Greek grammar insights:**
- ēleutherōsen (eleutheroō, G1659) = "set free" -- Aorist Active Indicative (completed action by Christ)
- stēkete = "stand firm" -- Present Active IMPERATIVE (command)
- enechesthe = "be entangled" -- Present Passive IMPERATIVE (negative command with mē)
- zygos douleias = "yoke of slavery/bondage" -- the "yoke" is specifically circumcision and the entire ceremonial system required for justification
- v.6: pistis di' agapēs energoumenē = "faith working through love" -- Present Middle/Passive Participle. Faith is not passive; it is active through love.

**Which "law" is being addressed?** The text explicitly identifies the issue: CIRCUMCISION (vv.2-3, 6). The "yoke of bondage" (v.1) is the Judaizers' demand for circumcision and ceremonial law-keeping as a prerequisite for salvation. Paul's argument is:

1. Circumcision is the specific ceremonial practice at stake (vv.2, 3, 6, 11)
2. If you adopt circumcision for justification, you must do the WHOLE law (v.3) -- you cannot pick and choose from the law-system as a justification mechanism
3. The whole enterprise of law-justification (whether moral or ceremonial law) is incompatible with grace (v.4)
4. What matters is faith working through love (v.6)

The "whole law" in v.3 is the entire Mosaic system viewed as a justification mechanism. Paul's point is not about keeping the moral law as a standard of conduct (which he affirms in 5:14) but about relying on the law-system for justification.

**The critical parallel -- 1 Cor 7:19:** "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God." Paul dismisses the very ceremonial rite the Galatians are being pressured into while AFFIRMING "the commandments of God" (entolē tou theou). This is the same Paul, writing during the same period, making an explicit distinction between circumcision (ceremonial, dismissed) and commandments of God (moral, affirmed). This parallel from the same author is decisive: Paul does not treat all law as one undifferentiated unit.

**Cross-references:**
- Acts 15:10 -- Peter calls the circumcision/law-keeping requirement "a yoke...which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear."
- 1 Cor 7:19 -- "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God" (E143)
- Gal 6:15 -- "Neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature."
- John 8:36 -- "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."

**Relation to Romans:** Rom 6:14-15: "ye are not under the law, but under grace...shall we sin? God forbid." Same structure: freedom from the law as a condemnation/justification system does not mean freedom to sin. The liberty Paul describes is liberty FROM the law's condemning and justificatory function, not liberty FROM moral obligation.

**Evidence classification:**
- v.1 (liberty from yoke of bondage): Neutral. The "yoke of bondage" is identified by context as the Judaizers' circumcision requirement. Both sides agree circumcision is not required.
- v.2-3 (circumcision, whole law): Neutral. Circumcision cessation is common ground.
- v.4 (justified by law = fallen from grace): Neutral. Both sides agree no one is justified by law.
- v.6 (faith working by love): Continues. V1: "faith which worketh by love" echoes the law-continuation pattern -- love is the fulfillment of the law (5:14; Rom 13:8-10). Faith is not antinomian; it works through love, and love fulfills the law's moral content. Gate 1: PASS -- "love" in Galatians is identified by 5:14 as love that fulfills the law (quoting Lev 19:18). Gate 2: PASS -- pistis di' agapēs energoumenē is grammatically clear. Gate 3: PASS -- didactic epistle. Gate 4: PASS -- consistent with E028 (love fulfills Decalogue), E143 (commandments of God).

### Galatians 5:14 -- "All the Law Is Fulfilled in One Word"

> "For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."

**Context:** Paul has just warned against using liberty as an occasion for the flesh (v.13) and urged: "by love serve one another." Now he provides the basis: THE ENTIRE LAW (ho pas nomos) is fulfilled in the love command.

**Direct statement:** The entire law is fulfilled (peplērotai) in the command "Love thy neighbour as thyself" (quoting Lev 19:18).

**Greek grammar insights:**
- ho pas nomos = "THE ENTIRE law" -- with article (ho) and pas (all/every). This is comprehensive: ALL the law, not just part of it.
- peplērotai (plēroō, G4137) = "has been fulfilled" -- Perfect Passive Indicative (completed state with ongoing result). The law HAS BEEN (and continues to be) fulfilled in the love command. Plēroō means "to fill up, make full, complete" -- the law is filled to the brim by love. This is NOT kataluō (destroy/abolish). The law is not abolished; it is filled/fulfilled.
- The quotation is from Lev 19:18 (LXX) -- a command from the Torah itself. Paul uses the Torah to interpret the Torah.

**Which "law" is being addressed?** Paul says "ALL the law" (ho pas nomos). This is a statement about the moral content of the entire law: love is the principle that fulfills every moral command. This is not a statement about ceremonial or civil law.

**The decisive parallel -- Rom 13:8-10:** Paul makes the identical argument in Romans but with MORE detail:
- "He that loveth another hath fulfilled the law" (13:8)
- "Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (13:9)
- "Love is the fulfilling [pleroma] of the law" (13:10)

In Romans, Paul SPECIFIES which commandments love fulfills: the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th Decalogue commandments. The "law" that love fulfills is the moral law/Decalogue. This is verified SIS (#4a): same author, same argument, same quotation (Lev 19:18), with Romans providing the specific content that Galatians summarizes.

**Cross-references:**
- Rom 13:8-10 (0.497 parallel for 13:10; 0.487 for 13:9; 0.478 for 13:8) -- The strongest parallels confirm identical argument
- Jas 2:8 (0.514 parallel) -- "If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well." James calls the love command "the royal law" and connects it to Decalogue commands (2:10-12: "Do not commit adultery...Do not kill").
- Mat 22:39 -- Jesus' second great commandment: "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
- Rom 8:4 -- "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Same plēroō root -- the law is FULFILLED (not abolished) in believers.

**Relation to Romans:** This is the Galatians counterpart to Rom 13:8-10. The argument is identical: love fulfills the law. In Romans, Paul specifies the content as Decalogue commandments. In Galatians, the summary form is used. The implications are the same: the law continues as the standard that love fulfills. If the law were abolished, there would be nothing for love to fulfill.

**Evidence classification:** Continues. V1: "all the law is fulfilled in one word...Thou shalt love thy neighbour" uses law-continuation vocabulary -- the law is fulfilled (plēroō), not abolished (kataluō). Love fills the law; the law remains as the container that love fills. Gate 1: PASS -- "all the law" (ho pas nomos) is identified by the Romans parallel as the moral law/Decalogue (same author, same quotation, same argument). Gate 2: PASS -- peplērotai (Perfect Passive) is unambiguous: "has been and continues to be fulfilled." Gate 3: PASS -- didactic epistle. Gate 4: PASS -- consistent with E028 (love fulfills Decalogue), E401/E408 (pleroma of law in Rom 13:10).

### Galatians 5:18 -- "Not Under the Law"

> "But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law."

**Context:** Paul has just contrasted the flesh and the Spirit (vv.16-17): "Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh." Then v.18: if the Spirit leads you, you are not under the law.

**Direct statement:** Spirit-led believers are not "under the law" (hypo nomon).

**Greek grammar insights:**
- ei de Pneumati agesthe = "if by the Spirit you are led" -- First class conditional (assumes truth for argument). Pneumati = dative of means.
- hypo nomon = "under law" -- NO ARTICLE on nomon (anarthrous). This is significant: Paul says "under law" as a principle/system, not "under THE law" specifically. The same anarthrous construction appears in Rom 6:14 ("hypo nomon").
- The construction is parallel: led by Spirit = NOT under law. The Spirit and law-as-condemnation are counterposed, not Spirit and law-as-moral-standard.

**Which "law" is being addressed?** "Under the law" (hypo nomon) in Paul refers to being under the law's jurisdiction as a condemning, justifying, or custodial system -- not under the law's moral authority. Multiple indicators:

1. The immediate context (vv.19-23) is decisive. After saying "not under the law," Paul immediately lists "the works of the flesh" (vv.19-21): "adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings." These include violations of the Decalogue (adultery = 7th commandment, murder = 6th commandment, idolatry = 1st/2nd commandments). Paul says "they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God" (v.21). If "not under the law" meant the moral law is abolished, Paul could not immediately condemn violations of its content.

2. The fruit of the Spirit (vv.22-23) -- "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law." The Spirit produces moral character that the law does not condemn. The Spirit and the moral law are not opposed -- they agree. The Spirit produces what the law requires.

3. Gal 5:14 (just four verses earlier) -- "all the law is fulfilled in one word...love thy neighbour." Paul has JUST affirmed the law's moral content through love. He is not contradicting himself four verses later.

4. Rom 6:14-15 parallel -- "ye are not under the law, but under grace. What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid." Paul asks and emphatically denies that "not under the law" permits sin. If "not under the law" meant the moral law is abolished, sin (defined as law-transgression, 1 John 3:4) would be meaningless.

**Cross-references:**
- Rom 6:14-15 (0.426 parallel for 6:14) -- Identical phrase, identical meaning. Paul denies that "not under law" permits sin.
- Rom 8:4 (0.410 parallel) -- "the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Spirit-walking fulfills the law's righteousness.
- 1 Cor 9:21 -- "not being without law to God, but under the law to Christ" (ennomos Christou). Paul is not anomos (lawless) toward God; he is ennomos (in-lawed) to Christ. Even while "not under the law" as a justification system, Paul considers himself under law to Christ.

**Relation to Romans:** Law-16 (I103) established that "not under the law" (Rom 6:14; Gal 5:18) refers to freedom from the law's condemning jurisdiction, not freedom from its moral authority. The evidence: Rom 6:15 (shall we sin? God forbid!), Rom 8:1 (no condemnation), and Paul's continued citation of the law as the righteousness standard (8:4; 13:8-10). The same interpretation applies in Galatians: "not under the law" means not under its condemnation/custody, consistent with the paidagogos metaphor of 3:24-25.

**Evidence classification:** Neutral. V2: "not under the law" is cessation-adjacent vocabulary. Gate 1: FAIL -- "under the law" (hypo nomon) has a semantic range: (a) under the law's condemning power, (b) under the law's authority entirely. The immediate context (vv.19-21 condemn Decalogue violations; v.14 affirms law through love) and the Romans parallel (6:15: "shall we sin? God forbid") support reading (a). Reclassification: RC1: Referent of "under the law" is ambiguous. RC2: Corrected: "Not under the law's condemnation/custody but led by the Spirit." RC3: Neither continuation nor cessation vocabulary applies to condemnation status. Neutral.

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Circumcision Is the Specific Issue, Not the Moral Law
Throughout Galatians, the concrete issue Paul opposes is circumcision and the ceremonial system imposed by the Judaizers:
- 2:3-4 -- Titus not compelled to be circumcised
- 2:12 -- Peter feared the circumcision party
- 5:2-3 -- If circumcised, Christ profits nothing
- 5:6 -- Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, but faith working by love
- 5:11 -- Paul does not preach circumcision
- 6:12-13 -- Those constraining circumcision do not themselves keep the law
- 6:15 -- Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, but new creature

Paul never names a Decalogue commandment as what he opposes. He names circumcision repeatedly.

### Pattern 2: Paul Affirms the Moral Law's Content Even While Opposing Law-Justification
- 5:14 -- "All the law is fulfilled in one word...love thy neighbour" (quoting Lev 19:18)
- 5:19-21 -- The "works of the flesh" include Decalogue violations (adultery, murder, idolatry) that exclude from God's kingdom
- 5:22-23 -- The "fruit of the Spirit" produces what the law requires: "against such there is no law"
- 6:2 -- "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ" -- the "law of Christ" involves moral obligation, not lawlessness
- 1 Cor 7:19 -- Same author: "Circumcision is nothing...but the keeping of the commandments of God"

### Pattern 3: The Law Cannot Justify -- This Is Not the Same as Abolition
- 2:16 -- Not justified by works of the law
- 3:11 -- No man is justified by the law
- 3:21 -- If a law could give life, righteousness would be by the law
- 5:4 -- Justified by the law = fallen from grace

These statements are about the law's INABILITY TO JUSTIFY, not about its abolition as a moral standard. In Romans, Paul makes the identical argument (3:20) and then immediately asks "Do we make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law" (3:31).

### Pattern 4: "Under the Law" = Under Its Condemnation/Custody, Not Under Its Moral Authority
- 3:23 -- "Kept under the law" -- custodial function (pre-faith)
- 3:25 -- "No longer under a schoolmaster" -- custodial arrangement ended
- 4:4-5 -- "Made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law" -- Christ entered the law's jurisdiction to free those condemned by it
- 5:18 -- "Not under the law" -- Spirit-led believers not under law's condemnation

In every case, the context shows "under the law" refers to the law's condemning/custodial jurisdiction, not to the moral law's continuing authority.

### Pattern 5: The Absence of dogma (G1378) in Galatians
The primary NT abolition vocabulary -- dogma (G1378), used in Col 2:14 and Eph 2:15 to specify what was "nailed to the cross" and "abolished" -- does NOT appear in Galatians. Paul uses nomos throughout Galatians but never employs the specific vocabulary he uses elsewhere when identifying ceremonial ordinances for abolition. This absence is notable: when Paul explicitly identifies what was abolished in Colossians and Ephesians, he uses dogma; in Galatians, where the issue is law-justification and circumcision, he does not use abolition vocabulary for the law itself.

## Connections Between Passages

### The Galatians-Romans Arc
Paul's argument in Galatians and Romans forms a coherent whole:

1. **No justification by law** -- Gal 2:16 = Rom 3:20
2. **The curse/condemnation removed** -- Gal 3:13 (redeemed from curse) = Rom 8:1 (no condemnation)
3. **Law had a custodial/revelatory function** -- Gal 3:24 (paidagogos) = Rom 7:7 (by the law is the knowledge of sin)
4. **Not under the law** -- Gal 5:18 = Rom 6:14 (both deny this permits sin)
5. **Love fulfills the law** -- Gal 5:14 = Rom 13:8-10 (both quote Lev 19:18)
6. **Faith establishes the law** -- Rom 3:31 (explicit in Romans, implicit in Galatians through 5:14)
7. **The Spirit enables what the law requires** -- Gal 5:16-23 (Spirit vs. flesh) = Rom 8:4 (Spirit fulfills law's dikaioma)

The two epistles are complementary. Galatians is polemical (fighting the Judaizers), so Paul emphasizes what the law CANNOT do (justify). Romans is systematic (laying out the whole gospel), so Paul balances what the law cannot do (justify, 3:20) with what the law IS (holy/just/good/spiritual, 7:12-14) and what the Spirit enables (law-fulfillment, 8:4; 13:8-10).

### The 1 Corinthians 7:19 Bridge
Paul's statement in 1 Cor 7:19 -- "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God" -- provides the bridge between the Galatians argument and the Romans argument. This single verse:
- Dismisses the ceremonial rite (circumcision) that is the Galatians issue
- Affirms the moral commandments (entolē tou theou) that Paul expounds in Romans
- Demonstrates that Paul DOES distinguish between ceremonial and moral law

## Word Study Insights

### nomos in Galatians -- Multiple Senses
Following the finding of law-16 (N080) that Paul uses nomos in at least four senses, the ~32 occurrences of nomos in Galatians can be categorized:

1. **The law as a justification system** -- 2:16 (x3), 2:21, 3:2, 3:5, 3:10a, 3:11, 3:18, 3:21a, 5:4 -- Paul argues no one is justified by the law
2. **The Mosaic code/system as a historical institution** -- 3:10b ("book of the law"), 3:17, 3:19, 3:23, 3:24, 4:4, 4:5, 4:21, 5:3 -- the law as a historical arrangement from Sinai to Christ
3. **The law's moral content** -- 5:14 ("all the law is fulfilled in love"), 5:23 ("against such there is no law"), 6:2 ("law of Christ")
4. **The law as a cursing/condemning agent** -- 3:13 ("curse of the law"), 5:18 ("under the law")

Paul's negative statements about the law cluster in senses #1 (cannot justify) and #4 (condemns). His positive statement about the law is in sense #3 (moral content fulfilled by love). This distinction within Galatians mirrors the distinction found in Romans.

### paidagogos -- Custodial, Not Abolition Vocabulary
The paidagogos metaphor (3:24-25) describes a temporary supervisory FUNCTION, not the destruction of moral content. The paidagogos's rules for the child were not wrong -- they were appropriate for the child's stage of development. The adult who no longer needs the paidagogos has not rejected the moral principles; he has internalized them.

### exagorazo -- Redeemed from the CURSE, Not from the Law
Christ redeemed (exagorazo) us from the CURSE of the law (3:13), not from the law itself. The preposition ek with the genitive ("out of the curse") specifies the curse as what we were freed from. Christ also redeemed "them that were under the law" (4:5) -- freed them from the law's custodial jurisdiction.

---

## Difficult Passages

### Galatians 3:19 -- "Till the Seed Should Come"
This is the most challenging passage for the Continues position. If "till the seed should come" means the law's entire function has ended, the moral law would be included. However:
1. Paul himself continues to cite the law positively after Christ's coming (Rom 7:12, 14, 22; 13:8-10; Gal 5:14)
2. The "added" language (prostithēmi) suggests something supplementary was added, not that the foundational moral principles were temporary
3. "In the hand of a mediator" connects to the mediated legislation (ceremonial/civil) more naturally than to the Decalogue (spoken directly by God)
4. The temporal limit may refer to the law's custodial/condemning function ending, not to its moral content ending

This verse remains genuinely ambiguous (E058, Neutral).

### Galatians 4:21-31 -- Hagar/Sarah Allegory
Paul uses an allegory identifying Sinai with Hagar/bondage and the heavenly Jerusalem with Sarah/freedom. This could be read as casting the entire Sinai institution in a negative light. However:
1. Paul explicitly calls it an "allegory" (allegoreō, 4:24) -- he is using a typological reading, not a literal identification of Sinai = bad
2. The "bondage" of Sinai in context is the bondage of the law-as-justification-system, not the moral content of the Sinai legislation
3. Paul himself was present at Sinai's legislation (as a Torah-keeping Jew) and calls that law "holy, just, good, spiritual" (Rom 7:12, 14)
4. The contrast is between two covenant approaches (human works vs. divine promise), not between two moral systems

### Galatians 5:1 -- "Yoke of Bondage"
The "yoke of bondage" could be read as the moral law itself. But the immediate context (v.2) identifies the yoke as CIRCUMCISION -- the specific ceremonial requirement the Judaizers imposed. Acts 15:10 uses the same "yoke" language for the circumcision/law-of-Moses requirement demanded by Judaizers.
