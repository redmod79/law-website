# Bible Study: Paul and the Law in Galatians

## Question
What is Paul arguing in Galatians regarding the law? Investigate Gal 2:16 (not justified by works of the law), Gal 3:10-14 (curse of the law, Christ redeemed us), Gal 3:19 ("Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions"), Gal 3:24-25 (the law as schoolmaster/paidagogos -- "after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster"), Gal 4:9-10 (weak and beggarly elements, observing days/months/times/years), Gal 5:1-6 (stand fast in liberty, circumcision vs uncircumcision), Gal 5:14 ("all the law is fulfilled in one word... love thy neighbour"), Gal 5:18 ("if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law"). In each context, determine which "law" Paul is addressing -- the moral law, the ceremonial system, or the law as a means of justification.

**Key Findings from Related Study Conclusions:**

**law-16 (Paul and Law in Romans) -- Companion Study:**
- Paul identifies "the law" (nomos) with the Decalogue when he quotes specific content (Rom 7:7 = 10th command; Rom 13:9 = 6th-10th commands)
- The law is holy, just, good, and spiritual (Rom 7:12, 14)
- Faith establishes the law (Rom 3:31)
- The law cannot justify -- no flesh is justified by works of law (Rom 3:20, 28)
- Being "not under the law" does not permit sin (Rom 6:15)
- The righteous requirement (dikaioma) of the law is fulfilled in Spirit-walking believers (Rom 8:4)
- Paul uses nomos in at least four distinct senses: Torah/code, Decalogue specifically, operating principle, and Pentateuch as Scripture-witness
- When Paul specifies content by direct quotation, every citation is a Decalogue commandment
- Evidence items: E389-E408 (new), E010-E011, E024-E028, E037, E046, E060-E062, E089 (also-cited)
- Inferences I102-I107; I-B resolution: Strong against Abolished reading of Romans

**law-08 (Abolished at Cross):**
- The seven primary NT abolition passages each identify something different as abolished -- none explicitly names the Decalogue
- Gal 3:13: "Christ hath redeemed us from the CURSE of the law" -- the text says Christ redeemed from the curse, not from the law itself (E252)
- Gal 3:19: "It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come" -- referent of "the law" is ambiguous; could be whole Mosaic system or added ceremonial legislation (E058)
- Gal 3:24-25: "The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ" -- referent of "the law" is ambiguous (E059)
- dogma (G1378) is used in the two primary abolition texts (Col 2:14; Eph 2:15) and is never used for the Decalogue
- cheirographon means "hand-written" -- the Decalogue was written by "the finger of God"
- katargeo (G2673) is used to abolish one referent (dogma/ordinances in Eph 2:15) while emphatically denying abolition of another (nomos generally in Rom 3:31)

**law-04 (Ceremonial Laws):**
- Five categories: sacrifices, feasts, purity regulations, sanctuary service, and circumcision
- Ceremonial laws delivered through Moses as mediator (Gal 3:19: "in the hand of a mediator")
- Written by Moses in a book, placed beside the Ark
- "A shadow of good things to come" (Heb 10:1; Col 2:17)
- Paul states: "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God" (1 Cor 7:19, E143/E020)
- Circumcision is the ceremonial law most directly addressed in Galatians

### Focus Areas

Based on tool discoveries, the research should investigate these specific aspects:

1. **Identify which "law" in each Galatians passage** -- Using the nomos (G3551) semantic range established in law-16 (four senses), determine in each passage whether Paul addresses: (a) the moral law/Decalogue, (b) the ceremonial system (esp. circumcision), (c) the law as a justification mechanism, or (d) some combination
2. **Gal 2:16 -- "works of the law"** -- Compare with Rom 3:20,28. What does erga nomou mean? Is this the moral law's inability to justify, or specifically ceremonial observances as a justification strategy?
3. **Gal 3:10-14 -- Curse and redemption** -- The Nave's entry for LAW lists Gal 3:19 under "was given because of transgressions." Law-08 found that Gal 3:13 removes "the CURSE of the law," not the law itself (E252). Investigate exagorazo (G1805) and katara (G2671). What was the curse, and what was redeemed?
4. **Gal 3:19 -- "added because of transgressions"** -- Law-08 classified this as Neutral (referent ambiguous, E058). The Nave's LAW entry notes it was "received by the disposition of angels" and "in the hand of a mediator." Investigate: does "added" (prostithemi, G4369) indicate a supplementary law added to something pre-existing? Does "in the hand of a mediator" (Gal 3:19) connect to the ceremonial laws delivered through Moses (law-04 finding)?
5. **Gal 3:24-25 -- Paidagogos** -- Law-08 classified this as Neutral (referent ambiguous, E059). [G3807](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3807/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (paidagogos) appears only 3x in NT. What was the paidagogos role in Greco-Roman culture? Does "no longer under a schoolmaster" mean the law is abolished or that its guardian function is fulfilled?
6. **Gal 4:9-10 -- Stoicheia** -- [G4747](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4747/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (stoicheion) = "elements/rudiments." The observance of "days, and months, and times, and years" (4:10) matches the ceremonial calendar. Does this identify the "weak and beggarly elements" as the ceremonial system specifically?
7. **Gal 5:1-6 -- Liberty and circumcision** -- The CIRCUMCISION Nave's entry lists GAL 5:2-11 under "Abrogated" and notes "necessity of, falsely taught by Judaizing Christians" (ACT 15:1). [G1657](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1657/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (eleutheria) and [G2218](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2218/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (zugos, yoke). Compare with 1 Cor 7:19 (E143): "Circumcision is nothing...but the keeping of the commandments of God" -- Paul dismisses circumcision while affirming commandment-keeping
8. **Gal 5:14 -- "All the law is fulfilled in one word"** -- Compare with Rom 13:8-10 (E028/E407/E408), where Paul quotes five Decalogue commandments as the content love fulfills. Does Gal 5:14 confirm that the moral law (love thy neighbour) continues?
9. **Gal 5:18 -- "Not under the law"** -- Compare with Rom 6:14-15 (E394/E395). Law-16 found that "not under the law" in Romans means freedom from condemnation, not freedom from moral obligation (I103). Does the same apply in Galatians?
10. **Absence of dogma (G1378) in Galatians** -- The abolition texts in Col 2:14 and Eph 2:15 use dogma to specify what was abolished. This term does NOT appear in Galatians. Does Paul use different vocabulary in Galatians, and does this affect which "law" he means?
11. **Circumcision as the Galatian controversy** -- The Nave's CIRCUMCISION entry identifies the Galatian issue as the "necessity of [circumcision], falsely taught by Judaizing Christians" (ACT 15:1). Multiple verses (Gal 2:3-4; 5:2-11; 6:12-13) focus on circumcision. Investigate whether the "works of the law" in Galatians primarily refers to ceremonial observances (especially circumcision) as a justification strategy, rather than moral law obedience
12. **Hagar/Sarah allegory (Gal 4:21-31)** -- Listed in JUSTIFICATION entry. Investigate the two covenants as Paul presents them and what "the law" means in this allegory
