## Question
What is Paul arguing in Galatians regarding the law? Investigate Gal 2:16 (not justified by works of the law), Gal 3:10-14 (curse of the law, Christ redeemed us), Gal 3:19 ("Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions"), Gal 3:24-25 (the law as schoolmaster/paidagogos -- "after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster"), Gal 4:9-10 (weak and beggarly elements, observing days/months/times/years), Gal 5:1-6 (stand fast in liberty, circumcision vs uncircumcision), Gal 5:14 ("all the law is fulfilled in one word... love thy neighbour"), Gal 5:18 ("if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law"). In each context, determine which "law" Paul is addressing -- the moral law, the ceremonial system, or the law as a means of justification.

### Key Observations from Nave's
1. **LAW: TEMPORARY** -- Nave's lists GAL 2:3-9 and GAL 4:30,31 under the "TEMPORARY" subsection of LAW, alongside other passages about cessation of certain aspects of the law.
2. **LAW: "received by the disposition of angels...in the hand of a mediator"** -- GAL 3:19 is listed under both "divine authority" and "given because of transgressions."
3. **CIRCUMCISION: Abrogated** -- Nave's explicitly lists GAL 2:3,4; 5:2-11; 6:12 under "Abrogated" for circumcision.
4. **CIRCUMCISION: "Necessity of, falsely taught by Judaizing Christians"** -- ACT 15:1 identifies the specific controversy.
5. **JUSTIFICATION** -- All the Galatians justification passages (2:14-21; 3:6,8,9,11,21,22,24; 4:21-31; 5:4-6) are grouped together under justification.
6. **FAITH IN CHRIST** -- GAL 2:16 and 3:1-29 are listed specifically under "Faith in Christ," not merely general faith.
