# What Is Paul Arguing in Galatians Regarding the Law?

## A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence

---

The book of Galatians is one of the most frequently cited New Testament letters in discussions about whether God's moral law continues after the cross. Many readers come away from Galatians believing Paul taught that the entire law -- moral commandments and all -- was set aside when Christ came. But is that what the text actually says? This study examines every major passage in Galatians that addresses the law, paying careful attention to what Paul names as the problem, what he affirms, and what he condemns. The results reveal a more precise picture than is often assumed.

## The Controversy Paul Was Addressing

Understanding Galatians requires understanding the situation Paul was responding to. Paul was not writing an abstract theological essay about the law in general. He was confronting a specific crisis: a group of people (often called "Judaizers") had come into the Galatian churches and were telling Gentile believers that they needed to be circumcised and follow the Jewish ceremonial system in order to be saved.

Paul names this issue repeatedly throughout the letter. Circumcision appears as the focal point again and again:

> "But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised." (Galatians 2:3)

> "Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing." (Galatians 5:2)

> "For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love." (Galatians 5:6)

> "As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised...Neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh." (Galatians 6:12-13)

Every specific example Paul gives of what he opposes is circumcision or ceremonial observance -- never a moral commandment from the Ten Commandments. This is a consistent pattern throughout the entire letter.

## No One Is Justified by Works of the Law

One of Paul's central arguments in Galatians is that no human being can be made right with God by performing works of the law. This is stated with unmistakable clarity:

> "Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified." (Galatians 2:16)

> "But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith." (Galatians 3:11)

> "Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace." (Galatians 5:4)

Paul is unequivocal: the law cannot save anyone. Trying to earn salvation through law-keeping and grace through Christ are mutually exclusive paths. This is a point on which virtually all Bible-believing Christians agree.

However, saying the law cannot save is not the same as saying the law no longer exists as a moral standard. Paul makes this distinction clearly, as the following sections demonstrate.

## Redeemed from the Curse, Not from the Law Itself

One of the most important verses in this discussion is Galatians 3:13, and the precise wording matters:

> "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree." (Galatians 3:13)

Paul does not say Christ redeemed us "from the law." He says Christ redeemed us "from the curse of the law." The curse is the penalty that falls on those who fail to keep the law perfectly. Christ bore that penalty. The law's condemning power over believers has been broken, but the text carefully distinguishes between the law itself and the curse that the law pronounces on lawbreakers.

## The Schoolmaster and "Till the Seed Should Come"

Two passages in Galatians 3 are frequently cited as proof that the law was temporary and has now ended entirely:

> "Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made." (Galatians 3:19)

> "Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster." (Galatians 3:24-25)

These verses describe the law's role as a guardian or tutor (the Greek word is "paidagogos," a household servant who supervised children until they came of age). The question is whether "no longer under a schoolmaster" means the law was abolished entirely, or whether it means the custodial, supervisory arrangement ended while the moral principles remain.

The answer lies in what Paul says just two chapters later in the same letter. Writing well after Christ's coming, Paul affirms that the law is fulfilled in love (5:14) and condemns violations of the Ten Commandments (5:19-21). If Paul believed the moral law had ended at Christ's coming, it would be contradictory for him to affirm and enforce it in the same letter.

The "schoolmaster" illustration works much like a child growing into adulthood: the adult no longer needs a guardian standing over him, but the moral principles the guardian taught are not thrown away. They are now followed from an inward motivation rather than external compulsion.

## The "Weak and Beggarly Elements" and the "Yoke of Bondage"

Paul uses two vivid phrases that some readers apply to the moral law. But the text itself identifies what these phrases refer to:

> "But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years." (Galatians 4:9-10)

The "weak and beggarly elements" are identified by Paul himself in the very next verse as calendrical observances -- days, months, times, and years. These are ceremonial practices, not the moral law.

> "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage." (Galatians 5:1)

The "yoke of bondage" is identified by the very next verse as circumcision: "Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing" (5:2). Paul is not calling the Ten Commandments a yoke of bondage; he is calling the Judaizers' demand for circumcision a yoke of bondage.

## Paul Affirms the Moral Law Through Love

While Paul dismantles the ceremonial system and denies the law's power to justify, he simultaneously affirms the moral law's content. This is one of the most important findings of the study:

> "For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." (Galatians 5:14)

The word "fulfilled" here is the Greek word meaning "to fill up" or "to bring to completion" -- not "to abolish" or "to bring to an end." Paul is saying that love fills up the law, bringing its requirements to their full expression. The law remains as the container that love fills.

Additionally, Paul's description of faith itself points in the same direction:

> "For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love." (Galatians 5:6)

Faith is not passive or lawless. It works through love, and love is the fulfillment of the moral law. Circumcision is dismissed as irrelevant, but love -- which fulfills the law -- is affirmed as essential.

The same author reinforces this distinction with striking clarity in another letter:

> "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God." (1 Corinthians 7:19)

In a single sentence, Paul calls circumcision "nothing" while affirming that keeping God's commandments is what matters. This demonstrates that Paul does not treat all law as one undifferentiated unit. He distinguishes between ceremonial requirements (set aside) and moral commandments (affirmed).

## "Not Under the Law" Does Not Mean No Moral Standard

One of the most frequently quoted verses in this debate is Galatians 5:18:

> "But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law." (Galatians 5:18)

Taken in isolation, this could sound like the moral law has been entirely removed. But Paul's own immediate context makes that reading impossible. In the very next verses, he writes:

> "Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." (Galatians 5:19-21)

Paul lists sins that include direct violations of the Ten Commandments -- adultery (seventh commandment), murder (sixth commandment), idolatry (first and second commandments) -- and declares that people who practice these things will not inherit God's kingdom. He says this immediately after saying "ye are not under the law." Clearly, "not under the law" does not mean "free from moral obligation." It means believers are no longer under the law's condemning power, not that the law's moral content has been erased.

Paul then describes what the Spirit produces in believers' lives:

> "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law." (Galatians 5:22-23)

The phrase "against such there is no law" assumes the law still exists as a standard. The Spirit's fruit does not violate the law -- it fulfills it. The Spirit and the moral law are not in conflict; they work together.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

Honest study requires acknowledging what the text does not explicitly state:

- Galatians never names any of the Ten Commandments as abolished. Paul never says, "The commandment against adultery no longer applies," or "Idolatry is now permitted." Every moral commandment he mentions, he affirms.
- The phrase "not under the law" is never defined in Galatians as meaning "free from all moral obligation." The immediate context (condemning Decalogue violations) works against that reading.
- The "schoolmaster" passage does not explicitly say whether the moral content of the law ended or only the custodial arrangement. The metaphor is ambiguous on its own and must be read alongside Paul's clear affirmations of the law in the same letter.
- The text does not explicitly say "till the seed should come" means the Ten Commandments ended at Christ's arrival. Paul himself, writing after Christ, affirms the law through love and condemns its violations.
- Galatians does not say the "weak and beggarly elements" include the moral law. The text identifies them as calendrical observances.
- The text does not say the "yoke of bondage" is the Decalogue. It identifies it as circumcision.
- Paul does not say the law is replaced by a "law of love" as if love were something different from the law. He says the law IS fulfilled in love -- love is how the law is kept, not a substitute for it.

## Conclusion

Paul's argument in Galatians is directed against the Judaizers' demand that Gentile believers submit to circumcision and ceremonial requirements for salvation. He argues forcefully that the law cannot justify anyone and that Christ has freed believers from the law's curse and condemning power. At the same time, Paul affirms the moral law's content: it is fulfilled in love, its violations are condemned as excluding people from God's kingdom, and the Spirit produces character that is consistent with it. Paul distinguishes between the law as a means of earning salvation (rejected), the ceremonial system including circumcision (set aside as irrelevant), and the moral law's content (fulfilled through love by believers who are led by the Spirit). The three ambiguous passages in Galatians -- the schoolmaster metaphor, the "till the seed should come" phrase, and "not under the law" -- must be read in light of Paul's own plain statements in the same letter, where he affirms the law through love and condemns its violations. The letter to the Galatians does not abolish the moral law; it abolishes the attempt to use any law as a means of justification and sets aside the ceremonial system that the Judaizers were trying to impose.
