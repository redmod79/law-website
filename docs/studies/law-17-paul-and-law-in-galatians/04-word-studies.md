## paidagogos (G3807) -- "schoolmaster"
**Original:** paidagogos (Greek)
**Transliteration:** paidagogos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** From pais (child) and ago (to lead). A boy-leader, a servant who escorted children to school and supervised their conduct. NOT a teacher.
**BLB Count:** 3

### Translations in KJV (3 occurrences)
- "instructors" -- 1x (1 Cor 4:15)
- "schoolmaster" -- 1x (Gal 3:24)
- "a schoolmaster" -- 1x (Gal 3:25)

### Key Verses
- **1 Corinthians 4:15** -- "For though ye have ten thousand instructors [paidagogos] in Christ, yet [have ye] not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel."
- **Galatians 3:24** -- "Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [paidagogos] to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith."
- **Galatians 3:25** -- "But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster [paidagogos]."

### Notes
- The paidagogos was a trusted slave in Greco-Roman households who supervised a child until the child came of age. The role was custodial and disciplinary, not primarily educational.
- The KJV translation "schoolmaster" is somewhat misleading. The paidagogos did not teach; he conducted the child to the teacher and supervised behavior.
- The word appears only 3 times in the entire NT -- all in Paul.
- The role was temporary -- it ended when the child matured ("the time appointed of the father," Gal 4:2).

- **2 Pet 2:19** -- "they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption"

### Notes
- In Galatians, eleutheria appears 3 times (2:4; 5:1; 5:13), all in the context of freedom from the bondage that the Judaizers were attempting to impose.
- James uses eleutheria combined with nomos: "the perfect law of liberty" (Jas 1:25) and "the law of liberty" (Jas 2:12) -- suggesting that liberty and law are not opposed.

### Notes
- In Galatians 4:3 and 4:9, the "elements of the world" are described as "weak and beggarly" and associated with "bondage."
- Gal 4:10 immediately follows with "Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years" -- connecting stoicheion with calendrical observances.
- Col 2:8,20 uses the same phrase "rudiments of the world" in a context discussing "handwriting of ordinances" (Col 2:14), meat/drink, holydays, new moons, sabbath days (Col 2:16).

## exagorazo (G1805) -- "redeem"

**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** From ek (out of) and agorazo (to buy in the marketplace). To buy up, ransom; figuratively, to rescue from loss.
**BLB Count:** 4

### Translations in KJV (4 occurrences)
- "hath redeemed" -- 1x

### All Occurrences
- **Gal 3:13** -- "Christ hath redeemed [exagorazo] us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us"

- **Eph 5:16** -- "Redeeming [exagorazo] the time, because the days are evil"
- **Col 4:5** -- "Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming [exagorazo] the time"

### Notes
- In Galatians, exagorazo is used twice, both in the context of the law:
  - Gal 3:13: Redeemed from "the CURSE of the law" (not from the law itself)
  - Gal 4:5: Redeemed from being "under the law" (the legal system as a means of justification)
- The marketplace metaphor (ek + agorazo = "to buy out of") implies a purchase price was paid to free someone from a condition.
- Distinct from lutroo (G3084, "to ransom") and apolutrosis (G629, "redemption").

## peritome (G4061) -- "circumcision"
**Original:** peritome (Greek)
**Transliteration:** peritome
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** From peritemno (to cut around). Circumcision -- the rite, the condition, or the people.
**BLB Count:** 36

### Translations in KJV (32 occurrences)
- "circumcision" -- 17x (53.1%)
- "the circumcision" -- 7x (21.9%)
- "of circumcision" -- 4x (12.5%)
- Various other forms -- 4x

### Galatians Occurrences
- **Gal 2:7** -- "the gospel of the uncircumcision...the circumcision"
- **Gal 2:8** -- "apostleship of the circumcision"
- **Gal 2:9** -- "we unto the heathen, they unto the circumcision"
- **Gal 2:12** -- "fearing them which were of the circumcision"
- **Gal 5:6** -- "in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision"
- **Gal 5:11** -- "if I yet preach circumcision"
- **Gal 6:15** -- "neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision"

### Key Parallel
- **1 Cor 7:19** -- "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."

### Notes
- In Galatians, peritome is THE specific ceremonial practice at issue. The Judaizers were requiring circumcision for salvation (Acts 15:1).
- Paul uses peritome both for the rite itself and for the party/people ("them of the circumcision").
- The parallel in 1 Cor 7:19 explicitly distinguishes circumcision from "the commandments of God" -- circumcision is "nothing" while commandment-keeping is affirmed.
- Gal 5:6 and 6:15 both declare circumcision/uncircumcision to be irrelevant, replacing it with "faith which worketh by love" (5:6) and "a new creature" (6:15).
