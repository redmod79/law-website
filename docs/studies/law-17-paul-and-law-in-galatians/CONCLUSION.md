# What Is Paul Arguing in Galatians Regarding the Law?

## Question
What is Paul arguing in Galatians regarding the law? Investigate Gal 2:16, Gal 3:10-14, Gal 3:19, Gal 3:24-25, Gal 4:9-10, Gal 5:1-6, Gal 5:14, Gal 5:18. In each context, determine which "law" Paul is addressing -- the moral law, the ceremonial system, or the law as a means of justification.

## Summary Answer
Paul's argument in Galatians is directed against Judaizers who demanded that Gentile believers submit to circumcision and the ceremonial Jewish system as a requirement for salvation (2:3-4; 5:2-3; 6:12-13; Acts 15:1). Paul argues that no one is justified by "works of the law" (2:16), that Christ redeemed believers from the CURSE of the law (3:13 -- not from the law itself), and that the law's custodial function (paidagogos, 3:24-25) was preparatory for Christ. At the same time, Paul affirms the moral law's content: "all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (5:14), condemns "works of the flesh" that violate Decalogue commandments (5:19-21), and says faith works through love (5:6). Paul distinguishes between the law as a justification mechanism (rejected), the ceremonial system (superseded -- circumcision "is nothing," cf. 1 Cor 7:19), and the moral law's content (fulfilled through love by Spirit-led believers). This is the same three-way distinction found in Romans (law-16).

## Key Verses

**Galatians 2:16** -- "Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."

**Galatians 3:13** -- "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree."

**Galatians 5:6** -- "For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love."

**Galatians 5:14** -- "For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."

**Galatians 5:18-21** -- "But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."

**1 Corinthians 7:19** -- "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."

**New items from this study:**

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Position | Tree 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E409 | Paul states: "A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ...for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified." Threefold denial of law-justification. | Gal 2:16 | Neutral | V1: No -- states law's inability to justify, not continuation or cessation of moral law. V2: No. Both NO = Neutral. Both sides agree the law cannot justify. |
| E410 | Paul states: "If I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor." Paul "destroyed" his former reliance on law-justification; rebuilding it would make him a transgressor. | Gal 2:18 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Neutral. Paul's use of "transgressor" (parabatēs) implies a continuing moral standard against which transgression is measured. |
| E411 | Paul states: "If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain." Law-righteousness and Christ's death are mutually exclusive as justification methods. | Gal 2:21 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO = Neutral. Both sides agree that righteousness does not come through law-works. |
| E412 | Paul states: "As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them." Those relying on law-works are under a curse because perfect obedience is impossible. Quotes Deut 27:26. | Gal 3:10 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: Candidate -- "under the curse" is adjacent to cessation vocabulary. Gate 1: FAIL -- "the book of the law" encompasses the broad Mosaic code; the verse does not identify which law is cursing. The curse falls on imperfect obedience to ANY law used as a justification mechanism. RC1: Referent broad. RC3: Neither continuation nor cessation vocabulary applies to the diagnostic observation that imperfect obedience brings a curse. Neutral. |
| E413 | Paul states: "No man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith." Justification is by faith, not by law. Quotes Hab 2:4. | Gal 3:11 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO = Neutral. Both sides agree that justification is by faith. |
| E414 | Paul states: "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us." Christ redeemed believers from the CURSE (katara) of the law, not from the law itself. The preposition ek + genitive (kataras) specifies: redeemed OUT OF the curse. | Gal 3:13 | Neutral | V1: No -- does not use continuation vocabulary. V2: Candidate -- "redeemed from" is adjacent to cessation vocabulary. Gate 1: FAIL -- the object of redemption is "the curse of the law" (tes kataras tou nomou), not "the law" (tou nomou). The text distinguishes between the curse and the law. RC1: The grammatical object is the curse, not the law. RC2: Corrected: "Christ redeemed from the law's curse-penalty." RC3: Neither continuation nor cessation of the law itself. Neutral. NOTE: This verse was already registered as E252 in law-08. Add law-17 to Also In. |
| E415 | Paul states: "The law, which was four hundred and thirty years after [the promise to Abraham], cannot disannul [the promise], that it should make the promise of none effect." The law came 430 years after the promise and cannot override it. | Gal 3:17 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO = Neutral. Factual historical observation. |
| E416 | Paul states: "Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law." The law is NOT against God's promises (mē genoito). The law simply cannot give life/righteousness. | Gal 3:21 | Neutral | V1: "the law is not against the promises" could indicate law-continuation (law and promise are compatible, not opposed). Gate 1: FAIL -- "the law" referent is broad; which law is not against the promises? The statement is general. RC1: Referent broad. RC3: Neutral. Both sides accept law and promises are not contradictory. |
| E417 | Paul states: "But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years." Galatians turning to "weak and beggarly elements" identified as calendrical observances. | Gal 4:9-10 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: "weak and beggarly elements" is cessation-adjacent. Gate 1: The "elements" are identified by v.10 as "days, months, times, years" -- ceremonial calendar. Both sides agree the ceremonial calendar is no longer binding. IP0 applies: ceremonial cessation = common ground. Neutral. |
| E418 | Paul states: "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage." The "yoke of bondage" in context (v.2) is circumcision/ceremonial requirement. | Gal 5:1 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: "yoke of bondage" is cessation-adjacent. Gate 1: The "yoke" is identified by v.2 as circumcision. Both sides agree circumcision is not required. IP0 applies: ceremonial cessation = common ground. Neutral. |
| E419 | Paul states: "If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing." Submitting to circumcision as a salvation requirement nullifies Christ's benefit. | Gal 5:2 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO = Neutral. Both sides agree circumcision is not required for salvation. |
| E420 | Paul states: "I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law." Accepting circumcision for justification obligates one to the entire law-system as a justification mechanism. | Gal 5:3 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO = Neutral. Both sides agree you cannot selectively use the law-system for justification. |
| E421 | Paul states: "Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace." Law-justification and grace are mutually exclusive. | Gal 5:4 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO = Neutral. Both sides agree grace and law-justification are incompatible. |
| E422 | Paul states: "In Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love." Circumcision is irrelevant; faith working through love is what matters. | Gal 5:6 | Continues | V1: "faith which worketh by love" -- love is the fulfillment of the law (5:14; Rom 13:8-10). Faith is not antinomian; it produces love, and love fulfills the moral law. Gate 1: PASS -- "love" is identified by 5:14 as the principle that fulfills the law (quoting Lev 19:18). The Romans parallel (13:8-10) specifies love fulfills Decalogue commandments. Gate 2: PASS -- pistis di' agapēs energoumenē is grammatically clear. Gate 3: PASS -- didactic epistle. Gate 4: PASS -- consistent with E028, E143, E408. |
| E423 | Paul states: "For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." The ENTIRE law (ho pas nomos) is fulfilled (peplērotai, Perfect Passive) in the love command. Quotes Lev 19:18. | Gal 5:14 | Continues | V1: YES -- "all the law is fulfilled" is law-continuation vocabulary. Love fills/fulfills the law; the law remains as the container love fills. peplērotai (plēroō) = "has been and continues to be fulfilled," not kataluō (abolish). Gate 1: PASS -- "all the law" (ho pas nomos) is identified by the Romans parallel (same author, same Lev 19:18 quotation, same argument) as the moral law/Decalogue (Rom 13:8-10 quotes five Decalogue commands as what love fulfills). Gate 2: PASS -- Perfect Passive Indicative, unambiguous. Gate 3: PASS -- didactic epistle. Gate 4: PASS -- consistent with E028 (love fulfills Decalogue), E408 (pleroma of law). |
| E424 | Paul states: "If ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law." Spirit-led believers are not "under the law" (hypo nomon, anarthrous). | Gal 5:18 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: Candidate -- "not under the law" is cessation-adjacent. Gate 1: FAIL -- "under the law" (hypo nomon) has a semantic range: (a) under the law's condemning jurisdiction, (b) under the law's authority entirely. The anarthrous nomon suggests "law as a principle/system." Immediate context (vv.19-21) condemns Decalogue violations; v.14 affirms law through love. Rom 6:14-15 parallel: "not under law" does not permit sin. RC1: "Under the law" is ambiguous. RC2: Corrected: "Spirit-led believers are not under law's condemnation." RC3: Neither continuation nor cessation of moral law itself. Neutral. |
| E425 | Paul lists "works of the flesh": "Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings." Those who do such things "shall not inherit the kingdom of God." Multiple items are Decalogue violations (adultery = 7th, murder = 6th, idolatry = 1st/2nd). | Gal 5:19-21 | Continues | V1: YES -- Paul condemns Decalogue violations as excluding from God's kingdom. This presupposes the Decalogue remains the moral standard. Gate 1: PASS -- specific Decalogue content identified (adultery, murder, idolatry). Gate 2: PASS -- grammar clear (future indicative: "shall not inherit"). Gate 3: PASS -- didactic epistle. Gate 4: PASS -- consistent with E028 (Decalogue as operative standard), E029 (James cites Decalogue). |
| E426 | Paul states: "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law." The Spirit produces moral character that the law does not condemn. Spirit and moral law agree. | Gal 5:22-23 | Continues | V1: YES -- "against such there is no law" implies the law exists as a standard and that Spirit-produced character is consistent with it. The Spirit and the law are not opposed. Gate 1: PASS -- "no law" presupposes the law exists; the Spirit's fruit does not violate it. Gate 2: PASS -- grammar clear. Gate 3: PASS -- didactic. Gate 4: PASS -- consistent with E026 (law's dikaioma fulfilled by Spirit-walkers), N084 (purpose = law-fulfillment). |
| E427 | Paul states: "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ." The "law of Christ" (ton nomon tou Christou) involves moral obligation fulfilled through love. | Gal 6:2 | Continues | V1: YES -- "fulfil the law of Christ" is law-continuation vocabulary. The "law of Christ" is not lawlessness; it is a moral standard. Gate 1: PASS -- "the law of Christ" in context is the love-command application (burden-bearing). Gate 2: PASS -- grammar clear (anaplēroō = fulfill/fill up). Gate 3: PASS -- didactic. Gate 4: PASS -- consistent with E028, E423. |
| E428 | Paul states: "Neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh." The Judaizers who demand circumcision do not themselves keep the law. Paul distinguishes between circumcision (what they impose) and the law (what they fail to keep). | Gal 6:13 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Neutral. Factual observation about the Judaizers' inconsistency. Note: Paul's statement presupposes that "the law" is a meaningful standard the Judaizers should be keeping -- implying its ongoing validity. |
| E429 | Paul states: "In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature." Circumcision is irrelevant; new creation is what matters. | Gal 6:15 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Neutral. Both sides agree circumcision is irrelevant in Christ. |

### Necessary Implications (N-items)

*Tree 1 N-CHECK applied. Tree 4 Gate 0 applied. All three N-tier tests passed for each item.*

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Why unavoidable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N086 | The specific controversy in Galatians is circumcision and ceremonial requirements imposed by Judaizers, not the moral law/Decalogue. Paul names circumcision repeatedly (2:3-4; 5:2-3, 6, 11; 6:12-13) and never names a Decalogue commandment as what he opposes. | E419, E422, E428, E429 (circumcision named); E423 (law affirmed through love); E425 (Decalogue violations condemned) | Continues | Observable fact: Paul's every concrete example of what he opposes is circumcision/ceremonial. His every concrete moral example affirms Decalogue content. Both sides can verify this by reading the text. A scholar from the Abolished position cannot deny that circumcision is the named issue and that Paul condemns adultery, murder, idolatry. |
| N087 | Paul affirms the moral law's content in Galatians even while denying its justificatory power. He denies justification by law (2:16; 3:11; 5:4) AND affirms the law is fulfilled in love (5:14), condemns Decalogue violations (5:19-21), and says the Spirit's fruit does not violate the law (5:23). | E409 (not justified by law), E413 (not justified by law), E421 (fallen from grace), E423 (law fulfilled in love), E425 (flesh-works condemned), E426 (Spirit's fruit consistent with law) | Continues | Observable: Paul says both (1) law cannot justify and (2) law is fulfilled in love / its violations are condemned. Both propositions are in the same epistle. A scholar from either position must acknowledge both sets of statements. The combination -- law cannot justify but continues as moral standard -- is what the text states. |
| N088 | Paul distinguishes between circumcision (ceremonial, dismissed) and "the commandments of God" (moral, affirmed) in 1 Cor 7:19, written by the same author during the same period. This demonstrates Paul does not treat all law as a single undifferentiated unit. | E143 (1 Cor 7:19), E422 (Gal 5:6), E419 (Gal 5:2) | Continues | Observable: the same author, in a single verse (1 Cor 7:19), calls circumcision "nothing" and calls the commandments of God something worth keeping. Both sides can verify the words of the verse. The factual observation is that Paul distinguishes. |
| N089 | In Galatians 3:13, the grammatical object of exagorazo (redeemed) is "the curse of the law" (ek tes kataras tou nomou), not "the law" (ek tou nomou). The text distinguishes between the law and the law's curse. | E414/E252 (Gal 3:13 text), Greek parsing (ek + genitive kataras) | Neutral | Observable grammatical fact: the preposition ek governs kataras (curse), not nomou (law) directly. Both sides can verify this from the Greek text. A scholar from either position must acknowledge the grammatical structure. |
| N090 | Paul's "works of the flesh" list (Gal 5:19-21) includes violations of specific Decalogue commandments (adultery = 7th, murder = 6th, idolatry = 1st/2nd), and Paul says those who do such things "shall not inherit the kingdom of God." This is stated AFTER "ye are not under the law" (5:18), demonstrating that "not under the law" does not mean Decalogue violations are now permitted. | E424 (not under law), E425 (works of flesh condemned) | Continues | Observable sequence: v.18 says "not under the law"; vv.19-21 condemn Decalogue violations. Both sides can verify the sequence. A scholar from the opposite position cannot deny that Paul condemns these acts in context after saying "not under the law." The combination requires that "not under the law" does not mean "free from moral standards." |

### Inferences (I-items)

*Tree 2 applied for type classification. Tree 5 applied for positional classification.*

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I108 | Paul's argument in Galatians demonstrates that the moral law (Decalogue) continues as the standard of conduct fulfilled by love through the Spirit, while the ceremonial system (circumcision, calendar) and the law as a justification mechanism are set aside. The law is fulfilled (5:14), not abolished; its violations are condemned (5:19-21); the Spirit produces its requirements (5:22-23); and the specific things dismissed are ceremonial (circumcision, days/months/times/years). | I-A | E409 (not justified by law), E417 (weak elements = calendar), E419 (circumcision profits nothing), E422 (faith working by love), E423 (all law fulfilled in love), E424 (not under law), E425 (works of flesh condemned), E426 (fruit of Spirit = no law against), E427 (fulfil law of Christ), N086 (circumcision is the named issue), N087 (Paul affirms moral law while denying justificatory power), N088 (Paul distinguishes circumcision from commandments of God) | Continues | Systematizes multiple E/N items into a comprehensive claim. All components are found in E/N tables. It requires only criterion #5 (systematizing). Direction: aligns with E/N -- no E/N statement is required to mean something other than its lexical value. Source: all text-derived. I-A confirmed. |
| I109 | Paul's phrase "not under the law" (Gal 5:18) refers to freedom from the law's condemning jurisdiction, not freedom from its moral authority -- the same meaning established in Rom 6:14-15 (law-16, I103). This is supported by the immediate context: v.14 affirms law through love, vv.19-21 condemn Decalogue violations, vv.22-23 say Spirit-fruit is consistent with the law. | I-A | E423 (law fulfilled in love), E424 (not under law), E425 (works of flesh condemned), E426 (fruit of Spirit), N090 (not-under-law followed by Decalogue condemnation). SIS verified: same author, same phrase (hypo nomon), same contextual pattern (denial of sin follows both occurrences -- Rom 6:15; Gal 5:19-21). | Continues | Systematizes E/N items. Same-author SIS connection verified (#4a). All components text-derived. No E/N required to mean other than lexical value. I-A. |
| I110 | Paul's teaching in Galatians abolishes the moral law (Decalogue) because "not under the law" (5:18) means the entire law is set aside, the law was a temporary schoolmaster "till the seed should come" (3:19, 24-25), and the "yoke of bondage" (5:1) includes the Decalogue. The moral law ended when Christ came. | I-B | FOR: E058 (law added till seed come, Ambiguous), E059 (no longer under schoolmaster, Ambiguous), E424 (not under law, Ambiguous after reclassification). AGAINST: E423 (all law fulfilled in love, Continues), E425 (Decalogue violations condemned, Continues), E426 (Spirit-fruit consistent with law, Continues), E422 (faith working by love, Continues), E427 (fulfil law of Christ, Continues), E143 (circumcision nothing, commandments of God, Continues), N086 (circumcision is the named issue), N087 (Paul affirms moral law while denying justificatory power), N088 (Paul distinguishes ceremonial from moral), N090 (not-under-law followed by Decalogue condemnation). | Abolished | Text-derived (all from E/N tables) but conflicts with multiple E/N statements. "Not under the law" is required to mean complete abolition -- but E425 condemns Decalogue violations in the same context, and N090 shows the sequence prohibits that reading. "Schoolmaster till the seed" must mean the Decalogue ended -- but E423 affirms the law through love and E422 says faith works by love. Criteria: #2 (choosing between readings of "under the law," "till the seed," "schoolmaster"), #5 (systematizing). I-B: E/N items on both sides. |
| I111 | Paul treats all law in Galatians as a single undifferentiated unit. "The law" always means the entire Mosaic system without distinction, and "not under the law" means all of it -- moral, ceremonial, and civil -- is set aside. | I-D | FOR: Paul uses "the law" (ho nomos) without always specifying which law. AGAINST: N086 (Paul's every concrete example of opposition = circumcision/ceremonial; every concrete moral example = Decalogue content); N088 (same author distinguishes circumcision from commandments of God in 1 Cor 7:19); E423 (the law affirmed through love); E417 (ceremonial calendar specifically identified as "weak and beggarly elements"); E425 (Decalogue violations specifically condemned). | Abolished | Requires OVERRIDING E/N statements: N086 (Paul names circumcision as the issue, not the Decalogue), N088 (Paul distinguishes in 1 Cor 7:19), E417 (specifically identifies ceremonial calendar). The claim that all law is one unit requires adding a concept the text does not state. Paul DOES distinguish by content: circumcision dismissed (5:6), Decalogue violations condemned (5:19-21), law fulfilled in love (5:14). Requires #1 (adding "all law is one" concept), #3 (external framework). I-D: external origin, overrides E/N. |

### I-B Resolution: I110 -- Paul's teaching in Galatians abolishes the moral law

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR abolition: E058 (law added till seed come), E059 (no longer under schoolmaster), E424 (not under the law)
- AGAINST abolition: E423 (all law fulfilled in love), E425 (Decalogue violations condemned as excluding from kingdom), E426 (Spirit-fruit consistent with law), E422 (faith working by love), E427 (fulfil law of Christ), E143 (circumcision nothing, commandments of God everything), N086 (circumcision is the named issue), N087 (Paul affirms moral law while denying justificatory power), N088 (Paul distinguishes ceremonial from moral), N090 (not-under-law followed by Decalogue condemnation)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E423 (law fulfilled in love) | Plain | Direct statement with identified content (Lev 19:18 quotation); peplērotai = "has been fulfilled" is unambiguous |
| E425 (Decalogue violations condemned) | Plain | Direct list naming adultery, murder, idolatry with "shall not inherit the kingdom" |
| E426 (Spirit-fruit vs. law) | Plain | Direct statement: "against such there is no law" presupposes the law exists |
| E422 (faith by love) | Plain | Direct statement; love is identified by 5:14 as law-fulfillment |
| E427 (law of Christ) | Plain | Direct command to fulfill a law; moral obligation affirmed |
| E143 (circumcision nothing, commandments) | Plain | Direct statement distinguishing circumcision from commandments of God |
| N086 (circumcision is the issue) | Plain | Observable fact: inventory of Paul's named targets |
| N087 (affirms moral law) | Plain | Observable pattern: two sets of statements in same epistle |
| N088 (Paul distinguishes) | Plain | Observable: 1 Cor 7:19 explicitly distinguishes |
| N090 (sequence: not-under-law then condemns) | Contextually Clear | Requires noting the sequence across vv.18-21 |
| E058 (added till seed come) | Ambiguous | "The law" referent is ambiguous; "till the seed" could apply to custodial function or to the law's entire existence |
| E059 (no longer under schoolmaster) | Ambiguous | Paidagogos metaphor could mean law abolished or custodial function ended |
| E424 (not under the law) | Ambiguous | "Under the law" has semantic range; context (vv.14, 19-21) pushes toward condemnation reading |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
- FOR abolition: 3 items, ALL at the Ambiguous level (E058, E059, E424)
- AGAINST abolition: 10 items; 9 at the Plain level, 1 at Contextually Clear level

The weight is decisively against the abolition reading. The FOR side relies entirely on ambiguous phrases that admit alternative readings. The AGAINST side has 9 Plain statements and 1 Contextually Clear statement, including concrete content (specific Decalogue commands condemned, law fulfilled in love, circumcision distinguished from commandments of God).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements determine the reading of the Ambiguous ones:
- E058 ("till the seed should come"): Plain E423 (law fulfilled in love) and E425 (Decalogue violations condemned after Christ's coming) determine that the temporal limit applies to the law's custodial/condemning function, not to its moral content. Paul himself, writing after Christ's coming, affirms the law through love and condemns its violations.
- E059 ("no longer under a schoolmaster"): Plain E423 and N090 determine that "no longer under a schoolmaster" means the custodial arrangement ended, not that the moral content was abolished. The adult no longer has a guardian but still follows moral principles.
- E424 ("not under the law"): Plain E425 (Decalogue violations condemned in vv.19-21, immediately following v.18) and N090 (sequence shows "not under law" does not permit Decalogue violations) determine that "not under the law" means not under law's condemnation, not freedom from moral obligation. Same reading established for Rom 6:14-15 (I103).

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
Plain statements are exclusively on the AGAINST-abolition side (9 Plain + 1 Contextually Clear). The FOR-abolition side has only Ambiguous statements (3 items), all of which admit non-abolition readings that are determined by the Plain statements via SIS. The Abolished reading of Galatians requires ALL three ambiguous items to be read in their abolition sense while ignoring or reinterpreting 9 Plain statements in the same epistle. Resolution: Strong against the Abolished reading.

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases actual verse text. Checked.
- Each is the plain meaning of the words in the verse. Checked.
- No E-item is a positional inference.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- E409-E413, E415-E416 (Neutral) -- no continuation or cessation vocabulary. Classification stands.
- E414 (Neutral after reclassification) -- "redeemed from the curse" not "from the law." Classification stands.
- E417 (Neutral) -- ceremonial calendar = common ground. Classification stands.
- E418 (Neutral) -- yoke = circumcision = common ground. Classification stands.
- E419-E421 (Neutral) -- circumcision/justification = common ground. Classification stands.
- E422 (Continues) -- faith working by love. All four gates passed. Classification stands.
- E423 (Continues) -- law fulfilled in love. All four gates passed. Classification stands.
- E424 (Neutral after reclassification) -- "under the law" ambiguous. Classification stands.
- E425 (Continues) -- Decalogue violations condemned. All four gates passed. Classification stands.
- E426 (Continues) -- Spirit-fruit consistent with law. All four gates passed. Classification stands.
- E427 (Continues) -- fulfil law of Christ. All four gates passed. Classification stands.
- E428-E429 (Neutral) -- factual observations. Classification stands.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- N086 (circumcision is the issue): Observable fact. Both sides can verify. Continues. Confirmed.
- N087 (affirms moral law while denying justificatory power): Observable pattern. Both sides can verify both sets of statements. Continues. Confirmed.
- N088 (Paul distinguishes): Observable from 1 Cor 7:19. Both sides can verify. Continues. Confirmed.
- N089 (redeemed from curse, not law): Greek grammar fact. Both sides can verify. Neutral. Confirmed.
- N090 (not-under-law then condemns violations): Observable sequence. Both sides can verify. Continues. Confirmed.

**Steps C-E: Verify inference classifications.**
- I108 (I-A Continues): Source test -- all components in E/N tables. Direction test -- no E/N required to mean other than lexical value. Consistency -- only criterion #5. Confirmed I-A.
- I109 (I-A Continues): Source test -- all text-derived. Direction -- aligns. Consistency -- #5 + #4a (verified SIS: same author, same phrase). Confirmed I-A.
- I110 (I-B Abolished): Source test -- text-derived. Direction -- conflicts with E/N (requires ambiguous items to override plain items). E/N items on BOTH sides -- confirmed I-B. Full resolution section provided. Resolved Strong against Abolished.
- I111 (I-D Abolished): Source test -- requires adding "all law is one unit" concept not found in E/N. Direction -- overrides N086, N088, E417, E425. Confirmed I-D.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- I109: SIS connection between Gal 5:18 (ambiguous) and Gal 5:14, 19-21 (plain). Connection: same author, same chapter, immediate context. Also: same phrase as Rom 6:14 (same author). Verified.
- I110 resolution: SIS connections verified (same epistle, same chapter, same author throughout).

## What CAN Be Said

Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies:

- Paul's specific controversy in Galatians is circumcision and the ceremonial system imposed by Judaizers, not the moral law/Decalogue (2:3-4; 5:2-3, 6, 11; 6:12-13)
- No one is justified by works of the law -- no flesh (2:16; 3:11; 5:4)
- Christ redeemed believers from THE CURSE of the law, not from the law itself (3:13 -- grammatically, ek tes kataras tou nomou)
- The law was added because of transgressions and had a custodial function until Christ (3:19, 24-25) -- the referent of "the law" in these verses is ambiguous
- The "weak and beggarly elements" are identified by the text as calendrical observances: "days, months, times, years" (4:9-10) -- ceremonial, not moral
- The "yoke of bondage" is identified by context as circumcision (5:1-2)
- Circumcision is irrelevant; what matters is faith working by love (5:6) and new creation (6:15)
- "ALL the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (5:14) -- the law is fulfilled (plēroō), not abolished (kataluō)
- "Not under the law" (5:18) is immediately followed by condemnation of Decalogue violations (5:19-21: adultery, murder, idolatry) -- demonstrating that "not under the law" does not mean the moral law is abolished
- The Spirit's fruit is consistent with the law: "against such there is no law" (5:22-23)
- Paul distinguishes circumcision (ceremonial, "nothing") from "the commandments of God" (moral, affirmed) in the same verse (1 Cor 7:19)

## What CANNOT Be Said

Neither side can claim the text of Galatians directly says or necessarily implies:

- That Paul names any Decalogue commandment as abolished -- no verse in Galatians says this
- That "not under the law" means "free from all moral obligation" -- Paul immediately condemns moral violations (5:19-21)
- That the "schoolmaster" metaphor means the law was destroyed -- the paidagogos role ends, but the moral principles remain (5:14)
- That "till the seed should come" definitively means the Decalogue ended at Christ -- Paul himself, writing after Christ's coming, affirms the law through love (5:14) and condemns its violations (5:19-21)
- That the "weak and beggarly elements" include the moral law -- the text identifies them as calendrical observances (4:10)
- That the "yoke of bondage" is the Decalogue -- the text identifies it as circumcision (5:2)
- That the law is abolished and replaced by a "law of love" -- Paul says the law IS fulfilled in love (5:14), meaning love fills the law; the law remains as the standard love fills
- That Paul treats all law as one undifferentiated unit -- the same author distinguishes circumcision from commandments of God (1 Cor 7:19)
- That the moral law can justify -- Paul is clear on this across both Galatians and Romans

## How This Study Builds on Prior Findings

### Relation to Law-16 (Paul and Law in Romans) -- Companion Study
Galatians and Romans present the same theology of the law from different angles:

| Topic | Romans | Galatians |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Law cannot justify | 3:20 (E391) | 2:16 (E409), 3:11 (E413) |
| Faith does not void the law | 3:31 (E025) | 5:14 (E423, implied) |
| Not under the law | 6:14 (E394) | 5:18 (E424) |
| Sin still condemned | 6:15 (E395: "shall we sin? God forbid") | 5:19-21 (E425: works of flesh condemned) |
| Love fulfills the law | 13:8-10 (E028, E408) | 5:14 (E423) |
| Decalogue = operative standard | 13:9 (quotes 5 commands, E028) | 5:19-21 (condemns violations) |
| Spirit enables law-fulfillment | 8:4 (E026) | 5:16-23 (E426) |
| Redeemed from condemnation | 8:1 (no condemnation) | 3:13 (redeemed from curse, E414) |

The two studies together establish that Paul consistently distinguishes between the law as a justification mechanism (rejected), the ceremonial system (superseded), and the moral law's content (fulfilled through love by Spirit-led believers).

### Relation to Law-08 (Abolished at Cross)
Law-08 found that Gal 3:13 removes "the CURSE of the law," not the law itself (E252). This study confirms and expands that finding with Greek grammatical analysis. Law-08 classified Gal 3:19 and 3:24-25 as Neutral (ambiguous referent) -- this study maintains those classifications.

### Relation to Law-04 (Ceremonial Laws)
Law-04 identified circumcision as a ceremonial law. This study confirms that the Galatian controversy is specifically about circumcision -- the ceremonial requirement the Judaizers imposed. The "days, months, times, years" of 4:10 match the ceremonial calendar identified in law-04.

### Relation to Law-09 (Old Covenant/New Covenant)
Law-09 established that the new covenant writes the SAME law on hearts (Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10). Galatians 5:14 confirms this: the law's moral content (love thy neighbour) continues as the standard fulfilled by Spirit-led believers.

### Relation to Law-01 (God's Moral Law)
Law-01 established the Decalogue's unique attributes: holy, just, good, spiritual, eternal. Galatians 5:14 treats the moral law as a continuing standard fulfilled by love. Galatians 5:19-21 condemns violations of specific Decalogue commandments. Paul's treatment of the moral law in Galatians is consistent with the attributes established in law-01.

## Conclusion

Paul's argument in Galatians is a sustained polemic against the Judaizers' demand for circumcision and ceremonial law-keeping as prerequisites for salvation. Across approximately 32 uses of nomos in the epistle, Paul consistently argues that the law cannot justify (2:16; 3:11; 5:4), that Christ redeemed believers from the law's curse (3:13, not from the law itself), that the law had a custodial function leading to Christ (3:24-25), and that the ceremonial system (circumcision, calendrical observances) is superseded (5:2-6; 4:9-10; 6:15).

At the same time, Paul affirms the moral law's content: "all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (5:14), condemns "works of the flesh" that violate Decalogue commandments (5:19-21), describes the Spirit's fruit as consistent with the law (5:22-23), and calls believers to "fulfil the law of Christ" (6:2). The same author who wrote Galatians also wrote: "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God" (1 Cor 7:19).

The three ambiguous passages (3:19, 3:24-25, 5:18) have been interpreted by some as abolishing the moral law. However, the I-B resolution demonstrates that all three are Ambiguous in their referent, while the AGAINST-abolition side has 9 Plain and 1 Contextually Clear statements in the same epistle. The SIS principle determines that the plain statements govern the ambiguous ones. Paul's own immediate context (5:14 affirms law through love; 5:19-21 condemns Decalogue violations) makes the abolition reading of 5:18 untenable within the same chapter. The resolution is Strong against the Abolished reading.

All explicit statements and necessary implications from Galatians that bear positionally on the moral law point toward the Continues classification. The Abolished reading of Galatians is classified as I-B, resolved Strong against abolition, with the same result as the companion study on Romans (law-16). The two epistles together constitute Paul's most extensive law-theology and present a unified picture: the law cannot justify, but faith establishes the law (Rom 3:31), the Spirit fulfills the law's righteous requirement (Rom 8:4; Gal 5:14, 22-23), and the specific things set aside are the ceremonial system and the law's condemning function -- not the moral law's ongoing authority.
