## [H7676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7676/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- shabbath (Sabbath)
**Original:** שַׁבָּת
**Transliteration:** shabbath
**Pronunciation:** shab-bawth
**Part of Speech:** masculine/feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 108 (BLB count) / 109 total translation occurrences

### Definition
Intensive from [H7673](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7673/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (shabath, "to cease"); intermission, i.e., specifically the Sabbath.

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| the sabbath | 42 | 38.5% |
| my sabbaths | 14 | 12.8% |
| on the sabbath | 11 | 10.1% |
| a sabbath | 7 | 6.4% |
| sabbath | 6 | 5.5% |
| her sabbaths | 4 | 3.7% |
| sabbaths | 3 | 2.8% |
| (other forms) | 22 | 20.2% |

### Key Observations
- **Never carries a lunar meaning** -- in all 108 uses, shabbath refers to a fixed weekly rest day
- **Never connected to the moon** -- no verse ties shabbath to any celestial body
- Used throughout OT from Exodus 16 to post-exile Nehemiah, showing continuous usage across the entire biblical timeline
- Post-exile usage in Nehemiah 13:15-22 shows the Sabbath was identifiable after the Babylonian captivity

### Key Verse Occurrences
- Exo 16:23-30 (manna narrative -- 7 occurrences)
- Exo 20:8-11 (Fourth Commandment -- 4 occurrences)
- Lev 23:3, 32, 38 (Sabbath in feast calendar)
- Neh 9:14; 13:15-22 (post-exile identification)
- Isa 58:13; 66:23 (prophetic continuation)
- Eze 20:12-24 (Sabbath as sign)

## [G4521](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4521/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- sabbaton (Sabbath / week)
**Original:** σάββατον
**Transliteration:** sabbaton
**Pronunciation:** sab-bat-on
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun
**Occurrences:** 68 (BLB count) / 55 translation occurrences

### Definition
Of Hebrew origin (H7676); the Sabbath (i.e., Shabbath), or day of weekly rest.

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| sabbath | 19 | 34.5% |
| sabbath day | 13 | 23.6% |
| sabbath days | 7 | 12.7% |
| of the week | 4 | 7.3% |
| the sabbath day | 3 | 5.5% |
| week | 3 | 5.5% |
| of the sabbath | 2 | 3.6% |
| (other) | 4 | 7.3% |

### Key Observations
- **Dual usage:** "the Sabbath day" AND "of the week" (as in "mia ton sabbaton" = "first [day] of the week")
- Used in the crucifixion-resurrection narratives in all four Gospels
- The double use confirms the Sabbath anchored the weekly cycle: the week was counted FROM the Sabbath
- Appears in all NT Sabbath controversies (Mat 12, Mrk 2-3, Luk 6, 13-14, Jhn 5, 7, 9)
- Used in Paul's Sabbath-keeping passages (Acts 13:14,27,42,44; 15:21; 16:13; 17:2; 18:4)

### Critical "First Day of the Week" Occurrences
- Mat 28:1 -- "mian sabbaton" = "first [day] of the week" (resurrection morning)
- Mrk 16:2, 9 -- "mia ton sabbaton" = "first [day] of the week"
- Luk 24:1 -- "mia ton sabbaton" = "first [day] of the week"
- Jhn 20:1, 19 -- "mia ton sabbaton" = "first [day] of the week"
- Acts 20:7 -- "mia ton sabbaton" = "first [day] of the week"
- 1 Cor 16:2 -- "mian sabbaton" (implied "first day of the week")

## [G3904](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3904/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- paraskeue (Preparation / Friday)
**Original:** παρασκευή
**Transliteration:** paraskeue
**Pronunciation:** par-ask-yoo-ay
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 6 (BLB count)

### Definition
From paraskeuazo ("to prepare"); readiness, preparation. Technical name for the day before the Sabbath -- Friday.

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| the preparation | 2 | 66.7% |
| day of the preparation | 1 | 33.3% |

### All 6 NT Occurrences (ALL in crucifixion narrative)
1. **Mat 27:62** -- "the next day, that followed the day of the preparation"
2. **Mrk 15:42** -- "it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath"
3. **Luk 23:54** -- "that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on"
4. **Jhn 19:14** -- "it was the preparation of the passover"
5. **Jhn 19:31** -- "because it was the preparation"
6. **Jhn 19:42** -- "because of the Jews' preparation day"

### Critical Observations
- **ALL 6 occurrences are in the crucifixion week narratives** -- the event that anchors the weekly cycle
- Mark 15:42 DEFINES paraskeue as prosabbaton ("day before the sabbath")
- **Modern Greek still calls Friday "Paraskeue"** -- a living linguistic fossil from the first century
- This is a FIXED weekly day-name: it proves the Sabbath fell on a fixed, predictable day
- A floating or uncertain sabbath could not produce a standardized name for the day before it

## [G4315](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4315/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- prosabbaton (day before the Sabbath)
**Original:** προσάββατον
**Transliteration:** prosabbaton
**Pronunciation:** pros-ab-bat-on
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun
**Occurrences:** 1 (hapax legomenon)

### Definition
From pro ("before") + sabbaton ("Sabbath"); a fore-sabbath, i.e., the Sabbath-eve.

### The Single Occurrence
- **Mrk 15:42** -- "it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath [prosabbaton]"

### Critical Observations
- **Hapax legomenon** -- appears only once in the NT
- Mark coins this compound word to DEFINE paraskeue: the Preparation IS the day-before-the-Sabbath
- The very existence of this word proves the Sabbath was on a fixed, known day
- You do not create a compound word for "the day before X" unless X falls on a predictable, known day
- This is among the strongest linguistic evidence for calendar continuity

## [G4520](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4520/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- sabbatismos (Sabbath-keeping)
**Original:** σαββατισμός
**Transliteration:** sabbatismos
**Pronunciation:** sab-bat-is-mos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 1 (hapax legomenon)

### Definition
From sabbatizo ("to keep sabbath"); a "sabbatism," i.e., the practice of Sabbath-keeping.

### The Single Occurrence
- **Heb 4:9** -- "There remaineth therefore a rest [sabbatismos] to the people of God."

### Critical Observations
- The -ismos suffix in Greek denotes PRACTICE or OBSERVANCE (cf. baptismos = practice of baptizing)
- Distinguished from katapausis (G2663, "rest"), which appears 8 times in Hebrews 3-4
- The author switches from katapausis to sabbatismos ONLY in v.9 -- a deliberate word choice
- apoleipetai ("remaineth") is Present Passive = "is presently remaining"
- This word affirms that Sabbath-KEEPING (not generic rest) remains for God's people

## [H7677](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7677/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- shabbathon (sabbatism / special rest)
**Original:** שַׁבָּתוֹן
**Transliteration:** shabbathon
**Pronunciation:** shab-baw-thone
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 11

### Definition
From [H7676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7676/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; a sabbatism or special holiday -- rest, sabbath.

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| of rest | 7 | 63.6% |
| a sabbath | 3 | 27.3% |
| the rest | 1 | 9.1% |

### Key Occurrences
- Exo 16:23 (manna: "rest of the holy sabbath" = shabbath shabbathon)
- Exo 31:15; 35:2 (weekly sabbath: shabbath shabbathon)
- Lev 16:31; 23:3, 32 (weekly sabbath and Day of Atonement)
- Lev 23:24, 39 (Feast of Trumpets, Tabernacles: shabbathon alone)
- Lev 25:4-5 (sabbatical year)

### Critical Observations
- The phrase "shabbath shabbathon" (sabbath of complete rest) is used for the weekly Sabbath in Exo 16:23 -- the very first identification of the Sabbath in the manna narrative
- This appears BEFORE Sinai, establishing the Sabbath as pre-Sinaitic

## [H7637](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7637/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- shevi'i (seventh)
**Original:** שְׁבִיעִי
**Transliteration:** shevi'i
**Pronunciation:** sheb-ee-ee
**Part of Speech:** adjective (ordinal)
**Occurrences:** 98

### Definition
Ordinal from [H7651](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7651/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (sheba, "seven"); seventh.

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| the seventh | 48 | 49.0% |
| seventh | 40 | 40.8% |
| (other forms) | 10 | 10.2% |

### Key Occurrences
- **Gen 2:2-3** -- "on THE SEVENTH day [yom hashevi'i] God ended his work... God blessed THE SEVENTH day"
- Exo 12:15; 21:2; 23:11 (other seventh-references)
- Lev 23:16 (counting to Pentecost)
- Joshua 6:16 (seventh day around Jericho)

### Critical Observations
- The definite article + ordinal in Gen 2:2-3 ("THE seventh day") specifies a PARTICULAR day, not "a seventh day" or "one day in seven"
- The commandment (Exo 20:10) uses the same construction: "THE seventh day IS the sabbath of the LORD thy God"
- This grammatical specificity matters for the identification question: God blessed and sanctified a SPECIFIC day

## [H7620](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7620/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- shabuah (week)
**Original:** שָׁבוּעַ
**Transliteration:** shabuah
**Pronunciation:** shaw-boo-ah
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 20

### Definition
Passive participle of [H7650](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7650/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} as denominative of [H7651](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7651/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; literally "sevened," i.e., a week (specifically, of years): seven, week.

### Key Observations
- Derives from the same root as shabbath (seven/rest)
- The Hebrew concept of "week" is inseparable from the concept of "seven" and "Sabbath"
- Used in Dan 9:24-27 for prophetic "weeks" (sevens of years)
- Used for the Feast of Weeks (Shavuot/Pentecost) in Exo 34:22; Deu 16:9-10

---

## [G1520](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1520/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- heis (one / first)
**Original:** εἷς
**Transliteration:** heis
**Pronunciation:** hice
**Part of Speech:** numeral
**Occurrences:** 272

### Key Usage in Calendar Context
- Used in "mia ton sabbaton" = "first [day] of the week" in all four resurrection accounts
- Mat 28:1; Mrk 16:2, 9; Luk 24:1; Jhn 20:1, 19; Acts 20:7; 1 Cor 16:2
- The cardinal numeral "one" used as an ordinal "first" -- Semitic idiom
- The fact that the first day was counted from the Sabbath shows the Sabbath anchored the weekly count

---

## [G2663](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2663/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- katapausis (rest)
**Original:** κατάπαυσις
**Transliteration:** katapausis
**Pronunciation:** kat-ap-ow-sis
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 9

### Definition
From katapauo ("to repose down"); reposing, abode -- rest.

### All Occurrences
- Acts 7:49 (1x)
- Heb 3:11, 18 (2x)
- Heb 4:1, 3 (twice in 4:3), 5, 10 (5x)

### Critical Observations
- Used 8 times in Hebrews 3-4 for "rest" (generic/Canaan-rest/God's-rest)
- Distinguished from sabbatismos (G4520) which appears ONLY in Heb 4:9
- The switch from katapausis (8x) to sabbatismos (1x) in 4:9 is a deliberate vocabulary change
- katapausis = general concept of rest/ceasing; sabbatismos = specifically Sabbath-keeping practice

## [H4478](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4478/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- man (manna)
**Original:** מָן
**Transliteration:** man
**Pronunciation:** mawn
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 14 (BLB) / 15 translation occurrences

### Definition
From [H4100](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4100/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; literally "a whatness" (so to speak), i.e., manna (so called from the question about it).

### Key Observations
- All OT occurrences are in Exo 16, Num 11, Deu 8, Jos 5:12, Neh 9:20, Psa 78:24
- The manna narrative (Exo 16) is the foundational text for God's 40-year identification of the seventh day
- "Forty years" (Exo 16:35) = approximately 2,080 consecutive weeks of divinely marked 6+1 cycles
- The manna cycle proves God KNEW which day was the seventh and ENFORCED it miraculously
