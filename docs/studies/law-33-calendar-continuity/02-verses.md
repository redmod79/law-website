## Prior Study Key Conclusions (Summary)

**law-13:** Every Sabbath controversy was about HOW, not WHICH day. 12 instances using exesti ("is it lawful?") framework. Zero disputes about which day is the Sabbath.

**law-24:** Leviticus 23:37-38 explicitly separates weekly sabbaths from annual feasts using millibad. The weekly Sabbath has no calendar date; it is "the seventh day" in a continuous cycle.

**law-27:** No NT verse explicitly abolishes the weekly Sabbath. Grounded in creation (Gen 2:2-3), confirmed by Jesus (Mrk 2:28), operative after crucifixion (Luk 23:56), anticipated post-cross (Mat 24:20), remains (Heb 4:9), continues to new earth (Isa 66:23).

**law-32:** The weekly Sabbath follows a continuous 7-day cycle independent of the moon. 33 E-items + 6 N-items support continuous cycle; 0 support lunar sabbaths. Fixed weekly day-names (paraskeue, prosabbaton) prove predictable weekly cycle.

**seventh-day-identity:** Five independent lines of evidence identify Saturday as the seventh day: Jewish tradition (3,000+ years), Christian tradition, Islamic tradition, astronomical records, linguistic evidence (108+ languages name Saturday "Sabbath"). The Gregorian reform changed dates, not days.
