## EXO 16:23

```
======================================================================
  CONCEPT CONTEXT: Exodus 16:23
======================================================================

  "And he said unto them, This [is that] which the LORD hath said, To morrow [is] the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake [that] which ye will bake [to day], and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning."

  Book: Exodus | Chapter: 16 | Author: Moses

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  CONCEPTS IN THIS VERSE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    TEMPLE: Heykal/naos - temple, sanctuary
      Strong's: H6944 (of the holy)
    HOLY: Qadosh/hagios - set apart, sacred
      Strong's: H6944 (of the holy)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  SAME BOOK (Exodus) (74 verses)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Exodus 12:16 [HOLY]
     "And in the first day [there shall be] an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save [that] which every man must eat, that only may be done of you."

  2. Exodus 13:2 [HOLY]
     "Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, [both] of man and of beast: it [is] mine."

  3. Exodus 15:11 [HOLY]
     "Who [is] like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who [is] like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful [in] praises, doing wonders?"

  4. Exodus 15:13 [HOLY]
     "Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people [which] thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided [them] in thy strength unto thy holy habitation."

  5. Exodus 19:10 [HOLY]
     "And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,"

  6. Exodus 19:14 [HOLY]
     "And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes."

**Observation:** The concept tool identified HOLY (qadosh/H6944) as the key concept in the manna-Sabbath verse. The Sabbath is explicitly called "the holy sabbath" in Exo 16:23, linking it to the qadosh concept -- the same word used in Gen 2:3 where God "sanctified" (qadash) the seventh day.

## LUK 23:56

```
======================================================================
  CONCEPT CONTEXT: Luke 23:56
======================================================================

  "And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment."

  Book: Luke | Chapter: 23 | Author: Luke

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  CONCEPTS IN THIS VERSE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    LAW: Torah, commandments, statutes, ordinances
      Strong's: G1785 (commandment)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  SAME BOOK (Luke) (13 verses)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Luke 1:6 [LAW]
     "And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless."

  2. Luke 10:26 [LAW]
     "He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?"

  3. Luke 15:29 [LAW]
     "And he answering said to [his] father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment..."

  4. Luke 16:17 [LAW]
     "And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."

  5. Luke 18:20 [LAW]
     "Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  SAME AUTHOR (Luke) (22 verses)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Acts 13:15 [LAW]
     "And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them..."

  2. Acts 13:39 [LAW]
     "And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses."

  3. Acts 15:24 [LAW]
     "...saying, [Ye must] be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no [such] commandment:"

  4. Acts 15:5 [LAW]
     "...saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command [them] to keep the law of Moses."

  5. Acts 16:4 [LAW]
     "And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep..."

  [Additional verses returned from same author and other books]
```

**Observation:** The concept tool identified LAW (entole/G1785) as the key concept. Luke says the women rested "according to the commandment" (kata ten entolen) -- linking their Sabbath rest to the Fourth Commandment (Exo 20:8-11). This proves: (1) the women knew which day was the Sabbath, (2) they considered the commandment operative, and (3) Luke affirms their Sabbath observance was correct and according to divine law.

## NEH 13:15

```
======================================================================
  CONCEPT CONTEXT: Nehemiah 13:15
======================================================================

  "In those days saw I in Judah [some] treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all [manner of] burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified [against them] in the day wherein they sold victuals."

  Book: Nehemiah | Chapter: 13 | Author: Historical

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  CONCEPTS IN THIS VERSE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    PROPHET: Nabi/prophetes - spokesman, prophet
      Strong's: H7200 (saw I)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  SAME CHAPTER (Nehemiah 13) (1 verses)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Nehemiah 13:23 [PROPHET]
     "In those days also saw I Jews [that] had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab:"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  SAME BOOK (Nehemiah) (10 verses)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Nehemiah 2:17 [PROPHET]
     "Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we [are] in..."

  2. Nehemiah 4:14 [PROPHET]
     "And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles..."

  3. Nehemiah 6:14 [PROPHET]
     "My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat...and on the prophetess Noadiah..."

  4. Nehemiah 9:26 [PROPHET]
     "...and slew thy prophets which testified against them..."

  5. Nehemiah 9:30 [PROPHET]
     "...and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets..."

  [Additional verses returned from same book, same author, and other books]
```

**Observation:** The concept tool identified PROPHET (nabi/H7200 "saw") as the concept. Nehemiah acts in a prophetic role, testifying against Sabbath violation after the Babylonian captivity. The key finding for calendar continuity: Nehemiah SAW the Sabbath being violated -- he KNEW which day was the Sabbath, post-exile. The concept connections to other Nehemiah "seeing" passages (13:23, 2:17, 4:14) reinforce his role as a reformer who identified and corrected violations.
