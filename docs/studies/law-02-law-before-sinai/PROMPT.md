# Bible Study: Evidence for the Moral Law Operating from Creation to Sinai

## Question
What evidence exists for the moral law operating from creation to Sinai? Investigate the Sabbath at creation (Gen 2:2-3), Cain's murder and God's response (Gen 4:3-11), the knowledge of clean and unclean animals (Gen 7:2), Abraham keeping God's commandments, statutes, and laws (Gen 26:5), Joseph recognizing adultery as sin against God (Gen 39:9), the manna-Sabbath test before Sinai (Exo 16:4-30). If the moral law only began at Sinai, how were these pre-Sinai acts recognized as sin or obedience?

**Key findings from law-01 CONCLUSION.md:**
- E34: "Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws" (Gen 26:5) -- classified Neutral (factual observation of pre-Sinai obedience)
- E35: Joseph called adultery "this great wickedness, and sin against God" before Sinai (Gen 39:9) -- classified Neutral
- E36: "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men" (Rom 5:12-14) -- classified Neutral
- E37: Gentiles have the work of the law written on their hearts (Rom 2:14-15) -- classified Continues
- I3: "The Bible teaches that the moral law existed before its formal promulgation at Sinai and is therefore not limited to the Mosaic era" -- classified I-A (Evidence-Extending), based on E34, E35, E36
- law-01 noted this as an area requiring further investigation: "Before Sinai: Genesis 26:5 states Abraham 'kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws' -- using the same Hebrew terminology as the Sinai legislation."
- This study (law-02) is the dedicated investigation of that pre-Sinai evidence.

### Focus Areas
(Derived from tool discoveries, not training knowledge)

1. **The Hebrew vocabulary of Gen 26:5** -- Tools show that ALL FIVE key terms used in Gen 26:5 (mishmereth [H4931](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4931/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, mitsvah [H4687](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4687/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, chuqqah [H2708](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2708/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, towrah H8451) appear extensively in the Sinai legislation. Investigate whether this vocabulary overlap is coincidental or indicates the same laws.

2. **Exodus 16 as a chronological marker** -- Tools show that [H8451](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8451/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (towrah) is used in Exo 16:4 and [H4687](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4687/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (mitsvah) in Exo 16:28, BEFORE the Sinai event of Exodus 19-20. God speaks of "my law" and "my commandments" as already existing, and tests Israel on the Sabbath commandment before formally delivering the Decalogue.

3. **The verb shabath (H7673) at creation vs. the noun shabbath (H7676)** -- Tools show the verb is used in Gen 2:2-3 at creation, while the noun first appears explicitly in Exo 16:23. Investigate whether this distinction matters or whether Gen 2:2-3 establishes the Sabbath institution itself.

4. **Clean/unclean distinction in Genesis 7:2** -- Tools show [H2889](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2889/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (tahowr, "clean") is used in Gen 7:2, the earliest occurrence. This is the same word used throughout Leviticus 11 for clean animals. Noah knew the distinction before the Mosaic codification.

5. **Pre-Sinai accountability for moral acts** -- Tools show God held people accountable for murder (Gen 4:9-12; 9:5-6), sexual sin (Gen 19:1-29; 20:3; 34:5,13; 39:7-9), and general wickedness (Gen 6:5-7; 18:20) before Sinai. Nave's lists these under HOMICIDE, ADULTERY, SIN, and SODOM. This raises the question: accountability requires a standard.

6. **Romans 5:12-14 and the logical argument** -- Paul argues that "death reigned from Adam to Moses," and "sin is not imputed when there is no law" (Rom 5:13), yet death did reign -- implying a law was operative. Investigate this Pauline argument in context.

7. **Exodus 15:25-26 as a pre-Sinai statute** -- Nave's and Strong's show that God "made for them a statute (choq H2706) and an ordinance (mishpat H4941)" at Marah (Exo 15:25), BEFORE Sinai, and said "If thou wilt diligently hearken... and wilt keep all his statutes" (15:26).

8. **Pre-Sinai worship and sacrifice patterns** -- Nave's shows sacrifice offered by Abel (Gen 4:4), Noah (Gen 8:20), Abraham (Gen 12:7,8; 22), and tithes by Abraham (Gen 14:20) and Jacob (Gen 28:22) -- all before Sinai. This suggests an operative system of worship.

9. **The Abolished position's counterarguments** -- Nave's LAW topic has a "TEMPORARY" heading with passages: GAL 3:19 ("the law was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come"), ROM 5:13 ("sin is not imputed when there is no law"), JHN 1:17 ("the law was given by Moses"). Investigate whether these passages address the moral law or the codified Sinai legislation.

INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by those who say the law continues, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by those who say the law is abolished, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says. Do not use editorial characterizations like "genuine tension," "strongest argument," "most significant challenge," "honestly acknowledge," or "non-intuitive reading." Simply state what each passage says and what each side infers from it.
- When presenting findings, state: "The text says X" (explicit). Then state: "From this, Y interpretation infers Z" and "W interpretation infers V" (inferred).
- Never use language like "irrefutable," "obviously," or "clearly proves." Use "the text states," "this is consistent with."
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.
