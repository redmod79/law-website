## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### A. Creation Sabbath

#### Genesis 2:2-3
**Context:** The creation narrative. God has completed creating in six days. On the seventh day, He performs three actions regarding that day.
**Direct statement:** "On the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested [shabath, H7673] on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."
**Key observations:**
1. Three divine actions on the seventh day: rested (shabath), blessed (barak), sanctified (qadash).
2. The verb shabath (H7673) is used -- "to cease, to rest." This is the root from which the noun shabbath (H7676, "sabbath") derives.
3. "Blessed" (barak) means to endow with special favor or power. "Sanctified" (qadash) means to set apart as holy. These are not passive descriptions but active divine acts directed at a specific unit of time.
4. The text does not say God merely stopped working. It says He blessed and sanctified the seventh day. Blessing and sanctifying are acts directed outward -- they affect the object (the day itself) for purposes beyond the actor.
5. This occurs before any human nation exists. The audience is humanity ("man," created in Gen 1:26-28), not Israel.
6. The Continues position infers that blessing and sanctifying the seventh day at creation establishes the Sabbath as a creation ordinance for all humanity.
7. The Abolished position infers that the creation account describes what God did but does not command human observance; the Sabbath command first appears at Sinai (or at earliest, Exodus 16).
8. The text itself does not contain an explicit command to humans to observe the seventh day in Genesis 2:2-3. The text states what God did to the seventh day.

**Cross-references:**
- Exodus 20:8-11 explicitly grounds the Sabbath commandment in creation: "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth...and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it." The fourth commandment itself points back to Genesis 2:2-3 as its basis.
- Hebrews 4:4 quotes Genesis 2:2: "God did rest the seventh day from all his works." The author then states "there remaineth therefore a rest [sabbatismos, G4520] to the people of God" (Heb 4:9). The word sabbatismos is derived from sabbatizo ("to keep sabbath").
- Mark 2:27: Jesus states "The sabbath was made for man." The word "man" (anthropos) is generic humanity, not a specific nation. The statement that the Sabbath was "made for man" is consistent with a creation origin.

---

#### Exodus 20:8-11 (Fourth Commandment)
**Context:** The Decalogue, delivered by God's own voice at Sinai.
**Direct statement:** "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy...For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."
**Key observations:**
1. The word "Remember" (zakar) presupposes prior knowledge. The command does not say "establish" or "begin" but "remember" -- recalling something already given.
2. Verse 11 provides the reason: "For [ki] in six days the LORD made heaven and earth..." The causal conjunction ki ties the commandment directly to the creation act of Genesis 2:2-3.
3. The commandment applies to "thy stranger that is within thy gates" (v.10) -- non-Israelites are included.

**Cross-references:**
- Deuteronomy 5:12-15 adds a second motivation (the Exodus from Egypt) but does not replace the creation basis. Both motivations coexist.
- Isaiah 56:2, 6-7 extends Sabbath blessings to "the sons of the stranger" (non-Israelites).
- Isaiah 66:23 prophecies that "all flesh" will worship on the Sabbath.

---

#### Mark 2:27-28
**Context:** Jesus responding to Pharisees who challenged His disciples for plucking grain on the Sabbath.
**Direct statement:** "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath."
**Key observations:**
1. "Was made" (egeneto) indicates an originating act -- the Sabbath was made/came into being.
2. "For man" (dia ton anthropon) -- anthropos is generic humanity, not a nation-specific term.
3. Jesus does not say "the sabbath was made for Israel" or "for Jews." He says "for man."
4. The statement places the origin of the Sabbath at the origin of man, which is consistent with the creation narrative.

---

#### Hebrews 4:3-4, 9-10
**Context:** The author of Hebrews argues about entering God's rest, referencing both creation and the Exodus generation.
**Direct statement:** "For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works...There remaineth therefore a rest [sabbatismos] to the people of God."
**Key observations:**
1. The author traces the Sabbath rest to creation (v.4, quoting Gen 2:2).
2. The word sabbatismos (G4520) in v.9 is a hapax legomenon (appears only here in the NT). It is derived from sabbatizo ("to keep sabbath"). Standard Greek lexicons define it as "a Sabbath-keeping" or "a Sabbath rest."
3. The argument moves from creation rest (v.4) to the conclusion that "there remaineth therefore a sabbatismos" (v.9) -- a continuing Sabbath-keeping for God's people.

---

### B. First Prohibition and First Sin

#### Genesis 2:15-17
**Context:** God places Adam in the garden with a specific charge and a specific prohibition.
**Direct statement:** "The LORD God commanded [tsavah, H6680] the man, saying...of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."
**Key observations:**
1. The verb tsavah (H6680) is the root of mitsvah (H4687, "commandment"). The first divine prohibition uses the same verbal root as the later "commandments" of the Sinai legislation.
2. A stated penalty accompanies the prohibition: death.
3. The structure is: command + prohibition + stated penalty. This is the structure of law.
4. The word shamar (H8104) in v.15 ("keep it") is the same word used in Gen 26:5 for Abraham "keeping" God's commandments and in Deu 5:12 for "keeping" the Sabbath.

#### Genesis 3:1-19
**Context:** The serpent tempts Eve; both Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit; God confronts them and pronounces judgment.
**Direct statement:** The woman recounts the prohibition (v.3), violates it (v.6), recognizes guilt (v.7), hides from God (v.8), and God pronounces judgment (vv.14-19).
**Key observations:**
1. The sequence follows a legal pattern: (a) law given (2:16-17), (b) law violated (3:6), (c) guilt recognized (3:7-8), (d) divine investigation (3:9-13), (e) judgment pronounced (3:14-19).
2. God asks "Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded [tsavah] thee that thou shouldest not eat?" (v.11). God explicitly references the prior command.
3. The penalty is executed: death enters the human experience (3:19, confirmed by Rom 5:12).
4. This entire sequence occurs before Sinai, before Israel, before any formal code. The structure of command-violation-judgment presupposes a moral/legal framework.

---

### C. Cain's Murder and God's Response

#### Genesis 4:1-15
**Context:** Cain and Abel bring offerings. God accepts Abel's but not Cain's. Cain murders Abel. God confronts Cain.
**Direct statement:** "If thou doest not well, sin [chattath, H2403] lieth at the door" (v.7). "What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground" (v.10). "Now art thou cursed from the earth" (v.11).
**Key observations:**
1. Verse 7 uses the word "sin" (chattath, [H2403](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2403/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- from chata, H2398). This is the standard OT word for sin. Sin is named and identified before Sinai.
2. God warns Cain before the act (vv.6-7), indicating foreknowledge of moral danger and an expectation that Cain should know better.
3. After the murder, God investigates ("What hast thou done?"), pronounces a curse (v.11), and enforces a penalty (vv.11-12).
4. Cain acknowledges the justice of the punishment: "My punishment is greater than I can bear" (v.13). He does not protest that no law prohibited murder.
5. Verse 14 implies others know murder is wrong: "every one that findeth me shall slay me." Cain fears retribution, indicating a recognized standard.
6. 1 John 3:12 identifies Cain as one "who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother." John's context (3:4) defines sin as "transgression of the law." He then cites Cain (3:12) as an example. If sin is law-transgression, and Cain sinned, then the law was operative when Cain murdered Abel.

#### Genesis 9:5-6
**Context:** Post-flood instructions to Noah. God establishes the murder prohibition formally.
**Direct statement:** "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man."
**Key observations:**
1. A formal prohibition of murder with capital penalty, given to all humanity through Noah, not to Israel.
2. The basis is "the image of God" in man (v.6b) -- a creation-based rationale, not a covenant-specific one.
3. This prohibition predates Sinai and is universal in scope.

---

### D. Pre-Flood Moral Judgment

#### Genesis 6:5-9
**Context:** The state of humanity before the flood.
**Direct statement:** "GOD saw that the wickedness [ra'ah] of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil [ra'] continually" (v.5). "Noah was a just [tsaddiq] man and perfect [tamim] in his generations" (v.9).
**Key observations:**
1. God evaluates the entire pre-Sinai world using moral vocabulary: "wickedness" (ra'ah), "evil" (ra').
2. Noah is called "just" (tsaddiq) and "perfect" (tamim) -- the same vocabulary used for moral righteousness throughout the OT.
3. God judges the world for its wickedness (vv.6-7). Judgment presupposes a standard.
4. 2 Peter 2:5 calls Noah "a preacher of righteousness." Noah proclaimed a moral standard to the pre-flood world.
5. Hebrews 11:7 states Noah "condemned the world" by his faith. This condemnation implies the world was guilty against a known standard.

---

### E. Clean and Unclean Animals

#### Genesis 7:1-9
**Context:** God instructs Noah on loading the ark.
**Direct statement:** "Of every clean [tahowr, H2889] beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens...and of beasts that are not clean by two" (v.2). Noah is called "righteous" (v.1).
**Key observations:**
1. The word tahowr (H2889, "clean") appears here for the first time in the Bible. God distinguishes between clean and unclean animals.
2. God instructs based on a distinction Noah already understands -- the text does not explain the distinction; it presupposes Noah's knowledge.
3. The same word tahowr is used throughout Leviticus 11 for the dietary laws codified at Sinai.
4. The distinction serves both sacrificial and dietary purposes (confirmed by Gen 8:20).

#### Genesis 8:20-22
**Context:** After the flood, Noah's first act is worship.
**Direct statement:** "Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean [tahowr] beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar."
**Key observations:**
1. Noah sacrifices only clean animals -- the distinction is operative in worship.
2. "The LORD smelled a sweet savour" (v.21) -- God accepts the sacrifice. This is the standard language for accepted sacrifice in Leviticus.
3. The clean/unclean distinction in sacrifice and the form of burnt offerings predate Sinai.

---

### F. Sodom's Destruction

#### Genesis 13:13
**Context:** Lot chooses the Jordan plain; the narrator describes Sodom's inhabitants.
**Direct statement:** "But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners [chattaim] before the LORD exceedingly."
**Key observations:**
1. The text evaluates Sodom using moral vocabulary: "wicked" (ra') and "sinners" (chattaim -- plural of chata, H2398).
2. "Before the LORD" (liphnei YHWH) indicates the evaluation is against God's standard, not a human one.
3. This is a pre-Sinai, pre-Israelite moral evaluation of a non-Israelite city.

#### Genesis 18:19-25
**Context:** God reveals to Abraham His intention to investigate Sodom. Abraham intercedes.
**Direct statement:** "For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep [shamar] the way of the LORD, to do justice [tsedaqah] and judgment [mishpat]" (v.19). "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right [mishpat]?" (v.25).
**Key observations:**
1. Verse 19: Abraham will "command" his household to "keep the way of the LORD" and "do justice and judgment." The vocabulary (shamar, tsedaqah, mishpat) is the standard law-keeping vocabulary of the OT.
2. Verse 25: Abraham appeals to God as "the Judge of all the earth" who does "right" (mishpat). This presupposes a universal standard of justice.
3. Verse 20: Sodom's "sin" (chattath) is "very grievous." God evaluates a non-Israelite city's acts as sin before Sinai.

#### Genesis 19:1-13, 24-25
**Context:** Two angels visit Sodom; the men of the city attempt sexual assault; God destroys Sodom.
**Direct statement:** Lot says "I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly" (v.7). The angels say "the LORD hath sent us to destroy it" (v.13).
**Key observations:**
1. Lot identifies the intended act as "wicked" -- moral vocabulary.
2. The destruction is explicitly attributed to God as judgment for moral evil.
3. 2 Peter 2:6 describes this as God "making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly." The destruction serves as a moral example.
4. 2 Peter 2:8 calls the Sodomites' deeds "unlawful" (athesmos -- literally "lawless"). Peter applies law vocabulary to pre-Sinai Sodom.

#### Ezekiel 16:49-50
**Context:** God through Ezekiel identifies Sodom's specific sins.
**Direct statement:** "This was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness...neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination [to'ebah] before me."
**Key observations:**
1. Sodom's sins include: pride, excess, idleness, neglect of the poor, haughtiness, and "abomination."
2. These are moral transgressions recognizable apart from any formal code.
3. The word to'ebah ("abomination") is the standard term for grave moral offense in the OT.

---

### G. Abraham Keeping God's Laws

#### Genesis 26:5
**Context:** God speaks to Isaac, reaffirming the Abrahamic covenant, and explains why.
**Direct statement:** "Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept [shamar] my charge [mishmereth, H4931], my commandments [mitsvah, H4687], my statutes [chuqqah, H2708], and my laws [towrah, H8451]."
**Key observations:**
1. Five terms are used for what Abraham kept: voice (qol), charge (mishmereth), commandments (mitsvah), statutes (chuqqah), laws (towrah).
2. These are the same Hebrew terms used for the Sinai legislation throughout Exodus-Deuteronomy. The word study confirms that mishmereth, mitsvah, chuqqah, and towrah are the standard vocabulary of Sinai covenant obedience (cf. Deu 11:1; 1 Ki 2:3; 2 Ki 17:13).
3. The text states this as God's own testimony about Abraham -- it is God who says Abraham kept "my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
4. The Continues position infers that this vocabulary overlap indicates Abraham was keeping the same moral principles later codified at Sinai.
5. The Abolished position infers that these terms refer to the specific instructions God gave Abraham (leave your country, circumcision, sacrifice of Isaac), not the Decalogue specifically.
6. The text itself does not specify which commandments, statutes, and laws Abraham kept. It uses the comprehensive vocabulary cluster without enumerating the content.

#### Genesis 18:19
**Context:** God's testimony about Abraham before investigating Sodom.
**Direct statement:** "For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment."
**Key observations:**
1. "The way of the LORD" (derek YHWH) is a comprehensive term for God's moral will.
2. Abraham will teach his household this way -- indicating an established body of moral instruction that can be transmitted.
3. "Justice" (tsedaqah) and "judgment" (mishpat) are standard OT terms for moral/legal standards.

#### Genesis 14:18-20 (Tithe to Melchizedek)
**Context:** After rescuing Lot, Abraham meets Melchizedek, priest of God Most High.
**Direct statement:** "And he gave him tithes of all" (v.20).
**Key observations:**
1. Abraham pays tithes before Sinai, before the Levitical tithing laws.
2. Melchizedek is "priest of the most high God" before the Levitical priesthood.
3. Hebrews 7:1-10 draws theological significance from this pre-Sinai tithe.
4. This demonstrates pre-Sinai worship practices that correspond to later codified law.

---

### H. Adultery as Pre-Sinai Sin

#### Genesis 39:7-12 (Joseph)
**Context:** Joseph, a slave in Egypt, is propositioned by Potiphar's wife.
**Direct statement:** "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin [chata, H2398] against God?" (v.9).
**Key observations:**
1. Joseph calls adultery "this great wickedness" (ra'ah gedolah) and "sin against God" (chata le'Elohim).
2. He identifies adultery as sin against God, not merely as a social offense or breach of trust.
3. Joseph is in Egypt, outside any Israelite community. His moral knowledge is not attributed to national law but to a recognized standard -- sin "against God."
4. The word chata (H2398) is the standard Hebrew verb for sin.
5. This occurs generations before Sinai.

#### Genesis 20:1-7 (Abimelech warned about adultery)
**Context:** Abraham tells Abimelech that Sarah is his sister. Abimelech takes Sarah. God intervenes.
**Direct statement:** "God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife" (v.3). "I also withheld thee from sinning [chata] against me" (v.6).
**Key observations:**
1. God warns a Gentile king about adultery with a death threat.
2. God Himself calls taking another man's wife "sinning against me" (v.6) -- the same language Joseph uses in Gen 39:9.
3. Abimelech is not an Israelite; he has no covenant with God at Sinai. Yet God holds him to this standard.
4. Abimelech pleads "the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands" (v.5) -- he uses moral vocabulary, demonstrating awareness of a standard.

#### Genesis 26:9-11 (Abimelech and Isaac)
**Context:** Isaac, like his father, tells Abimelech that his wife is his sister.
**Direct statement:** Abimelech says "one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness [asham, H817] upon us" (v.10). He then commands: "He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death" (v.11).
**Key observations:**
1. The word asham (H817) is the same word used for "guilt" and "trespass offering" in the Levitical system.
2. A Philistine king enforces a death penalty for adultery before Sinai.
3. The moral awareness is not limited to Abraham's family; it extends to Gentile rulers.

#### Genesis 38:24 (Judah and Tamar)
**Context:** Judah learns that his daughter-in-law Tamar is pregnant from sexual immorality.
**Direct statement:** "Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."
**Key observations:**
1. Judah orders execution for sexual immorality before Sinai.
2. The penalty (burning) is similar to the Levitical prescription in Lev 21:9.
3. This presupposes a recognized standard and penalty for sexual transgression.

---

### I. Defilement of Dinah

#### Genesis 34:1-7, 13, 27
**Context:** Shechem (a Hivite) assaults Dinah, Jacob's daughter.
**Direct statement:** "He took her, and lay with her, and defiled [tame, H2930] her" (v.2). "He had wrought folly [nebalah] in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done" (v.7).
**Key observations:**
1. The verb tame (H2930, "defile") appears three times (vv. 2, 5, 13, 27). This is the same word used throughout Leviticus for ceremonial and moral defilement.
2. The act is called "folly" (nebalah) -- a word used for grave moral offenses in Israel (cf. Deu 22:21; Jdg 19:23; 2 Sam 13:12).
3. "Which thing ought not to be done" -- a moral evaluation presupposing a known standard.
4. Jacob's sons recognize this as a grievous transgression and respond with violent retribution.
5. This pre-Sinai moral vocabulary (tame, nebalah) is the same vocabulary used in the Sinai legislation.

---

### J. Manna-Sabbath Test Before Sinai

#### Exodus 15:25-26 (Marah Statute)
**Context:** Israel reaches Marah, where the water is bitter. God heals the water and establishes a test.
**Direct statement:** "There he made for them a statute [choq, H2706] and an ordinance [mishpat, H4941], and there he proved them" (v.25). "If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments [mitsvah], and keep all his statutes [choq]" (v.26).
**Key observations:**
1. This occurs chronologically BEFORE Sinai (Exodus 19-20). Israel has left Egypt but has not yet reached Sinai.
2. God makes a "statute and an ordinance" (choq u-mishpat) at Marah -- a formal legal act before Sinai.
3. Verse 26 references "his commandments" (mitsvah) and "his statutes" (choq) as already existing.
4. God does not say "I will give you commandments" but "give ear to his commandments" -- they are spoken of as already in existence.

#### Exodus 16:1-30 (Manna and Sabbath Test)
**Context:** Israel is in the wilderness of Sin, between Elim and Sinai. God provides manna and tests Israel's obedience.
**Direct statement:** "That I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law [towrah, H8451], or no" (v.4). "To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath [shabbath, H7676] unto the LORD" (v.23). "How long refuse ye to keep my commandments [mitsvah] and my laws [towrah]?" (v.28). "The LORD hath given you the sabbath" (v.29).
**Key observations:**
1. Verse 4: God speaks of "my law" (torati) as already existing. He tests whether Israel will "walk in" it. The test presupposes a pre-existing standard.
2. Verse 23: The first narrative use of the noun shabbath (H7676). The Sabbath institution is invoked before Sinai.
3. Verse 28: God rebukes Israel for refusing to keep "my commandments and my laws." The possessive pronouns ("my") and the rebuke for disobedience indicate these are pre-existing requirements, not new introductions.
4. Verse 29: "The LORD hath given you the sabbath." The perfect tense ("hath given") indicates a prior giving, not a present institution.
5. This entire episode precedes Sinai (Exo 19). The Sabbath is presented as a known institution being tested, not one being newly established.
6. The Abolished position may read verse 29 as the point where God first gives the Sabbath to Israel. The Continues position reads it as referencing the creation gift.
7. The text states God speaks of "my commandments and my laws" (v.28) as already existing and being violated. The text does not say "I am now giving you new commandments."

---

### K. NT Commentary on Pre-Sinai Law

#### Romans 5:12-14
**Context:** Paul's argument about sin entering through Adam and grace coming through Christ.
**Direct statement:** "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned" (v.12). "For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses" (vv.13-14).
**Key observations:**
1. Paul's argument proceeds: (a) sin entered through Adam (v.12); (b) death is the penalty for sin (v.12); (c) sin is not imputed when there is no law (v.13); (d) yet death reigned from Adam to Moses (v.14).
2. The logical chain: if sin is not imputed without law (v.13), yet people were dying from Adam to Moses (v.14), then sin was being imputed, which means a law was operative.
3. "Until the law" (achri nomou) in v.13: Paul acknowledges a period before the formal Sinai legislation. He states sin was "in the world" during this period.
4. The Continues position reads this as evidence that the moral law was operative from Adam to Moses, since sin (requiring law) was being imputed.
5. The Abolished position reads "until the law" as indicating the law began at Sinai, and people died during the Adam-to-Moses period not because of specific law-transgression but because of Adam's original sin.
6. Paul himself notes the distinction: death reigned "even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression" (v.14). These people did not violate a specific prohibition as Adam did, yet they died. Paul does not say they were sinless -- he says they sinned differently.

#### Romans 4:15
**Context:** Paul's argument about the law and transgression.
**Direct statement:** "Where no law is, there is no transgression."
**Key observations:**
1. This is a general principle stated by Paul: law is necessary for transgression to exist.
2. Combined with Rom 5:12-14 (transgression and death existed from Adam to Moses), this implies a law was operative before Sinai.
3. If there was no law before Sinai, there could be no transgression before Sinai. Yet Genesis records transgression (Cain, Sodom, etc.) and Paul affirms death reigned.

#### Romans 2:14-15
**Context:** Paul's argument that God judges impartially -- both Jews and Gentiles.
**Direct statement:** "The Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts."
**Key observations:**
1. Gentiles who never received the Sinai legislation have "the work of the law written in their hearts."
2. Their conscience "bears witness" to this law and their thoughts "accuse or excuse" them.
3. "The work of the law" (to ergon tou nomou) indicates the moral content of the law, not the entire Levitical system.
4. This passage states the moral law has a universal presence beyond the Sinai delivery. It is "written on hearts" apart from the stone tablets.

#### Galatians 3:17-19
**Context:** Paul argues about the relationship between the Abrahamic promise and the law.
**Direct statement:** "The law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul [the covenant]" (v.17). "It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come" (v.19).
**Key observations:**
1. Paul states "the law" came 430 years after Abraham.
2. "It was added because of transgressions" (v.19) -- "added" (prostithemi) means to place alongside something already existing. If the law was "added because of transgressions," then transgressions existed before the law was "added."
3. The referent of "the law" in Galatians 3 requires identification. Paul could mean: (a) the entire Sinai legislation, (b) the formal codified law-covenant, (c) the ceremonial system. The text does not specify.
4. "Till the seed should come" (v.19) introduces a temporal limitation on whatever was "added." The Continues position interprets this as the ceremonial/condemning function of the law. The Abolished position interprets this as the law itself.
5. The fact that transgressions existed before the law was "added" (v.19) is consistent with a pre-existing moral standard. *(Examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Galatians 3.)*

#### 1 John 3:4, 12
**Context:** John's discussion of sin and righteousness.
**Direct statement:** "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law" (v.4). "Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother...because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous" (v.12).
**Key observations:**
1. Verse 4 defines sin as "the transgression of the law" (he anomia -- lawlessness).
2. Verse 12 cites Cain as an example of evil. Cain's works were "evil" (poneros) and Abel's were "righteous" (dikaios).
3. If sin = law-transgression (v.4), and Cain sinned (v.12), then the law was operative when Cain acted. Cain lived before Sinai.
4. The logical connection: John's definition of sin + his pre-Sinai example = the law was operative before Sinai.

#### Hebrews 11:4, 7
**Context:** The "faith chapter" -- examples of faith from pre-Sinai figures.
**Direct statement:** "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous" (v.4). "By faith Noah...condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith" (v.7).
**Key observations:**
1. Abel is called "righteous" -- a moral evaluation of a pre-Sinai figure.
2. Noah "condemned the world" -- the world was guilty, implying a standard against which it was measured.
3. 2 Peter 2:5 calls Noah "a preacher of righteousness" -- he proclaimed a moral standard.

#### John 1:17
**Context:** John's prologue, contrasting the old and new dispensations.
**Direct statement:** "For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."
**Key observations:**
1. The text states "the law was given by Moses."
2. The Abolished position cites this as evidence the law began with Moses.
3. The Continues position notes this refers to the formal giving/codification at Sinai through Moses, not the first existence of moral principles. Genesis 26:5 uses the same term "law" (towrah) for what Abraham kept before Moses.
4. The preposition "by" (dia) indicates Moses as the instrument of giving, not necessarily the originator of the law's content.

### L. Additional Cross-References

#### Isaiah 56:2, 4-7; 58:13-14; 66:23
**Context:** Prophetic passages about the Sabbath's scope.
**Key observations:**
1. Isaiah 56:6-7 extends Sabbath blessings to "the sons of the stranger" -- non-Israelites.
2. Isaiah 66:23 prophecies "all flesh" worshipping on the Sabbath.
3. These universal references are consistent with a creation-origin Sabbath rather than an Israel-specific institution.

#### Ezekiel 20:12, 20
**Context:** God reviews Israel's history and the Sabbath's role.
**Direct statement:** "I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them."
**Key observations:**
1. God calls them "my sabbaths" -- they belong to God, not to any nation.
2. They are a "sign" of the sanctifying relationship between God and His people.

#### 2 Peter 2:5-8
**Context:** Peter cites pre-Sinai examples of divine judgment and deliverance.
**Direct statement:** "Saved Noah...a preacher of righteousness...turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes...making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly...delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful [athesmos] deeds)."
**Key observations:**
1. Peter calls pre-Sinai deeds "unlawful" (athesmos) -- literally "lawless" or "contrary to law."
2. Noah is "a preacher of righteousness" in the pre-Sinai world.
3. Lot is "righteous" and the Sodomites are "wicked" and "ungodly."
4. Peter applies law-related vocabulary (unlawful, righteous, ungodly) to pre-Sinai events.

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Pre-Sinai Moral Vocabulary
The same Hebrew terms for sin, righteousness, law, commandment, statute, clean, unclean, and defile appear in pre-Sinai narratives using the same words later codified at Sinai:
- chattath/chata (sin): Gen 4:7; 20:6; 39:9
- tsaddiq (righteous): Gen 6:9; 7:1; 18:23, 25
- ra'/ra'ah (evil/wicked): Gen 6:5; 13:13; 19:7
- tahowr (clean): Gen 7:2; 8:20
- tame (defile): Gen 34:2, 5, 13, 27
- nebalah (folly): Gen 34:7
- asham (guilt): Gen 26:10
- shamar (keep): Gen 2:15; 18:19; 26:5
- mitsvah (commandment): Gen 26:5; Exo 15:26; 16:28
- towrah (law): Gen 26:5; Exo 16:4, 28
- chuqqah/choq (statute): Gen 26:5; Exo 15:25
- mishpat (judgment): Gen 18:25; Exo 15:25

### Pattern 2: Divine Judgment Before Sinai
God judges moral transgression throughout the pre-Sinai period:
- Adam and Eve expelled from Eden (Gen 3)
- Cain cursed for murder (Gen 4)
- The world destroyed by flood for wickedness (Gen 6-7)
- Sodom destroyed for sin (Gen 19)
- Abimelech warned about adultery with a death threat (Gen 20)

In every case, God holds people accountable for moral acts. Accountability presupposes a standard.

### Pattern 3: Non-Israelites Held to the Same Standard
The moral standard is applied to non-Israelites before Sinai:
- Cain (pre-Israelite): judged for murder (Gen 4)
- The pre-flood world (pre-Israelite): judged for wickedness (Gen 6-7)
- Sodom (non-Israelite): judged for sin (Gen 18-19)
- Abimelech (Philistine): warned about adultery (Gen 20)
- 2 Peter 2:8 calls Sodomites' deeds "unlawful" (athesmos)
- Romans 2:14-15: Gentiles have the work of the law written on their hearts

### Pattern 4: Pre-Sinai References to "My Law" and "My Commandments"
God speaks of His law and commandments as already existing before Sinai:
- Gen 26:5: Abraham kept "my commandments, my statutes, and my laws"
- Exo 15:26: "give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes"
- Exo 16:4: "whether they will walk in my law"
- Exo 16:28: "How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?"

In each case, the possessive pronoun ("my") and the context indicate pre-existing requirements, not new ones being introduced.

### Pattern 5: The Sabbath Traced from Creation Through Pre-Sinai to Sinai
- Gen 2:2-3: God rests (shabath), blesses, and sanctifies the seventh day at creation
- Exo 16:23-29: The Sabbath (shabbath) is invoked and tested before Sinai
- Exo 20:8-11: The fourth commandment says "Remember" and grounds the Sabbath in creation
- Mark 2:27: Jesus says the Sabbath "was made for man"
- Heb 4:4, 9: The author traces a continuing sabbatismos to creation

## Connections Between Passages

### The Romans 5:12-14 Logical Chain
Paul's argument in Romans 5:12-14 provides a logical framework for understanding the pre-Sinai evidence in Genesis. Paul states: (a) sin is not imputed without law (5:13); (b) death (the penalty for sin) reigned from Adam to Moses (5:14). The Genesis narratives provide the specific instances: Cain's murder (Gen 4), the flood (Gen 6-7), Sodom (Gen 18-19), Joseph's recognition of adultery as sin (Gen 39:9). Paul's logical argument and the Genesis narratives are mutually reinforcing.

### 1 John 3:4 + 1 John 3:12
John's definition of sin (v.4: "sin is the transgression of the law") followed by his citation of Cain (v.12) creates a direct link between the definition and a pre-Sinai example. If John's definition is universal (and "whosoever" in v.4 indicates it is), then the law was operative when Cain sinned.

### Genesis 26:5 Vocabulary and the Sinai Legislation
The five terms in Gen 26:5 (voice, charge, commandments, statutes, laws) form the exact vocabulary cluster used for the Sinai covenant. Cross-testament parallels confirm: Deu 30:10 (score 0.496), Deu 28:15 (0.487), 1 Ki 2:3 (0.484), Exo 16:28 (0.425) all use the same vocabulary. This is not a coincidence of a few shared words but a comprehensive overlap of the entire law-vocabulary cluster.

### Creation Sabbath to Fourth Commandment
The fourth commandment (Exo 20:8-11) explicitly connects itself to creation (Gen 2:2-3). The commandment says "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth...and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it." The "wherefore" (al ken) links the creation act to the commandment. The manna-Sabbath test (Exo 16) provides the chronological bridge: the Sabbath is invoked between creation and Sinai.

## Word Study Insights

### Sabbath Verb vs. Noun
The verb shabath (H7673, "to cease/rest") appears at creation (Gen 2:2-3). The noun shabbath (H7676, "sabbath") first appears in Exo 16:23. The Abolished position may argue the noun's absence from Genesis indicates the Sabbath institution was not established at creation. The Continues position notes that the verb describes the action that the noun later names, and that Exo 20:11 explicitly connects the creation verb to the commandment. The fourth commandment itself bridges the two: "the LORD...rested [shabath, verb] the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath [shabbath, noun] day."

### The Gen 26:5 Vocabulary Cluster
Four technical legal terms co-occur in Gen 26:5: mishmereth, mitsvah, chuqqah, towrah. These four terms are the standard terms for the Sinai legislation. Their co-occurrence in a single pre-Sinai verse, applied to Abraham's obedience, is a textual datum. Whether this indicates Abraham kept the same content later codified at Sinai, or merely that the author used later vocabulary to describe Abraham's obedience, is a question of interpretation.

### Clean/Unclean (tahowr/tame)
The word tahowr (H2889) first appears in Gen 7:2. The verb tame (H2930) first appears in Gen 34:5. Both are standard Levitical vocabulary used extensively in the Sinai legislation. Their pre-Sinai appearance indicates these categories were operative before codification.

### Sin Terminology Before Sinai
The word chattath (H2403, "sin") appears in Gen 4:7 -- the earliest occurrence. The verb chata (H2398) appears in Gen 20:6 and 39:9. The vocabulary of sin is operative throughout the pre-Sinai period.

## Difficult Passages

### John 1:17: "The law was given by Moses"
This verse states the law "was given by Moses." If taken to mean the law began with Moses, it creates tension with the pre-Sinai evidence (Gen 26:5; Exo 16:4, 28). The verse uses the preposition dia ("through/by"), indicating Moses as the agent of formal delivery. Gen 26:5 uses towrah ("law") for what Abraham kept before Moses. The text can be read as: the formal codified law was given through Moses, while the moral content existed earlier.

### Galatians 3:17, 19: "The law, which was 430 years after"
Paul states the law came 430 years after the Abrahamic covenant and was "added because of transgressions." If this means the moral law began 430 years after Abraham, it conflicts with Gen 26:5, Exo 16:4, 28. The referent of "the law" in Galatians 3 is not specified as the moral law vs. the formal Sinai legislation vs. the ceremonial system. "Added because of transgressions" presupposes transgressions existed before the law was "added" -- which itself implies a prior standard. *(Examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Galatians 3.)*

### Romans 5:13: "Sin is not imputed when there is no law"
Paul states this principle, then notes "nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses." The tension Paul himself creates is: if sin is not imputed without law, yet people died (the penalty for sin), then either (a) a law was operative, or (b) death resulted from Adam's sin being imputed to his descendants apart from individual law-transgression. Paul addresses this by noting that those between Adam and Moses "had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression" (v.14) -- they sinned differently, but they sinned. Both readings acknowledge sin existed before Sinai.

### The Absence of an Explicit Sabbath Command in Genesis 2
The text of Genesis 2:2-3 describes what God did (rested, blessed, sanctified) but does not contain an explicit command to humans to observe the seventh day. The command first appears in Exodus 16 (pre-Sinai) and then formally in Exodus 20:8-11. The Abolished position cites this absence as evidence the Sabbath was not commanded at creation. The Continues position notes that Genesis 2:2-3 records the institution (blessing and sanctifying a day for a purpose beyond God's own rest), and the fourth commandment explicitly roots itself in this creation act.
