# What Evidence Exists for the Moral Law Operating from Creation to Sinai?

## Question
What evidence exists for the moral law operating from creation to Sinai? Investigate the Sabbath at creation (Gen 2:2-3), Cain's murder and God's response (Gen 4:3-11), the knowledge of clean and unclean animals (Gen 7:2), Abraham keeping God's commandments, statutes, and laws (Gen 26:5), Joseph recognizing adultery as sin against God (Gen 39:9), the manna-Sabbath test before Sinai (Exo 16:4-30). If the moral law only began at Sinai, how were these pre-Sinai acts recognized as sin or obedience?

## Summary Answer
The Bible contains extensive evidence of moral standards operating from creation through the pre-Sinai period. Six categories of evidence converge: (1) God's three actions on the seventh day at creation (rested, blessed, sanctified -- Gen 2:2-3), grounded as the basis of the fourth commandment by Exodus 20:11; (2) divine judgment of moral transgression throughout the pre-Sinai period (Cain, the flood, Sodom); (3) the clean/unclean animal distinction known to Noah before its Levitical codification (Gen 7:2); (4) Abraham keeping God's "commandments, statutes, and laws" using the same vocabulary as the Sinai legislation (Gen 26:5); (5) Joseph and Abimelech recognizing adultery as "sin against God" before Sinai (Gen 39:9; 20:6); and (6) God testing Israel on "my law" and "my commandments" including the Sabbath before reaching Sinai (Exo 16:4, 28). Paul's argument in Romans 5:12-14 provides the logical framework: if sin is not imputed without law, yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, then a law was operative.

## Key Verses

God called it "sinning against me." | Gen 20:3, 6 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: God held a non-Israelite to moral standards before Sinai and called adultery "sinning against me.") | E077 |
| E16 | "Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge [mishmereth], my commandments [mitsvah], my statutes [chuqqah], and my laws [towrah]." These are the same Hebrew terms used for the Sinai legislation. | Gen 26:5 | Neutral | V1: The verse uses "commandments" and "laws" -- vocabulary associated with the law. However, the verse does not contain continuation or cessation vocabulary; it is a factual observation about Abraham's pre-Sinai obedience. Both sides accept that the text says Abraham kept God's commandments before Sinai. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. -> Master E034 (already exists). | E034 |
| E17 | Abimelech the Philistine recognized adultery brings "guiltiness" (asham, H817) and enforced a death penalty: "He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death." | Gen 26:10-11 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: a Gentile enforced moral standards before Sinai.) | E078 |

| E20 | Joseph called adultery "this great wickedness, and sin [chata] against God." | Gen 39:9 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. -> Master E035 (already exists). | E035 |
| E21 | God made "a statute [choq, H2706] and an ordinance [mishpat, H4941]" at Marah, before Sinai. God referenced "his commandments [mitsvah]" and "his statutes [choq]" as already existing. | Exo 15:25-26 | Neutral | V1: No continuation/cessation vocabulary. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: legal enactment before Sinai, referencing pre-existing commandments.) | E081 |
| E22 | God said "that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law [towrah], or no" -- before Sinai. | Exo 16:4 | Neutral | V1: No continuation/cessation vocabulary. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: God speaks of "my law" as already existing before Sinai.) | E082 |
| E23 | "To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath [shabbath, H7676] unto the LORD." First narrative use of the noun shabbath, before Sinai. | Exo 16:23 | Neutral | V1: "Sabbath" (creation/Decalogue context) vocabulary is present. But the statement is a factual observation about when the noun first appears in narrative. Both sides accept the Sabbath is invoked here before Sinai. V2: No. -> Neutral. (Factual observation: the Sabbath institution is referenced before Sinai.) | E083 |
| E24 | "How long refuse ye to keep my commandments [mitsvah] and my laws [towrah]?" God rebukes Israel for violating pre-existing "commandments" and "laws" before Sinai. | Exo 16:28 | Neutral | V1: No continuation/cessation vocabulary. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: God speaks of "my commandments and my laws" as already existing, and rebukes violation, before Sinai.) | E084 |
| E25 | "The LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days." The perfect tense ("hath given") indicates a prior giving. | Exo 16:29 | Neutral | V1: "Sabbath" vocabulary, but the verse is a factual statement about when the Sabbath was given. Both sides accept this text. V2: No. -> Neutral. | E085 |
| E26 | The fourth commandment says "Remember the sabbath day" and grounds it in creation: "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth...and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it." | Exo 20:8-11 | Continues | V1: YES -- "Remember the sabbath day" is Sabbath (creation/Decalogue context) vocabulary; "keep it holy" is commandment-keeping vocabulary. -> Candidate CONTINUES. Gate 1 (Subject/Object): PASS -- the subject is explicitly the Sabbath of the Decalogue, identified by the creation basis (v.11). Gate 2 (Grammar): PASS -- imperative mood, no alternative parsing. Gate 3 (Genre): PASS -- legal/didactic (the Decalogue). Gate 4 (Harmony): No conflicting E-item. PASS. -> CONTINUES. -> Master E086 (new). | E086 |
| E27 | Jesus states: "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath." The word "man" (anthropos) is generic humanity. | Mrk 2:27 | Neutral | V1: "Sabbath" vocabulary is present. But the statement "was made for man" is a factual declaration about the Sabbath's purpose and audience. Both sides accept this is what Jesus said. The classification of "for man" as universal vs. Israel-specific is an inference. V2: No. -> Neutral. | E087 |
| E28 | The author of Hebrews quotes Gen 2:2 ("God did rest the seventh day from all his works") and concludes: "There remaineth therefore a rest [sabbatismos, G4520] to the people of God." | Heb 4:4, 9 | Continues | V1: YES -- "there remaineth a sabbatismos" traces a continuing Sabbath-keeping from creation. "Sabbath" (creation/Decalogue context) vocabulary + "remaineth" = continuation. -> Candidate CONTINUES. Gate 1: PASS -- the subject is the Sabbath rest, traced to creation. Gate 2: PASS -- indicative mood, "remaineth" (apoleipetai). Gate 3: PASS -- didactic epistle. Gate 4: No conflicting E-item. PASS. -> CONTINUES. | E088 |

| E33 | "The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ." | Jhn 1:17 | Neutral | V1: No continuation/cessation vocabulary. The statement attributes the law's formal giving to Moses. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: the text states the law was given by/through Moses.) | E090 |
| E34 | "The law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul [the covenant]...It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come." | Gal 3:17, 19 | Neutral | V2: "added...till" is temporal vocabulary. -> Candidate ABOLISHED. Gate 1: "The law" -- referent is ambiguous (which law?). GATE 1 FAIL. -> Step 3: RC2 -- "Paul states something was 'added because of transgressions, till the seed should come'; the specific referent is not identified." RC3 -- Neither V1 nor V2 applies to a clearly identified law. -> Neutral. -> Master E058 (already exists). | E058 |
| E35 | "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law." | 1Jn 3:4 | Continues | -> Master E023 (already exists, classified Continues). | E023 |
| E36 | "Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother...because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous." John cites a pre-Sinai figure as example of evil in the context of his definition of sin as law-transgression (v.4). | 1Jn 3:12 | Neutral | V1: No continuation/cessation vocabulary in v.12 itself. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: John cites a pre-Sinai figure as an example of evil.) | E091 |
| E37 | Abel is called "righteous" and his sacrifice is called "more excellent." Noah "condemned the world" and is called "heir of the righteousness which is by faith." | Heb 11:4, 7 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: pre-Sinai figures receive moral evaluation in the NT.) | E092 |
| E38 | Peter calls the pre-flood world "the world of the ungodly," Noah "a preacher of righteousness," Sodom an "ensample unto those that after should live ungodly," and Lot "righteous." The Sodomites' deeds are called "unlawful" (athesmos). | 2Pe 2:5-8 | Neutral | V1: No explicit continuation/cessation vocabulary for the law. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: Peter applies law-related vocabulary -- "unlawful," "righteous," "ungodly" -- to pre-Sinai events.) | E093 |
| E39 | Ezekiel identifies Sodom's specific sins: "pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness...neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me." | Eze 16:49-50 | Neutral | V1: No. V2: No. Both NO -> Neutral. (Factual observation: specific moral offenses identified for a pre-Sinai city.) | E094 |
| E40 | Isaiah extends Sabbath blessings to "the sons of the stranger" (non-Israelites): "every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant." | Isa 56:6-7 | Continues | V1: YES -- "keepeth the sabbath" applied universally (including non-Israelites). -> Candidate CONTINUES. Gate 1: PASS -- the subject is the Sabbath, specifically identified. Gate 2: PASS -- conditional construction. Gate 3: PASS -- prophetic direct speech. Gate 4: No conflict. PASS. -> CONTINUES. | E095 |
| E41 | "From one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD." Future prophecy with universal scope. | Isa 66:23 | Continues | V1: YES -- Sabbath worship by "all flesh" in future prophecy. -> Candidate CONTINUES. Gate 1: PASS -- the subject is Sabbath worship. Gate 2: PASS -- future indicative. Gate 3: PASS -- prophetic direct speech from God. Gate 4: No conflict. PASS. -> CONTINUES. | E096 |
| E42 | "I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them." God calls them "my sabbaths." | Eze 20:12 | Neutral | V1: "My sabbaths" -- Sabbath vocabulary. But the verse is a factual statement about the Sabbath being a sign; both sides accept this. V2: No. -> Neutral. (Both sides accept the Sabbath was given as a sign. The question of when it was first given and whether it continues is not addressed by this verse alone.) | E097 |

Each N-item below has been processed through **Tree 1 (N-CHECK)**, **Tree 4 (Gate 0: three N-tier tests)**, then **Tree 3 (Vocabulary Scan + Four Validation Gates)**.

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Why Unavoidable | Tree 4 / Tree 3 Trace | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The clean/unclean animal distinction existed before the Levitical codification (Lev 11), since God instructs Noah to differentiate between clean and unclean animals in Gen 7:2 using the same term (tahowr, H2889) later used in the Levitical laws. | E8 (Gen 7:2), E9 (Gen 8:20) | Neutral | E8 states God instructed Noah about clean/unclean animals. E9 states Noah sacrificed clean animals. The Levitical codification (Lev 11) uses the same word tahowr. The distinction existed before the codification. No reader can deny that the distinction was operative for Noah before Leviticus. | Gate 0: N-Test 1 (Universal): YES -- both positions acknowledge Noah knew clean/unclean before Leviticus. N-Test 2: YES -- only possible reading. N-Test 3: YES. PASS. -> Tree 3: V1 No, V2 No -> Neutral. | N006 |
| N2 | God held people accountable for moral acts before Sinai, since He judged Cain for murder (E5), the pre-flood world for wickedness (E6), Sodom for sin (E14), and Abimelech for potential adultery (E15). | E5, E6, E14, E15 | Neutral | Each E-item records divine judgment for moral acts before Sinai. That God held people accountable for these acts follows directly from the fact that He judged them. No reader can deny that these texts record pre-Sinai divine judgment. | Gate 0: N-Test 1: YES -- both positions acknowledge God judged these acts. The disagreement is about the source/nature of the standard, not the fact of judgment. N-Test 2: YES. N-Test 3: YES. PASS. -> Tree 3: V1 No, V2 No -> Neutral. | N007 |
| N3 | The Hebrew terms for "commandments" (mitsvah), "statutes" (chuqqah), "laws" (towrah), and "charge" (mishmereth) in Gen 26:5 are the same terms used for the Sinai legislation throughout Exodus-Deuteronomy. | E16/E034 (Gen 26:5), word studies (H4687, [H2708](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2708/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, [H8451](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8451/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, H4931) | Neutral | This is a lexical observation. The same Hebrew words appear in Gen 26:5 and in the Sinai legislation. Both sides acknowledge this vocabulary overlap. Whether the content Abraham kept was identical to the Sinai content is a separate question (an inference). | Gate 0: N-Test 1: YES -- both positions acknowledge the same Hebrew terms are used. N-Test 2: YES -- the only possible reading. N-Test 3: YES -- no concept added beyond the lexical fact. PASS. -> Tree 3: V1 No, V2 No -> Neutral. | N008 |
| N4 | God speaks of "my law" (towrah) and "my commandments" (mitsvah) as already existing before the Sinai event (Exo 19-20), since Exo 16:4 says "my law" and Exo 16:28 says "my commandments and my laws" in a pre-Sinai context. | E22 (Exo 16:4), E24 (Exo 16:28) | Neutral | E22 and E24 both record God referencing "my law" and "my commandments" before the Sinai event. The chronological context is the wilderness of Sin, before reaching Mount Sinai. Both sides accept that these references occur in the pre-Sinai narrative. Whether these refer to the Decalogue content or to other instructions is a separate question. | Gate 0: N-Test 1: YES -- both positions acknowledge the chronological context. N-Test 2: YES. N-Test 3: YES. PASS. -> Tree 3: V1 No, V2 No -> Neutral. | N009 |
| N5 | The fourth commandment (Exo 20:8-11) explicitly grounds itself in the creation event of Genesis 2:2-3, since it states "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth...and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it." | E26 (Exo 20:8-11), E1 (Gen 2:2-3) | Neutral | The fourth commandment itself provides the causal link to creation with the word "wherefore" (al ken). Both sides acknowledge that the text connects the Sabbath to creation. Whether this means the Sabbath was commanded at creation or merely references creation as the pattern is a separate question (an inference). | Gate 0: N-Test 1: YES -- both positions acknowledge the textual connection to creation. N-Test 2: YES. N-Test 3: YES. PASS. -> Tree 3: V1 No, V2 No -> Neutral. | N010 |
| N6 | Paul's argument in Romans 5:12-14 presupposes that some form of law was operative from Adam to Moses, since he states both that "sin is not imputed when there is no law" (v.13) and that "death reigned from Adam to Moses" (v.14) -- death being the penalty for sin. | E029/E036 (Rom 5:12-14), E031/E089 (Rom 4:15) | Neutral | **N-Test 1:** Would both sides agree? The Continues position accepts this. The Abolished position may argue that death reigned because of Adam's imputed sin, not because of individual law-transgression. Paul himself notes the distinction in v.14 ("even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression"). The Abolished scholar could argue the death is from Adam's sin, not from a pre-Sinai moral code. **N-Test 1: FAIL** -- a scholar from the Abolished position could deny the specific conclusion that "a law was operative" (arguing instead for imputed Adamic sin). -> Reclassify as I. | -- | -- |

### 3. Inferences Table

Each I-item below has been processed through **Tree 2 (I-Type Classification)** and **Tree 5 (I-Item Positional Classification)**.

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | Paul's argument in Romans 5:12-14 demonstrates that a moral law was operative from Adam to Moses, since sin requires law for imputation and death (the penalty for sin) reigned during that period. | I-A | E029/E036: "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin...death reigned from Adam to Moses" (Rom 5:12-14). E031/E089: "Where no law is, there is no transgression" (Rom 4:15). E030: "Sin is not imputed when there is no law...nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses" (Rom 5:13-14). | Systematizing Paul's statements into the conclusion that a "moral law was operative from Adam to Moses." Paul states the premises; the conclusion that the law was a specifically moral code operative throughout the entire period involves a step of systematization. An Abolished scholar could argue death reigned because of Adam's imputed sin (Rom 5:18-19), not because individuals violated a pre-Sinai moral law. | #5 (systematizing Paul's premises into a doctrinal conclusion) | I009 |
| I2 | The Bible teaches that the moral law existed before its formal promulgation at Sinai and is therefore not limited to the Mosaic era. | I-A | E034 (Gen 26:5): Abraham kept "my commandments, my statutes, and my laws" before Sinai. E035 (Gen 39:9): Joseph called adultery "sin against God" before Sinai. E036 (Rom 5:12-14): Sin and death from Adam to Moses. E064 (Gen 2:16-17): First prohibition with penalty before Sinai. E066 (Gen 4:7): "Sin" named before Sinai. E082 (Exo 16:4): God speaks of "my law" before Sinai. E084 (Exo 16:28): God speaks of "my commandments and my laws" before Sinai. | Each E-item individually shows moral awareness, law vocabulary, or divine judgment before Sinai. The claim that this means the moral law PRE-EXISTED Sinai and is NOT LIMITED to the Mosaic era systematizes these observations into a broader doctrinal position. | #5 (systematizing multiple E-items) | I003 (already exists -- update "Also In") |
| I3 | The Bible teaches that the Sabbath is a creation ordinance, not merely a Sinai institution, because: (a) God rested, blessed, and sanctified the seventh day at creation; (b) the fourth commandment explicitly grounds itself in creation; (c) the Sabbath was tested before Sinai; (d) Jesus said the Sabbath was made for "man" (anthropos, humanity); (e) Hebrews traces a continuing sabbatismos from creation. | I-A | E063 (Gen 2:2-3): God rested, blessed, sanctified the seventh day. E086 (Exo 20:8-11): "Remember...for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth." E083 (Exo 16:23): Sabbath invoked before Sinai. E087 (Mrk 2:27): "The sabbath was made for man." E088 (Heb 4:4, 9): sabbatismos remains from creation. N010: Fourth commandment grounds itself in creation. | Each E-item and N-item addresses one aspect. The claim that the Sabbath is a "creation ordinance" (not merely a Sinai institution) systematizes these into a comprehensive doctrinal position. The text of Gen 2:2-3 describes God's actions but does not explicitly command human observance. The systematization that blessing + sanctifying = institution for humans involves reasoning. | #5 (systematizing multiple E/N items into a doctrinal position) | I010 |
| I4 | The pre-Sinai law vocabulary in Genesis 26:5 (mishmereth, mitsvah, chuqqah, towrah) indicates Abraham kept the same moral content later codified at Sinai, because the same technical terms are used. | I-B | FOR: E034 (Gen 26:5 uses Sinai vocabulary -- mitsvah, chuqqah, towrah, mishmereth). N008 (the Hebrew terms are the same). E082 (Exo 16:4: "my law" before Sinai). E084 (Exo 16:28: "my commandments and my laws" before Sinai). E081 (Exo 15:25-26: statute at Marah). AGAINST: E090 (Jhn 1:17: "the law was given by Moses"). E058 (Gal 3:17, 19: the law came 430 years after Abraham, was "added"). The vocabulary overlap could reflect the narrator's use of later terminology to describe Abraham's obedience (a literary convention), not necessarily that Abraham knew the Decalogue. | The claim that the same vocabulary = same content goes beyond the lexical observation (N008). The vocabulary could reflect: (a) identical content, or (b) the narrator's use of later legal terms to describe earlier obedience. The text does not specify which commandments Abraham kept. Choosing between these readings requires interpretive judgment. | #2 (choosing between two readings of the vocabulary overlap); #5 (systematizing) | I011 |
| I5 | The pre-Sinai law vocabulary in Genesis 26:5 describes only the specific instructions God gave Abraham personally (leave your country, circumcision, sacrifice of Isaac), not the Decalogue content. | I-B | FOR: E090 (Jhn 1:17: the law was given by Moses). E058 (Gal 3:17, 19: the law came 430 years after Abraham, was "added"). AGAINST: E034 (Gen 26:5 uses comprehensive law vocabulary -- four distinct terms suggesting a body of law, not isolated commands). N008 (same terms as Sinai legislation). E082, E084 (God speaks of "my law" and "my commandments" as pre-existing before Sinai). E077 (God held Gentile Abimelech to the adultery standard before Sinai). | The claim that Gen 26:5 refers only to Abraham's personal commands requires limiting the comprehensive vocabulary (four distinct law terms) to specific individual instructions. The text uses the same language the OT uses for the entire body of divine law. Restricting these terms to personal commands requires an interpretive choice. | #2 (choosing between readings); #1 (adding the concept that the comprehensive vocabulary is limited to personal commands) | I012 |
| I6 | The Bible teaches that God's moral standards are universal, applied to all humans regardless of covenant status, because God held non-Israelites (Cain, pre-flood world, Sodom, Abimelech, Shechem) accountable for moral acts before Sinai and before Israel existed. | I-A | E065 (Gen 3: Adam judged). E067 (Gen 4: Cain judged). E068 (Gen 6: world judged). E076 (Gen 19: Sodom judged). E077 (Gen 20: Abimelech warned). E037 (Rom 2:14-15: Gentiles have the work of the law written in their hearts). | Each E-item records divine moral judgment of non-Israelites. The claim that this demonstrates the moral standards are "universal" systematizes these observations. The individual texts record judgment; the claim that this constitutes a universal moral law binding on all humans regardless of covenant status involves systematization. | #5 (systematizing) | I004 (already exists -- update "Also In") |
| I7 | The pre-Sinai evidence does not demonstrate a "moral law" operative before Sinai but only shows God's sovereign right to judge as He sees fit, without a formal law code. God acted according to His will, not according to a pre-existing code that humans were expected to know. | I-D | AGAINST: E066 (Gen 4:7: God warned Cain about "sin" before the act -- presupposing a known standard). E034 (Gen 26:5: Abraham kept "my commandments, my statutes, and my laws" -- God's own testimony). E082, E084 (Exo 16:4, 28: God speaks of "my law" and "my commandments" as pre-existing). E077 (Gen 20:3, 6: God held Abimelech to the adultery standard and called it "sinning against me"). E093 (2Pe 2:8: Sodomites' deeds called "unlawful"). | This claim requires overriding God's own statement that Abraham kept "my commandments, my statutes, and my laws" (E034), God's warning to Cain about "sin" (E066), God's reference to "my law" and "my commandments" before Sinai (E082, E084), God's statement to Abimelech that taking another man's wife is "sinning against me" (E077), and Peter's use of "unlawful" for Sodomite acts (E093). Each of these texts presupposes a knowable standard. The claim that no standard existed requires these texts to mean something other than what they state. | #1 (adding the concept that God's judgments are arbitrary rather than based on a knowable standard, when the texts say otherwise); #3 (applying a framework of divine sovereignty without moral law) | I013 |
| I8 | The formal Sinai legislation was the codification of moral principles that already existed, not the creation of new moral standards. | I-A | E034 (Gen 26:5: Abraham already kept commandments, statutes, laws before Sinai). E082, E084 (Exo 16:4, 28: "my law" and "my commandments" as pre-existing before Sinai). E081 (Exo 15:25-26: statute at Marah before Sinai). N008 (same terms). N010 (fourth commandment grounds itself in creation). E036 (Rom 5:12-14: sin/death from Adam to Moses presupposes law). | Each E/N item shows moral principles, law vocabulary, or divine judgment operating before Sinai. The claim that Sinai was a "codification" of "already existing" principles -- rather than a mixture of new and old -- systematizes these observations. The text does not use the word "codification." Some elements of the Sinai legislation may have been new (ceremonial details, civic regulations) while others pre-existed. | #5 (systematizing); #1 (adding the concept of "codification" which the text does not use) | I014 |

### I-B Resolution: I4 -- Gen 26:5 Vocabulary Indicates Same Content as Sinai

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (same content): E034 (Gen 26:5 uses four distinct Sinai-law terms), N008 (same Hebrew terms), E082 (Exo 16:4: "my law" before Sinai), E084 (Exo 16:28: "my commandments and my laws"), E081 (Exo 15:25-26: statute at Marah), E077 (adultery standard applied to Gentiles before Sinai), E035 (Joseph: adultery = sin against God).
- AGAINST (different content/literary convention): E090 (Jhn 1:17: law given by Moses), E058 (Gal 3:17, 19: law added 430 years after Abraham).

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E034 | Plain | Direct statement by God about Abraham. Uses four distinct technical terms. |
| N008 | Plain | Lexical observation that both sides can verify. |
| E082 | Plain | Direct divine speech: "my law." |
| E084 | Plain | Direct divine speech: "my commandments and my laws." |
| E081 | Plain | Narrative records a statute made at Marah. |
| E077 | Plain | Direct divine speech to Abimelech about adultery. |
| E035 | Plain | Joseph's direct statement about sin against God. |
| E090 | Contextually Clear | "The law was given by Moses" -- direct statement, but "given" (dia) could mean formal delivery, not origination. |
| E058 | Ambiguous | "The law" in Gal 3:19 has an ambiguous referent (which law?). "Added" could mean the formal codification was added to the existing promise, not that moral content was newly created. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR side: Multiple Plain statements (E034, N008, E082, E084, E081, E077, E035) -- 7 items at Plain level.
AGAINST side: One Contextually Clear (E090) and one Ambiguous (E058).
The FOR side has substantially more Plain statements.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements determine the reading of the Ambiguous ones. E034 (Plain: God says Abraham kept commandments, statutes, and laws) and E082/E084 (Plain: God speaks of pre-existing "my law" and "my commandments") govern the reading of E058 (Ambiguous: "the law...added"). If God already had "commandments" and "laws" that Abraham kept (E034) and that existed before Sinai (E082, E084), then "the law" that was "added" in Gal 3:19 is most consistently read as the formal codification/covenant-administration, not the first existence of moral content. E090 (Jhn 1:17: "the law was given by Moses") is consistent: the formal giving was through Moses, while the moral content pre-existed.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate**
Plain statements on the FOR side dominate. The AGAINST side relies on one Contextually Clear passage and one Ambiguous passage. The weight of Plain evidence favors the reading that the Gen 26:5 vocabulary indicates Abraham kept substantially the same moral content later codified at Sinai. The resolution is Moderate rather than Strong because E090 ("the law was given by Moses") is a direct statement that attributes the law's giving to Moses, requiring contextual analysis to reconcile with the pre-Sinai evidence.

---

### I-B Resolution: I5 -- Gen 26:5 Describes Only Personal Commands to Abraham

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (personal commands only): E090 (Jhn 1:17: law given by Moses), E058 (Gal 3:17, 19: law added 430 years after).
- AGAINST (comprehensive body of law): E034 (four distinct technical terms used), N008 (same terms as Sinai), E082, E084 (pre-existing "my law" and "my commandments"), E077 (adultery standard applied to Gentiles), E035 (Joseph's moral awareness).

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E090 | Contextually Clear | Direct statement, but "given by Moses" addresses the mode of formal delivery. |
| E058 | Ambiguous | Referent of "the law" is unspecified. |
| E034 | Plain | Uses four distinct terms that are the standard Sinai-law vocabulary cluster. |
| N008 | Plain | Lexical observation, verifiable. |
| E082 | Plain | "My law" -- direct divine speech. |
| E084 | Plain | "My commandments and my laws" -- direct divine speech. |
| E077 | Plain | Adultery standard applied to a Gentile by God. |
| E035 | Plain | Joseph's pre-Sinai moral awareness. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: One Contextually Clear (E090) + one Ambiguous (E058) = 2 items.
AGAINST: Five Plain items (E034, N008, E082, E084, E077, E035) = 6 items at Plain level.
The AGAINST side dominates.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements govern the Ambiguous/Contextually Clear ones. The comprehensive vocabulary of Gen 26:5 (four technical terms: mishmereth, mitsvah, chuqqah, towrah) is the standard OT vocabulary for a body of divine law, not for a few personal instructions. Reducing four distinct legal terms to "leave your country" and "circumcision" requires adding a limitation the text does not state. The Plain evidence (E034, E082, E084) shows God speaking of a pre-existing body of law.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong (against I5)**
The claim that Gen 26:5 refers only to personal commands has only Contextually Clear and Ambiguous support, while the opposing evidence is overwhelmingly Plain. The comprehensive vocabulary cluster in Gen 26:5 and God's references to "my law" and "my commandments" before Sinai are the textual facts. The claim that these are limited to personal commands lacks Plain textual support. I5 is weakly supported.

---

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases actual verse text. Checked.
- Each is the plain meaning of the words in the verse. Checked.
- E-items report what the text SAYS, not what a position infers. Checked.
- N6 was reclassified to I-A (I1) because an Abolished scholar could dispute the conclusion by arguing for imputed Adamic sin rather than operative pre-Sinai law.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- All 6 Continues E-items passed all four validation gates of Tree 3. Verified:
  - E086 (Exo 20:8-11): Subject is the Sabbath commandment; grammar is imperative; genre is legal/didactic; no harmony conflict.
  - E088 (Heb 4:4, 9): Subject is the creation sabbatismos; grammar is indicative ("remaineth"); genre is didactic epistle; no harmony conflict.
  - E037 (Rom 2:14-15): Previously verified in law-01.
  - E023 (1 Jn 3:4): Previously verified in law-01.
  - E095 (Isa 56:6-7): Subject is the Sabbath, extended to non-Israelites; grammar is conditional; genre is prophetic direct speech; no conflict.
  - E096 (Isa 66:23): Subject is Sabbath worship by "all flesh"; grammar is future indicative; genre is prophetic direct speech; no conflict.
- All 35 Neutral E-items were classified Neutral because they report factual observations (pre-Sinai moral vocabulary, pre-Sinai judgment, pre-Sinai law references) that both sides must accept, without using continuation or cessation vocabulary. Verified.
- No E-item is classified Abolished because no verse in this study uses cessation vocabulary applied to the pre-Sinai moral law.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- N006: Clean/unclean distinction pre-dates Leviticus -- unavoidable from E8, E9. Verified.
- N007: God held people accountable for moral acts before Sinai -- unavoidable from E5, E6, E14, E15. Verified.
- N008: Same Hebrew terms in Gen 26:5 and Sinai legislation -- unavoidable lexical observation. Verified.
- N009: God speaks of "my law" and "my commandments" before Sinai -- unavoidable from E22, E24. Verified.
- N010: Fourth commandment grounds itself in creation -- unavoidable from E26, E1. Verified.
- N6: Reclassified to I-A (I1/I009) because the conclusion that "a law was operative from Adam to Moses" could be disputed by an Abolished scholar. Verified.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
- I1/I009 (I-A): Components (E036, E089) all in E table. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A.
- I2/I003 (I-A): Components (E034, E035, E036, E064, E066, E082, E084) all in E table. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A.
- I3/I010 (I-A): Components (E063, E086, E083, E087, E088, N010) all in E/N tables. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A.
- I4/I011 (I-B): Both sides have E/N items. Confirmed I-B.
- I5/I012 (I-B): Both sides have E/N items. Confirmed I-B.
- I6/I004 (I-A): Components (E065, E067, E068, E076, E077, E037) all in E table. Text-derived. Confirmed I-A.
- I7/I013 (I-D): Overrides E034, E066, E082, E084, E077, E093. Confirmed I-D.
- I8/I014 (I-A): Components (E034, E082, E084, E081, N008, N010, E036) all in E/N tables. Text-derived. However, the word "codification" is not in the text. The term is an interpretive label for a textual pattern. Components are text-derived; the label "codification" is added. This involves criterion #1 (adding a concept). Reclassify? The claim uses all textual data but adds the label "codification." This is #5 (systematizing) + minor #1. Since #1 is present, check I-A consistency: I-A should only require #5 (and optionally #4a). #1 is present. -> Reclassify as I-B? No -- there are no E/N items on the AGAINST side that say the Sinai legislation was entirely new content. The only AGAINST evidence (E090, E058) is about the timing of formal delivery, not about content novelty. Since there is no E/N support for the claim "all Sinai content was new," this is not I-B (which requires E/N on both sides). It remains I-A with the notation that "codification" is an added label. Confirmed I-A with caveat.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
- I1/I009: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I2/I003: Same. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I3/I010: Same. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I4/I011: Requires determining whether the vocabulary overlap = content identity. This involves choosing between readings. Confirmed conflicts on at least one reading (I-B).
- I5/I012: Requires limiting four legal terms to personal commands. This requires E034 to have a narrower meaning than its vocabulary suggests. Confirmed conflicts (I-B).
- I6/I004: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. Confirmed aligns (I-A).
- I7/I013: Requires E034, E066, E082, E084, E077 to not presuppose a knowable standard. Confirmed conflicts (I-D).
- I8/I014: Does not require E/N to mean other than lexical value (aside from the "codification" label). Confirmed aligns (I-A).

**Step E: Run consistency checks.**
- I1/I009 (I-A): Requires #5 only. Confirmed.
- I2/I003 (I-A): Requires #5 only. Confirmed.
- I3/I010 (I-A): Requires #5 only. Confirmed.
- I4/I011 (I-B): E/N items on both sides. Confirmed.
- I5/I012 (I-B): E/N items on both sides. Confirmed.
- I6/I004 (I-A): Requires #5 only. Confirmed.
- I7/I013 (I-D): Overrides E034, E066, E082, E084, E077, E093. Confirmed.
- I8/I014 (I-A): Requires #5 + minor #1. Noted.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- I4/I011: The SIS resolution is documented in full above. Confirmed.
- I5/I012: The SIS resolution is documented in full above. Confirmed.

### What CAN Be Said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies)

1. God performed three actions on the seventh day at creation: rested (shabath), blessed, and sanctified it (E063 / Gen 2:2-3).
2. The fourth commandment explicitly grounds itself in the creation event with the word "wherefore" (E086 / Exo 20:8-11; N010).
3. God issued the first prohibition with a stated penalty before Sinai: "thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (E064 / Gen 2:16-17).
4. The word "sin" (chattath) appears before Sinai, when God warns Cain: "sin lieth at the door" (E066 / Gen 4:7).
5. God judged murder (Cain), universal wickedness (flood), and sexual immorality (Sodom) before Sinai (E067, E068, E076 / Gen 4, 6-7, 19).
6. God held non-Israelites (Cain, pre-flood humanity, Sodom, Abimelech) accountable for moral acts before Sinai (N007).
7. The clean/unclean animal distinction existed before the Levitical codification, since Noah knew to differentiate clean and unclean animals (E070 / Gen 7:2; N006).
8. God testified that Abraham "kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws" using the same Hebrew terms as the Sinai legislation (E034 / Gen 26:5; N008).
9. Joseph called adultery "sin against God" before Sinai. God called Abimelech's potential adultery "sinning against me" (E035 / Gen 39:9; E077 / Gen 20:6).
10. God spoke of "my law" and "my commandments" as already existing before the Sinai event (E082 / Exo 16:4; E084 / Exo 16:28; N009).
11. The Sabbath institution was invoked and tested before Sinai (E083 / Exo 16:23; E085 / Exo 16:29).
12. Paul states "sin is not imputed when there is no law" and "death reigned from Adam to Moses" (E036 / Rom 5:13-14).
13. Paul states "where no law is, there is no transgression" (E089 / Rom 4:15).
14. Gentiles have "the work of the law written in their hearts" (E037 / Rom 2:14-15).
15. John defines sin as "the transgression of the law" and cites Cain as an example of evil (E023 / 1 Jn 3:4; E091 / 1 Jn 3:12).
16. Peter calls the pre-Sinai Sodomites' deeds "unlawful" (athesmos) (E093 / 2 Pe 2:8).
17. The author of Hebrews states "there remaineth a sabbatismos to the people of God," traced to creation (E088 / Heb 4:4, 9).

### What CANNOT Be Said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture)

1. Scripture does not contain an explicit command to humans to observe the seventh day in Genesis 2:2-3. The text describes God's actions (resting, blessing, sanctifying) but does not record a command to Adam to keep the Sabbath. The command first appears in Exodus 16 and formally in Exodus 20:8-11.
2. Scripture does not explicitly identify which specific "commandments, statutes, and laws" Abraham kept (Gen 26:5). The terms are comprehensive Sinai-law vocabulary, but the content is not enumerated.
3. Scripture does not explicitly state whether the vocabulary in Gen 26:5 indicates the same content as the Decalogue or the narrator's use of later terminology. Both readings are possible (I4, I5).
4. Scripture does not explicitly state that the moral law was a formally codified body of law from Adam onward. The evidence shows moral principles, accountability, and law vocabulary operating before Sinai, but the text does not describe a pre-Sinai written code.
5. Scripture does not explicitly reconcile "the law was given by Moses" (Jhn 1:17) with God's reference to "my commandments and my laws" before Sinai (Exo 16:28). The reconciliation (formal giving vs. prior existence) is an inference.
6. Scripture does not explicitly state whether "the law" in Galatians 3:17, 19 refers to the moral law, the ceremonial system, or the entire Sinai legislation. The referent is unspecified. *(Examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Galatians 3.)*
7. Neither position can claim the text explicitly states its complete systematic framework. The Continues position systematizes the pre-Sinai evidence into a doctrine of pre-existent moral law (I-A inferences). The Abolished position's claim that no moral law existed before Sinai (I7) requires overriding multiple explicit statements.

---

## Analysis

### The Six Lines of Pre-Sinai Evidence

This study investigated six specific categories of evidence for moral law operating before Sinai, plus additional supporting evidence discovered by tools.

**1. The Sabbath at Creation (Gen 2:2-3)**

Genesis 2:2-3 records three divine actions on the seventh day: God rested (shabath), blessed, and sanctified it. The verb shabath (H7673) is the root of the noun shabbath (H7676). The fourth commandment (Exo 20:8-11) explicitly connects itself to creation with the causal conjunction "for" (ki) and the conclusion "wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it." The commandment says "Remember" -- presupposing prior knowledge. Jesus states the Sabbath "was made for man" (anthropos -- generic humanity, Mrk 2:27). Hebrews 4:4, 9 traces a continuing sabbatismos from creation. The manna-Sabbath test (Exo 16:23-29) invokes the Sabbath institution before Sinai.

The text of Genesis 2:2-3 does not contain an explicit command to humans. The Sabbath command first appears in Exodus 16 (pre-Sinai) and formally in Exodus 20. The fourth commandment itself bridges this by explicitly rooting the command in the creation event.

**2. Cain's Murder and God's Response (Gen 4:3-15)**

God warns Cain about "sin" (chattath, v.7) before the act. After the murder, God investigates, pronounces a curse, and enforces a penalty. The word "sin" appears before Sinai. Cain acknowledges the justice of the punishment (v.13) and fears others will kill him (v.14) -- implying a recognized standard. The Noahic prohibition (Gen 9:5-6) formalizes the murder prohibition for all humanity, grounded in the image of God -- a creation-based rationale.

John defines sin as "the transgression of the law" (1 Jn 3:4) and then cites Cain (3:12) as an example of evil. This connection places Cain's murder within the framework of law-transgression.

**3. Clean and Unclean Animals (Gen 7:2)**

God instructs Noah to differentiate between "clean" (tahowr, H2889) and "not clean" animals (Gen 7:2). This is the earliest biblical occurrence of tahowr -- the same word used throughout Leviticus 11 for the dietary laws. Noah sacrifices clean animals after the flood (Gen 8:20), and God accepts the offering. The clean/unclean distinction was operative in both daily life (ark loading) and worship (sacrifice) before its Levitical codification.

**4. Abraham Keeping God's Laws (Gen 26:5)**

God testifies that Abraham "kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws" (Gen 26:5). The four terms (mishmereth, mitsvah, chuqqah, towrah) are the standard vocabulary cluster for the Sinai legislation (cf. Deu 11:1; 1 Ki 2:3; 2 Ki 17:13). Cross-testament parallels confirm: Deu 30:10 (score 0.496), Deu 28:15 (0.487), 1 Ki 2:3 (0.484) use the same vocabulary cluster.

The text does not enumerate which commandments Abraham kept. Whether the vocabulary indicates the same content as the Sinai legislation or reflects the narrator's use of later terminology is debated (I-B items I4 and I5, with I4 resolved Moderate toward Continues and I5 resolved Strong against the Abolished reading).

God also testifies that Abraham will "command his children...to keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment" (Gen 18:19). Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek (Gen 14:20) -- a pre-Sinai worship act.

**5. Joseph Recognizing Adultery as Sin (Gen 39:9)**

Joseph calls adultery "this great wickedness, and sin against God" (Gen 39:9). He identifies it as sin against God, not merely a social offense. The same language appears in Gen 20:6, where God tells Abimelech (a Gentile) that taking another man's wife is "sinning against me." Abimelech the Philistine enforces a death penalty for adultery (Gen 26:11). Judah orders execution for sexual immorality (Gen 38:24).

The adultery prohibition is recognized and enforced by both Israelites (Joseph, Judah) and non-Israelites (Abimelech) before Sinai.

**6. The Manna-Sabbath Test Before Sinai (Exo 16:4-30)**

God tests Israel on "my law" (towrah, Exo 16:4) and "my commandments and my laws" (mitsvah + towrah, Exo 16:28) before the Sinai event (Exo 19-20). The Sabbath is invoked (Exo 16:23 -- first narrative use of the noun shabbath) and tested. God rebukes Israel for violating commandments that are spoken of as pre-existing. The manna test provides a chronological marker: the Sabbath is operative between creation and Sinai.

At Marah (Exo 15:25-26), God "made for them a statute and an ordinance" and referenced "his commandments" and "his statutes" -- all before reaching Sinai.

### The Abolished Position's Counter-Evidence

Two passages are cited by the Abolished position:

**John 1:17:** "The law was given by Moses." This states Moses as the agent of formal delivery. It does not state the moral content originated with Moses. Gen 26:5 uses towrah ("law") for what Abraham kept before Moses. The text can be read as: formal codification through Moses, while moral content pre-existed.

**Galatians 3:17, 19:** "The law...was 430 years after [Abraham]...It was added because of transgressions." The referent of "the law" is unspecified (the text does not say "the moral law" or "the ceremonial law"). "Added because of transgressions" presupposes transgressions existed before the addition -- which implies a prior standard. *(Examined in depth in a later law-XX study on Galatians 3.)*

The I-D inference (I7) -- that no moral law existed before Sinai and God judged by sovereign will without a knowable standard -- requires overriding God's own testimony that Abraham kept "my commandments, my statutes, and my laws" (E034), God's pre-Sinai references to "my law" and "my commandments" (E082, E084), God's warning to Cain about "sin" (E066), God's statement to Abimelech that adultery is "sinning against me" (E077), and Peter's description of Sodomite acts as "unlawful" (E093).

### The Logical Framework: Romans 5:12-14 and 1 John 3:4

Paul's argument in Romans 5:12-14 provides the logical structure: if sin is not imputed without law (5:13), and death (the penalty for sin) reigned from Adam to Moses (5:14), then a law was operative during this period. John's definition -- "sin is the transgression of the law" (1 Jn 3:4) -- combined with his citation of Cain (3:12) as an example of evil, extends this logic: if sin = law-transgression, and Cain sinned, then the law was operative for Cain. The pre-Sinai Genesis narratives provide the specific instances that fill this logical framework.

## Conclusion

This study examined 41 unique explicit statements, 5 necessary implications, and 8 inferences. 35 explicit statements are Neutral -- factual observations both sides must accept (pre-Sinai moral vocabulary, pre-Sinai divine judgment, pre-Sinai law references, pre-Sinai Sabbath invocation). 6 explicit statements use law-continuation vocabulary (the fourth commandment's creation basis, Hebrews' sabbatismos, Romans 2:14-15's law written on hearts, 1 John 3:4's definition of sin, Isaiah's universal Sabbath prophecies). Zero explicit statements use cessation vocabulary applied to the pre-Sinai moral law.

5 I-A inferences systematize the pre-Sinai evidence into doctrinal positions supporting the Continues position. 2 I-B inferences address the Gen 26:5 vocabulary question (I4 resolved Moderate toward Continues; I5 resolved Strong against the Abolished reading). 1 I-D inference (no moral law before Sinai, only sovereign divine will) requires overriding multiple explicit statements (E034, E066, E077, E082, E084, E093).

The study's question -- "If the moral law only began at Sinai, how were these pre-Sinai acts recognized as sin or obedience?" -- finds the following textual data: sin is named before Sinai (Gen 4:7), accountability is enforced before Sinai (Gen 3-4, 6-7, 18-19, 20), the clean/unclean distinction operates before Sinai (Gen 7:2), Sinai-law vocabulary is used for Abraham's obedience before Sinai (Gen 26:5), adultery is called "sin against God" before Sinai (Gen 39:9; 20:6), and God speaks of "my law" and "my commandments" before reaching Sinai (Exo 16:4, 28). Paul's argument (Rom 5:12-14) provides the logical principle, and John's definition (1 Jn 3:4) with his citation of Cain (3:12) provides the definitional link.
