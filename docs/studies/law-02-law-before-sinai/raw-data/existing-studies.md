### Question
What is God's moral law? What is its basis, nature, and scope? Investigate the Decalogue's unique origin (God's voice, God's finger, stone, inside the Ark), its attributes that mirror God's character (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal), and its universal/eternal scope.

### Summary Answer
The Bible presents the Decalogue (Ten Commandments) as a distinct category of law, distinguished from all other legislation by seven unique markers: spoken by God's own voice, written by God's own finger, engraved on stone, placed inside the ark, completed with "he added no more," called "the covenant," and called "the testimony." The attributes the Bible ascribes to this law (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal) are the same attributes ascribed to God Himself. The law's scope extends before Sinai (Genesis 26:5; Romans 5:12-14), beyond Israel (Romans 2:14-15), into the new covenant (Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:10), and to the end of time (Revelation 12:17; 14:12; 22:14).

### Key Evidence Items Relevant to law-02

**E34** (Gen 26:5): Abraham "obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws" -- classified NEUTRAL (factual observation of pre-Sinai obedience). Same vocabulary (mishmereth, mitsvah, chuqqah, towrah) as Sinai legislation.

**E35** (Gen 39:9): Joseph called adultery "this great wickedness, and sin against God" -- classified NEUTRAL (factual observation of pre-Sinai moral awareness).

**E36** (Rom 5:12-14): "By one man sin entered into the world...death reigned from Adam to Moses" -- classified NEUTRAL (factual observation that sin/death existed before Sinai).

**E37** (Rom 2:14-15): Gentiles "do by nature the things contained in the law...which shew the work of the law written in their hearts" -- classified CONTINUES (implies moral law beyond Israel).

**I3**: "The Bible teaches that the moral law existed before its formal promulgation at Sinai and is therefore not limited to the Mosaic era" -- classified I-A (Evidence-Extending), systematizing E34, E35, E36. **This study (law-02) is the dedicated investigation of that inference.**

**I4**: "The Bible teaches that the moral law is universal, binding on all humans, not just Israel" -- classified I-A, systematizing E37, E23, E45, E36.

### Evidence Tally
- 62 E-items, 5 N-items (after N5 reclassification), 8 I-items
- E-items: 35 Continues, 0 Abolished, 27 Neutral
- I-items: 5 I-A (Continues), 1 I-B (Moderate toward Continues), 1 I-C (Neutral), 1 I-D (Abolished)
- I-B Resolution (I6): Cessation passages refer to ceremonial ordinances (dogma) -- resolved Moderate toward Continues

### Significance for law-02
The law-01 study identified I3 as an inference that the moral law pre-existed Sinai, based on three E-items (E34, E35, E36). It classified I3 as I-A (Evidence-Extending) because it systematizes explicit statements. The present study (law-02) is the dedicated, thorough investigation of that pre-Sinai evidence, examining all Genesis-to-Exodus 16 passages where moral law concepts appear before the Sinai legislation of Exodus 19-20.
