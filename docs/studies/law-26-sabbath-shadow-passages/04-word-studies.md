## Greek Words

### sabbaton (G4521) -- "Sabbath"
**Original:** sabbaton
**Transliteration:** sab'-bat-on
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**Occurrences:** 68 (BLB count); 55 unique KJV translation instances
**Definition:** Of Hebrew origin (H7676); the Sabbath (i.e. Shabbath), or day of weekly repose

**Translations in KJV:**
| Count | Percentage | Translation |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 19 | 34.5% | sabbath |
| 13 | 23.6% | sabbath day |
| 7 | 12.7% | sabbath days |
| 4 | 7.3% | of the week |
| 3 | 5.5% | the sabbath day |
| 3 | 5.5% | week |
| 2 | 3.6% | of the sabbath |
| 1 | 1.8% | when the sabbath day |
| 1 | 1.8% | on the sabbath |
| 1 | 1.8% | the sabbath |
| 1 | 1.8% | a sabbath |

**Key Verse Usage:** Col 2:16 uses sabbaton in the Genitive Plural Neuter form (sabbaton, GPN). The genitive plural is also used in several weekly Sabbath contexts (e.g., Mat 12:1, Luk 4:16, Acts 13:14), so the plural form alone does not determine whether the referent is weekly or ceremonial sabbaths. The context must decide.

**Semantic Range:** sabbaton can mean: (1) the weekly seventh-day Sabbath, (2) a sabbath rest day of any kind, (3) a week (period of seven days). All three senses appear in the NT. The referent in Col 2:16 must be determined by context, not by the word alone.

### sabbatismos (G4520) -- "Sabbath-keeping"
**Original:** sabbatismos
**Transliteration:** sab-bat-is-mos'
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 1 (hapax legomenon)
**Definition:** From a derivative of [G4521](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4521/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; a "sabbatism," i.e. the repose of Christianity (as a type of future rest)

**Key Usage:** Heb 4:9 only. The -ismos suffix denotes practice/observance (cf. baptismos = practice of baptizing). The author switches from katapausis (rest, used 8 times in Heb 3-4) to sabbatismos in v.9 only, indicating a deliberate word choice. The verb apoleipetai (Present Passive Indicative) = "is currently remaining/left behind."

---

### skia (G4639) -- "Shadow"
**Original:** skia
**Transliteration:** skee'-ah
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 7
**Definition:** Apparently a primary word; "shade" or a shadow (literally or figuratively)

**All NT Theological Uses:**
1. **Col 2:17** -- "Which are a shadow [skia] of things to come [ton mellonton]; but the body [soma] is of Christ." Applied to the heorte/neomenia/sabbaton triad.
2. **Heb 8:5** -- "Who serve unto the example and shadow [skia] of heavenly things." Applied to the earthly priestly service/tabernacle.
3. **Heb 10:1** -- "For the law having a shadow [skia] of good things to come." Applied to "those sacrifices which they offered year by year."

**Distribution Pattern:** In all three theological uses, skia is applied to the ceremonial/sacrificial system. It is never applied to the Decalogue or the moral law. The other 4 uses (Mat 4:16; Mrk 4:32; Luk 1:79; Acts 5:15) are literal physical shadows.

---

### cheirographon (G5498) -- "Handwriting"
**Original:** cheirographon
**Transliteration:** khi-rog'-raf-on
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**Occurrences:** 1 (hapax legomenon)
**Definition:** Compound of cheir (G5495, "hand") + grapho (G1125, "write") = "something hand-written"

**Key Usage:** Col 2:14 only. The Accusative Singular Neuter (ASN) matches the neuter article to (ASN). The relative pronoun ho (NSN, Nom Sg Neuter) in "which was against us" agrees with cheirographon (neuter), confirming the referent. The Decalogue was "written with the finger of God" (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10). The book of the law was written by Moses' hand (Deu 31:24). Cheirographon = hand-written, aligning with Moses' writing, not God's.

---

### dogma (G1378) -- "Decree/Ordinance"
**Original:** dogma
**Transliteration:** dog'-mah
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**Occurrences:** 5
**Definition:** From the base of [G1380](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1380/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dokeo); a law (civil, ceremonial, or ecclesiastical)

**All 5 NT Occurrences:**
1. **Luk 2:1** -- "a decree [dogma] from Caesar Augustus" (civil/imperial)
2. **Acts 16:4** -- "the decrees [dogmata] ordained of the apostles and elders" (ecclesiastical)
3. **Acts 17:7** -- "the decrees [dogmata] of Caesar" (civil/imperial)
4. **Eph 2:15** -- "the law of commandments contained in ordinances [en dogmasin]" (what was abolished)
5. **Col 2:14** -- "the handwriting of ordinances [tois dogmasin]" (what was nailed to the cross)

**Distribution Pattern:** Dogma is used for (a) civil decrees of Caesar, (b) ecclesiastical decisions of the Jerusalem Council, and (c) the ordinances nailed/abolished in the two primary cessation texts. It is NEVER used for the Decalogue or the moral law. Parsing in Col 2:14: tois dogmasin = Dative Plural Neuter.

---

### dogmatizo (G1379) -- "Subject to ordinances"
**Original:** dogmatizo
**Transliteration:** dog-mat-id'-zo
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Occurrences:** 1 (hapax legomenon in NT)
**Definition:** From [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dogma); to prescribe by statute, i.e. (reflexively) to submit to ceremonial rules

**Key Usage:** Col 2:20 only -- "Why...are ye subject to ordinances [dogmatizesthe]?" The verbal form of dogma. Paul uses the same root (dogma in v.14, dogmatizo in v.20) to link what was nailed to the cross with the ordinances the Colossians are submitting to.

---

### noumenia (G3561) -- "New moon"
**Original:** noumenia
**Transliteration:** noo-may-nee'-ah
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 1 (NT hapax legomenon)
**Definition:** Feminine of a compound of neos (new) + men (month); the festival of new moon

**Key Usage:** Col 2:16 only. Genitive Singular Feminine (neomenias, GSF). The Greek transliteration of the Hebrew chodesh (H2320) new-moon festival concept. Appears in the triad: heortes (Gen Sg F) + neomenias (Gen Sg F) + sabbaton (Gen Pl N).

---

### heorte (G1859) -- "Feast/Festival"
**Original:** heorte
**Transliteration:** heh-or-tay'
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 27
**Definition:** Of uncertain affinity; a festival: feast, holyday

**Key Usage:** Col 2:16 uses the Genitive Singular Feminine (heortes). The word is used throughout the NT for Jewish feasts (Passover: Jhn 2:23; 6:4; Tabernacles: Jhn 7:2,8,10; unspecified: Jhn 5:1; Acts 18:21). It always refers to the annual Jewish festival calendar.

---

### diakrisis (G1253) -- "Discerning/Disputation"
**Original:** diakrisis
**Transliteration:** dee-ak'-ree-sis
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 3
**Definition:** From [G1252](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1252/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; judicial estimation: discerning, disputation

**All 3 NT Occurrences:**
1. **Rom 14:1** -- "not to doubtful disputations [diakriseis dialogismon]"
2. **1 Cor 12:10** -- "discerning [diakrisis] of spirits"
3. **Heb 5:14** -- "senses exercised to discern [diakrisin] both good and evil"

**Key Context:** In Rom 14:1, diakrisis + dialogismos = "disputes about opinions/reasonings." This sets the genre for the entire chapter: these are matters of personal conviction, not settled doctrine.

---

### soma (G4983) -- "Body"
**Original:** soma
**Transliteration:** so'-mah
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**Occurrences:** 146
**Definition:** The body (as a sound whole), used in a very wide application

**Key Usage in Col 2:17:** "the body [soma] is of Christ." The shadow/body (skia/soma) contrast: the shadow is cast by the body (substance). The body/substance that casts the ceremonial shadow is Christ. The soma = the reality to which the skia points.

---

### exaleipho (G1813) -- "To blot out"
**Original:** exaleipho
**Transliteration:** ex-al-i'-fo
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Occurrences:** 5
**Definition:** From ek (G1537) and aleipho (G218); to smear out, i.e. obliterate (erase tears, figuratively pardon sin)

**Key Usage in Col 2:14:** exaleipsas = Aorist Active Participle, Nominative Singular Masculine (AAP-NSM). The action is completed (Aorist) -- "having blotted out." The participle is circumstantial, indicating the means by which the cheirographon was removed.

**Other Occurrences:** Acts 3:19 ("that your sins may be blotted out"); Rev 3:5 ("I will not blot out his name"); Rev 7:17, 21:4 ("God shall wipe away all tears").

---

### proseloo (G4338) -- "To nail to"
**Original:** proseloo
**Transliteration:** pros-ay-lo'-o
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Occurrences:** 1 (hapax legomenon)
**Definition:** From pros (G4314) and a derivative of helos (nail); to peg to, i.e. spike fast: nail to

**Key Usage:** Col 2:14 only -- proselosas = Aorist Active Participle, Nominative Singular Masculine (AAP-NSM). "Having nailed it to his cross." The object nailed is auto (Accusative Singular Neuter), referring back to the neuter cheirographon.

## Hebrew Words

### shabbath (H7676) -- "Sabbath"
**Original:** shabbath
**Transliteration:** shab-bawth'
**Part of Speech:** Masculine/feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 108
**Definition:** Intensive from [H7673](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7673/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (shabath); intermission, i.e. (specifically) the Sabbath: (every) sabbath

**Usage Notes:** Used for both the weekly Sabbath (Exo 20:8,10,11; Lev 23:3) and in the ceremonial triad "feasts/new moons/sabbaths" (2 Chr 31:3; Eze 45:17; 1 Chr 23:31). The context determines whether weekly or ceremonial sabbaths are in view. In Lev 23:38, "shabbetot YHWH" (sabbaths of the LORD) is explicitly separated from the feasts by millibad.

---

### shabbathown (H7677) -- "Sabbatism/Rest"
**Original:** shabbathown
**Transliteration:** shab-baw-thone'
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 11
**Definition:** From [H7676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7676/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; a sabbatism or special holiday: rest, sabbath

**Usage Distribution:**
- Weekly Sabbath: Lev 23:3 (shabbath shabbathown -- "sabbath of rest")
- Day of Atonement: Lev 16:31; 23:32 (shabbath shabbathown)
- Feast of Trumpets: Lev 23:24 (shabbathown alone -- no shabbath prefix)
- Feast of Tabernacles: Lev 23:39 (shabbathown alone -- no shabbath prefix)
- Sabbatical Year: Lev 25:4,5 (shabbath shabbathown)

**Vocabulary Pattern:** The full form shabbath shabbathown is used for the weekly Sabbath, the Day of Atonement, and the Sabbatical Year. The simple form shabbathown alone (without shabbath) is used for the first and eighth days of Tabernacles and the Feast of Trumpets.

---

### moed (H4150) -- "Appointed time/feast"
**Original:** moed
**Transliteration:** mo-ade'
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 223
**Definition:** An appointment, i.e. a fixed time or season; specifically a festival; conventionally a year; by implication an assembly; the place of meeting; also a signal

**Key Usage:** Lev 23:2,4,37,44 for the annual feasts. The weekly Sabbath is NEVER called moed in Lev 23 or elsewhere. Eze 45:17 uses moed: "in all solemnities [moadei] of the house of Israel." Gen 1:14 connects moadim to the celestial luminaries ("for signs and for seasons [moadim]").

---

### chag (H2282) -- "Feast/Festival"
**Original:** chag
**Transliteration:** khag
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 62
**Definition:** A festival, or a victim therefor: (solemn) feast (day), sacrifice, solemnity

**Key Usage:** Used for the three pilgrimage feasts (Exo 23:14-17): Unleavened Bread (Lev 23:6), Tabernacles (Lev 23:34,39,41). Eze 45:17 uses chag: "in the feasts [chaggim]." The weekly Sabbath is NEVER called chag.

---

### bad/millibad (H905) -- "Apart from/Beside"
**Original:** bad
**Transliteration:** bad
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun (used prepositionally)
**Occurrences:** 56
**Definition:** Properly separation; as an adverb, apart, only, besides

**Key Usage in Lev 23:38:** millibad (min + le + bad = "from-to-separation" = "apart from/beside"). The fourfold repetition in Lev 23:38 -- "millibad the sabbaths of the LORD, and millibad your gifts, and millibad all your vows, and millibad all your freewill offerings" -- grammatically separates the weekly sabbaths from the feast offerings summarized in v.37. Also in Num 29:39: "beside [millibad] your vows and your freewill offerings."

---

### zakar (H2142) -- "Remember"
**Original:** zakar
**Transliteration:** zaw-kar'
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Occurrences:** 233
**Definition:** A primitive root; to mark (so as to be recognized), i.e. to remember; by implication to mention; to be male

**Key Usage in Exo 20:8:** "Remember [zakar] the sabbath day, to keep it holy." The Infinitive Absolute form = the most emphatic command form in Hebrew. Zakar is the quintessential MEMORIAL verb, always pointing BACKWARD to a completed past event:
- Exo 13:3 -- "Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt"
- Deu 5:15 -- "Remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt"
- Deu 8:2 -- "thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee"

The zakar/skia directional contrast: zakar points backward to creation; skia points forward to Christ's coming. These are opposite temporal directions. The Sabbath is a zakar-institution (memorial), not a skia-institution (shadow).

---

### chodesh (H2320) -- "New moon/Month"
**Original:** chodesh
**Transliteration:** kho'-desh
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 276
**Definition:** From [H2318](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2318/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (chadash); the new moon; by implication a month

**Key Usage:** Appears in the ceremonial triad with feasts and sabbaths: 1 Chr 23:31, 2 Chr 31:3, Eze 45:17, Hos 2:11, Isa 1:13. Col 2:16 uses the Greek equivalent noumenia (G3561). Isa 66:23 uses chodesh alongside shabbath for new-earth worship.
