# Do Colossians 2:16-17 and Romans 14:5 Abolish the Weekly Sabbath?

**A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence**

---

Three New Testament passages are commonly cited as proof that the weekly Sabbath was abolished at the cross: Colossians 2:16-17, Romans 14:5, and Galatians 4:9-10. These verses are central to the debate over whether the Fourth Commandment remains binding for Christians. This study examines each passage on its own terms, looking at the actual words used, the surrounding context, and the Old Testament background that Paul's original readers would have understood.

## What Was Nailed to the Cross?

The argument begins with Colossians 2:14:

> "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross." (Colossians 2:14)

The phrase "handwriting of ordinances" translates two Greek words: *cheirographon* and *dogmasin*. The word *cheirographon* literally means "hand-written" -- it is a compound of *cheir* (hand) and *grapho* (to write). This is significant because the Ten Commandments were not hand-written by a human being. Scripture is explicit about their authorship:

> "And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God." (Exodus 31:18)

The Decalogue was written by the finger of God. The book of the ceremonial law, by contrast, was written by Moses' hand (Deuteronomy 31:9, 24). A "hand-written document" and a God-written document are not the same thing. The very word Paul chose -- *cheirographon* -- points away from the Ten Commandments.

The second word, *dogma* (ordinance/decree), appears five times in the New Testament. It is used for Caesar's civil decrees, the Jerusalem Council's decisions, and the ordinances abolished in Ephesians 2:15 and Colossians 2:14. It is never once used for the Decalogue or the moral law.

Paul himself confirms what he means by these "ordinances" later in the same chapter:

> "Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, (Touch not; taste not; handle not; Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?" (Colossians 2:20-22)

He identifies the ordinances as regulations about touching, tasting, and handling -- things that "perish with the using" -- and calls them "commandments and doctrines of men." This description does not fit the Ten Commandments, which are the commandments of God.

## The Feast, New Moon, and Sabbath Triad

Colossians 2:16-17 then says:

> "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ." (Colossians 2:16-17)

The word "therefore" connects these items back to what was nailed to the cross in verse 14. Paul lists five things: meat offerings, drink offerings, holydays (feasts), new moons, and sabbath days. This combination -- feast, new moon, sabbath -- is not something Paul invented. It is a well-known triad that appears repeatedly throughout the Old Testament in ceremonial contexts:

> "And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel." (Ezekiel 45:17)

Ezekiel 45:17 is particularly striking. It uses the same categories as Colossians 2:16, in the same order -- meat offerings, drink offerings, feasts, new moons, sabbaths -- and it specifies that these are for the purpose of ceremonial reconciliation (atonement). This same triad appears in 2 Chronicles 31:3, 1 Chronicles 23:31, 2 Chronicles 2:4, 2 Chronicles 8:13, Hosea 2:11, Nehemiah 10:33, and Isaiah 1:13-14. In every single occurrence, this triad describes the ceremonial calendar system.

## Shadows and Memorials Point in Opposite Directions

Colossians 2:17 calls these items "a shadow of things to come." The Greek word *skia* (shadow) appears in three theological contexts in the New Testament. Every time, it refers to the ceremonial system:

In Colossians 2:17, it describes the feast/new moon/sabbath triad. In Hebrews 8:5, it describes the earthly sanctuary service. And in Hebrews 10:1:

> "For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect." (Hebrews 10:1)

The word *skia* is applied to annual sacrifices, the tabernacle service, and the ceremonial calendar. It is never applied to the Decalogue or the moral law in any passage.

There is a deeper issue here as well. A shadow points forward -- it is a preview of something yet to come. But the weekly Sabbath points backward. The Fourth Commandment explicitly says:

> "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work... For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it." (Exodus 20:8-11)

The command uses the word "remember" (*zakar*), a memorial term that points backward to creation. A memorial and a shadow face in opposite temporal directions. The weekly Sabbath is a *zakar*-institution (remembering the past), not a *skia*-institution (foreshadowing the future). Calling the weekly Sabbath a "shadow of things to come" contradicts its own stated purpose.

## The Old Testament Already Distinguishes Weekly Sabbaths from Feast Sabbaths

This is not a distinction invented by later interpreters. The Bible itself draws the line. Leviticus 23 lists all of Israel's annual feasts, and then says:

> "These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day: Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD." (Leviticus 23:37-38)

The word "beside" (*millibad* in Hebrew) means "apart from" or "in addition to." It is repeated four times for emphasis. The annual feasts are one category. The "sabbaths of the LORD" -- the weekly Sabbaths -- are a separate category. The text goes out of its way to keep them apart.

The annual feast system also included its own sabbath days -- rest days built into the feasts themselves (such as the first and last days of the Feast of Tabernacles). These ceremonial sabbaths are part of the feast system. The weekly Sabbath is not.

## Romans 14:5 Does Not Name the Sabbath

> "One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind." (Romans 14:5)

This verse is often cited as evidence that the Sabbath is a matter of personal choice. But the word "Sabbath" (*sabbaton*) does not appear anywhere in Romans 14. The text uses the generic word *hemera* ("day") without specifying which day is in view.

More importantly, Romans 14:1 sets the context for the entire chapter:

> "Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations." (Romans 14:1)

Paul classifies the subject matter of Romans 14 as "doubtful disputations" -- matters of personal opinion and conscience, not settled doctrine. The chapter deals with questions about eating meat versus vegetables and observing certain days. These are the kinds of issues early Christians disagreed about as Jewish and Gentile believers navigated their differences.

Would Paul classify a commandment from the Decalogue -- one of the Ten Commandments written by the finger of God -- as a "doubtful disputation"? His own words in the same letter say otherwise:

> "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." (Romans 3:31)

> "I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet... the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." (Romans 7:7, 12)

In the very same epistle, Paul identifies the law as the Decalogue (by quoting the Tenth Commandment), calls it holy, just, good, and spiritual, and emphatically denies making it void. It is inconsistent to suppose that Paul would, in the same letter, reduce a Decalogue commandment to a matter of indifferent personal preference.

## Galatians 4:10 Does Not Name the Sabbath Either

> "How turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years." (Galatians 4:9-10)

As with Romans 14:5, the word *sabbaton* does not appear in this passage. Paul says "days" (*hemeras*) -- a generic term. The accompanying items -- "months, times, and years" -- correspond naturally to new moons, feast seasons, and sabbatical or jubilee years, all of which are ceremonial calendar observances.

The context of Galatians makes the subject clear. The controversy in Galatia was about circumcision:

> "Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing." (Galatians 5:2)

Paul is addressing Gentile believers who were being pressured to adopt the ceremonial system -- circumcision and the entire calendar that went with it. He is not discussing the Ten Commandments. In fact, Paul himself elsewhere distinguishes the two categories:

> "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God." (1 Corinthians 7:19)

Circumcision (ceremony) is "nothing." The commandments of God are everything. Paul clearly recognized that these are different categories.

## A Sabbath Rest Remains

The book of Hebrews adds one more piece to the picture:

> "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God." (Hebrews 4:9)

The word translated "rest" is *sabbatismos* -- a word that appears only here in the entire New Testament. The *-ismos* suffix in Greek denotes the practice or observance of something. *Sabbatismos* means "Sabbath-keeping" or "Sabbath-observance." The verb "remaineth" (*apoleipetai*) is in the present tense: a Sabbath-keeping *is currently remaining* for the people of God.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

Honest study requires acknowledging what the text does not explicitly state:

- **Colossians 2:16 does not explicitly say "ceremonial sabbaths only."** The word *sabbaton* can refer to either weekly or annual sabbaths. The identification as ceremonial sabbaths relies on the Old Testament triad pattern and the Leviticus 23:38 distinction. While these indicators are strong, the text of Colossians 2:16 itself does not add the qualifier "ceremonial."

- **No single verse contains the statement "the cheirographon is the ceremonial law."** The identification is built from multiple lines of evidence -- the word's etymology, the usage of *dogma*, and Paul's own description in Colossians 2:20-22 -- but it is never stated in one sentence.

- **The study cannot prove Paul's intent with certainty.** What can be shown is what the words mean, how they are used elsewhere, and what the Old Testament background indicates. Paul's inner intention is accessible only through his words.

- **No New Testament passage explicitly says "the weekly Sabbath is still binding."** Hebrews 4:9 comes closest with *sabbatismos*, but the Sabbath's continuation is established by its membership in the Decalogue, its creation grounding, and the absence of any explicit abolition -- not by a single proof-text that says "keep the weekly Sabbath."

## Conclusion

The three passages most commonly cited as abolishing the weekly Sabbath -- Colossians 2:16-17, Romans 14:5, and Galatians 4:9-10 -- do not name the weekly Sabbath. Colossians 2:14 describes a "hand-written document of ordinances" being nailed to the cross, using vocabulary that consistently refers to ceremonial regulations, not to the God-written Decalogue. The feast/new moon/sabbath triad in Colossians 2:16 matches a well-established Old Testament pattern for the ceremonial calendar. The word "shadow" in the New Testament is always applied to the ceremonial system, never to the moral law. Romans 14:5 and Galatians 4:10 use generic words for "day" without mentioning the Sabbath, and their contexts address matters of personal opinion and circumcision respectively. Meanwhile, the Old Testament explicitly separates weekly sabbaths from feast sabbaths, the Fourth Commandment grounds the Sabbath in creation as a memorial (not a shadow), Paul in his own letters affirms the Decalogue as holy, just, good, and established by faith, and Hebrews 4:9 states that a Sabbath-keeping remains for the people of God. The biblical evidence, taken together, does not support the claim that these passages abolish the weekly Sabbath.
