# Analysis: Do Colossians 2:16-17 and Romans 14:5 Abolish the Weekly Sabbath?

## Methodology
This study follows the investigative methodology defined in `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-series-methodology.md`. The investigator states what the text says.

---

## 1. Colossians 2:14 -- What Was Nailed to the Cross?

### 1.1 The Greek Text

The Greek of Col 2:14 reads: *exaleipsas to kath' hemon cheirographon tois dogmasin ho en hupenantion hemin, kai auto erken ek tou mesou, proselosas auto to stauro.*

KJV: "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross."

### 1.2 Cheirographon (G5498)

Cheirographon is a hapax legomenon (appears only once in the NT). It is a compound: cheir (G5495, "hand") + grapho (G1125, "write") = "something hand-written." The Accusative Singular Neuter form (cheirographon) is the direct object of exaleipsas ("having blotted out") and proselosas ("having nailed").

The text states that what was nailed to the cross was a hand-written document. The Decalogue was "written with the finger of God" (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10). The book of the law was written by Moses' hand (Deu 31:9, 24). The compound word cheirographon (hand-written) lexically aligns with Moses' writing, not God's writing.

### 1.3 Tois Dogmasin (G1378, Dative Plural Neuter)

The dative plural tois dogmasin qualifies the cheirographon. Dogma (G1378) appears 5 times in the NT:

1. Luke 2:1 -- Caesar's civil decree
2. Acts 16:4 -- Jerusalem Council's ecclesiastical decrees
3. Acts 17:7 -- Caesar's civil decrees
4. Eph 2:15 -- "the law of commandments contained in ordinances [en dogmasin]" (what was abolished)
5. Col 2:14 -- "the handwriting of ordinances [tois dogmasin]" (what was nailed)

Dogma is used for civil decrees (Caesar) and ecclesiastical decisions (Jerusalem Council), and in the two primary NT cessation passages (Col 2:14; Eph 2:15). It is never used for the Decalogue or the moral law in any NT passage.

### 1.4 The Relative Pronoun and Neuter Agreement

The relative pronoun ho (Nom Sg Neuter) agrees with cheirographon (neuter), confirming the referent of "which was against us" is the hand-written document, not "the law" (nomos, masculine) or "the commandments" (entolai, feminine plural).

### 1.5 Col 2:20-22 Identifies the Ordinances

Paul returns to the same root in Col 2:20: "Why...are ye subject to ordinances [dogmatizesthe, G1379]?" Dogmatizo is the verbal form of dogma -- the same word family as v.14. Paul then identifies these ordinances: "Touch not; taste not; handle not; which all are to perish with the using; after the commandments and doctrines of men [entalmata kai didaskalias ton anthropon]" (vv.21-22). The phrase "commandments and doctrines of men" identifies the nature of what Paul is addressing: human-origin regulations, not the God-spoken, God-written Decalogue.

### 1.6 The Oun (Therefore) Connective

Col 2:16 begins with oun ("therefore"): "Let no man **therefore** judge you." The conjunction oun connects v.16 to v.14 causally. The freedom from judgment in v.16 is presented as a CONSEQUENCE of what was nailed in v.14. Whatever was nailed (the cheirographon tois dogmasin) is the basis for the items mentioned in v.16.

---

## 2. Colossians 2:16 -- The Ceremonial Triad

### 2.1 The Five Items in Col 2:16

The text lists five items in two groups:

**Group 1** (food/drink): "in meat [brosei] or in drink [posei]"
**Group 2** (calendar observances): "in respect of an holyday [heortes], or of the new moon [neomenias], or of the sabbath days [sabbaton]"

### 2.2 The OT Ceremonial Triad Pattern

The triad "feasts/new moons/sabbaths" appears repeatedly in the OT in ceremonial contexts:

| Passage | Triad Order | Context |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 1 Chr 23:31 | sabbaths, new moons, set feasts | burnt sacrifices |
| 2 Chr 2:4 | sabbaths, new moons, solemn feasts | burnt offerings |
| 2 Chr 8:13 | sabbaths, new moons, solemn feasts | offerings per Moses |
| 2 Chr 31:3 | sabbaths, new moons, set feasts | burnt offerings |
| Neh 10:33 | sabbaths, new moons, set feasts | temple service |
| Eze 45:17 | feasts, new moons, sabbaths | offerings to make reconciliation |
| Hos 2:11 | feast days, new moons, sabbaths | mirth to cease |
| Isa 1:13-14 | new moons, sabbaths... new moons, appointed feasts | God weary of them |

In every OT occurrence, this triad describes the ceremonial calendar system -- the annual/monthly/weekly cycle of sacrificial observances. The "sabbaths" in this triad are the sabbaths associated with the feast-and-sacrifice system.

### 2.3 The Ezekiel 45:17 Parallel

Eze 45:17 is the closest OT parallel to Col 2:16. The parallels are:

| Ezekiel 45:17 (Hebrew) | Colossians 2:16 (Greek) |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| burnt offerings (olot) | -- |
| meat offerings (minchah) | meat (brosei) |
| drink offerings (nesekh) | drink (posei) |
| feasts (chaggim) | holyday (heortes) |
| new moons (chadashim) | new moon (neomenias) |
| sabbaths (shabbatot) | sabbath days (sabbaton) |
| to make reconciliation (lekhapper) | -- |

The match between Eze 45:17 and Col 2:16 extends to both the categories (meat/drink/feast/new moon/sabbath) and the purpose: Eze 45:17's triad serves to "make reconciliation for the house of Israel" -- a ceremonial atonement function. The context in Ezekiel is the prince's ceremonial obligation, not the moral Decalogue.

### 2.4 The En Merei Construction

The phrase en merei (Col 2:16) = "in respect of" or "in the matter of." The three calendar items are governed by this phrase: en merei heortes e neomenias e sabbaton = "in the matter of a feast, or new moon, or sabbaths." The genitive cases (heortes Gen Sg F, neomenias Gen Sg F, sabbaton Gen Pl N) are governed by merei.

---

## 3. Colossians 2:16 -- Sabbaton: Plural and Referent

### 3.1 The Form in Col 2:16

Sabbaton in Col 2:16 is Genitive Plural Neuter (sabbaton, GPN). The text reads sabbaton, not sabbatou (Gen Sg).

### 3.2 The Semantic Range of Sabbaton (G4521)

Sabbaton (G4521) appears 68 times in the NT and can mean:
1. The weekly seventh-day Sabbath (most common usage)
2. A sabbath rest day of any kind (including annual ceremonial sabbaths)
3. A week (period of seven days)

The genitive plural form sabbaton is also used in weekly Sabbath contexts: Mat 12:1 ("on the sabbath day [tois sabbasin]"), Luk 4:16 ("on the sabbath day [te hemera ton sabbaton]"), Acts 13:14 ("the sabbath day [te hemera ton sabbaton]"). The plural form alone does not determine whether the referent is weekly or ceremonial sabbaths.

### 3.3 What Determines the Referent?

The word sabbaton in isolation does not resolve the question. Two factors determine the referent in Col 2:16:

**Factor 1 -- The triad context:** The word appears in the established OT ceremonial triad (feast/new moon/sabbath). In every OT occurrence of this triad, the "sabbaths" are the ceremonial calendar sabbaths associated with sacrificial observances.

**Factor 2 -- The cheirographon/dogma context:** The oun (therefore) in v.16 ties these items to what was nailed in v.14 -- the cheirographon tois dogmasin. Dogma is never used for the Decalogue. The items in v.16 are consequences of the dogma-qualified document being nailed.

**Factor 3 -- The Lev 23:37-38 distinction:** The OT itself separates the "sabbaths of the LORD" (weekly sabbaths) from the annual feasts using the preposition millibad ("beside/apart from"). This textual distinction, applied to Col 2:16 via SIS, indicates that the "sabbath" in the ceremonial triad is the feast-system sabbath, not the weekly "sabbath of the LORD."

## 4. Colossians 2:17 -- The Shadow (Skia) Designation

### 4.1 The Text

Col 2:17: "Which [ha, Nom Pl N] are a shadow [skia, Nom Sg F] of things to come [ton mellonton, Gen Pl N]; but the body [soma, Nom Sg N] is of Christ."

The relative pronoun ha (Nom Pl Neuter) refers back to the collective items of v.16 (meat, drink, feast, new moon, sabbaths). These items "are a shadow of things to come." The substance (soma) casting the shadow is Christ.

### 4.2 Skia (G4639) in the NT

Skia appears 7 times in the NT. Three uses are theological:

1. **Col 2:17** -- the items of v.16 are "a shadow of things to come"
2. **Heb 8:5** -- the earthly sanctuary priests "serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things"
3. **Heb 10:1** -- "the law having a shadow of good things to come...can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year...make the comers thereunto perfect"

The other 4 uses (Mat 4:16; Mrk 4:32; Luk 1:79; Acts 5:15) are literal physical shadows.

In all three theological uses, skia is applied to the ceremonial/sacrificial system. It is never applied to the Decalogue or the moral law.

### 4.3 The Zakar/Skia Directional Contrast

A shadow (skia) points FORWARD to "things to come" (mellonton). The weekly Sabbath uses zakar (H2142, "remember") -- a memorial verb that points BACKWARD to a completed past event: "For in six days the LORD **made** heaven and earth...and **rested** the seventh day" (Exo 20:11). Every verb in the Fourth Commandment's rationale is past tense.

| Category | Temporal Direction | Verb | Example |
|----------|-------------------|------|---------|
| Shadow (skia) | Present --> Future | mellonton (things coming) | Sacrifices anticipated Christ |
| Memorial (zakar) | Present <-- Past | zakar (remember) | Sabbath commemorates creation |

These are opposite temporal directions. The weekly Sabbath is a zakar-institution (memorial), not a skia-institution (shadow). *(Examined in depth in sabbath-shadow-or-memorial.)*

### 4.4 The Five Shadow Criteria

From the three theological uses of skia, a biblical shadow must:
1. Point forward to future things (mellonton)
2. Be a copy of the reality, not the reality itself
3. Be replaced when the substance arrives
4. Belong to the ceremonial system
5. Be temporary by design (Heb 9:10: "imposed until the time of reformation")

The weekly Sabbath:
1. Points backward to creation (Exo 20:11) -- does not meet criterion
2. Is the original creation rest (Gen 2:2-3) -- does not meet criterion
3. "Remaineth" after the cross (Heb 4:9, sabbatismos) -- does not meet criterion
4. Is in the Decalogue (Exo 20:8-11) -- does not meet criterion
5. Is called "perpetual covenant" (Exo 31:16) and continues in the new earth (Isa 66:23) -- does not meet criterion

## 5. Romans 14:5 -- Context and Content

### 5.1 The Text

Rom 14:5: "One man esteemeth [krinei, Pres Act Ind] one day [hemeran] above another [par' hemeran]: another esteemeth every day [pasan hemeran] alike. Let every man be fully persuaded [plerophorestho, Pres Pass Impv] in his own mind [noi]."

### 5.2 Does the Text Name the Sabbath?

The text does not name the Sabbath. The word sabbaton (G4521) does not appear in Rom 14:5 or anywhere in Romans 14. The text uses the generic hemera (G2250, "day") without qualification. The "day" is unspecified.

### 5.3 The "Doubtful Disputations" Genre

Rom 14:1 sets the genre for the chapter: "Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations [me eis diakriseis dialogismon]." The phrase diakriseis dialogismon = "disputes about opinions/reasonings." This classifies everything that follows as matters of personal conviction, not settled doctrine.

The items discussed in Romans 14:
- **Eating:** v.2 ("one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs"), v.3, v.6, v.14 ("there is nothing unclean of itself"), v.15, v.17, v.20-21
- **Days:** v.5-6 ("one man esteemeth one day above another")
- **Drinking:** v.17, v.21 ("nor to drink wine")

The eating/day pairing suggests the "days" are related to food practices -- fasting days, feast days, or dietary observance days. The text pairs day-regard with eating, treating both as the same category of disputable matter (v.6: "he that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord...he that eateth, eateth to the Lord").

### 5.4 Nave's Classification

Nave's Topical Bible classifies Rom 14:1-23 under CONSCIENCE and Rom 14:1-6 under COMMANDMENTS OF MEN -- not under SABBATH and not under COMMANDMENTS (divine). Nave's does not list Rom 14:5 as a Sabbath reference. The SABBATH topic in Nave's lists Col 2:16 and Heb 4:4,9 but omits Rom 14:5.

### 5.5 Paul's Moral Law Affirmations in the Same Epistle

In the same epistle (Romans), Paul:
- **Rom 3:31:** "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."
- **Rom 7:7:** "I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." Paul identifies "the law" as the Decalogue (10th commandment).
- **Rom 7:12:** "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."
- **Rom 7:14:** "The law is spiritual."
- **Rom 8:4:** "The righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
- **Rom 13:8-10:** Paul lists Decalogue commandments (adultery, murder, theft, bearing false witness, coveting) as the content of the love-law.

Paul affirms the Decalogue as holy, just, good, spiritual, and established by faith within the same epistle. For Paul to place a Decalogue commandment in the category of "doubtful disputations" (Rom 14:1) would contradict his own statements within the same letter.

### 5.6 What "Days" Are in View?

The text does not specify. The alternatives:
- **Jewish fast days** (Monday and Thursday fasting, mentioned in Luke 18:12; Didache 8): private devotional practice, a matter of personal conviction
- **Jewish feast days**: observance of annual festivals, consistent with the eating context
- **Market days** or other cultural observance days

The identification of the "day" as the Sabbath requires adding a referent the text does not state.

## 6. Galatians 4:9-10 -- The "Days" Parallel

### 6.1 The Text

Gal 4:9-10: "But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements [ta asthene kai ptocha stoicheia], whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? Ye observe days [hemeras], and months [menas], and times [kairous], and years [eniautous]."

### 6.2 The Context

The Galatians were formerly Gentile pagans (Gal 4:8: "when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods"). The specific controversy in Galatians is circumcision: Gal 5:2 ("if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing"), Gal 6:12-13 (those who "constrain you to be circumcised"). The Galatians were being pressured to adopt the ceremonial system as necessary for salvation.

### 6.3 The Calendar List

"Days, months, times, years" aligns with the ceremonial calendar:
- **Days** (hemeras): annual feast days
- **Months** (menas): new moon observances
- **Times** (kairous): appointed seasons (moadim)
- **Years** (eniautous): sabbatical years, jubilee years

The text does not name the Sabbath. The word sabbaton does not appear in Galatians 4:10.

### 6.4 The Stoicheia

The "weak and beggarly elements" (stoicheia) to which the Galatians were returning is debated. Paul says they desire "again" (palin) to be in bondage. Since the Galatians were formerly Gentile pagans who never observed the Mosaic law, the "again" points to a return to the bondage principle (works-based religious observance), not specifically to Torah observance they had practiced before.

### 6.5 Comparison with Romans 14:5

| Feature | Galatians 4:9-10 | Romans 14:5 |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Word for "day" | hemera | hemera |
| Sabbath named? | No | No |
| Context | Circumcision controversy | Doubtful disputations |
| Tone | Warning against bondage | Tolerance of different practices |
| Audience | Gentile converts | Mixed community |

Both passages use the generic hemera without specifying the Sabbath. Both address ceremonial calendar observances in different pastoral contexts.

## 7. Paul's Consistency Across Epistles

### 7.1 The Same-Author, Same-Epistle Evidence

**In Ephesians:** Paul abolishes "the law of commandments contained in ordinances [ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin]" (Eph 2:15), then quotes the 5th Decalogue commandment as binding: "Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment [entole] with promise" (Eph 6:2-3). The same author in the same epistle treats dogma-qualified ordinances as abolished and the Decalogue as authoritative.

**In Romans:** Paul says "we establish the law" (Rom 3:31), calls the Decalogue "holy, just, and good" (Rom 7:12), "spiritual" (Rom 7:14), and says "the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us" (Rom 8:4). In the same epistle, Rom 14:5 addresses "days" without naming the Sabbath, in the context of "doubtful disputations."

**In 1 Corinthians:** "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God [entole tou theou]" (1 Cor 7:19). Paul distinguishes ceremonial law (circumcision = nothing) from moral commandments (entole tou theou = everything).

### 7.2 The Vocabulary Partition

Paul's vocabulary across his epistles shows a pattern:
- **Cessation vocabulary** (what was abolished): dogma, cheirographon, dikaiomata sarkos, katargeo + dogma-qualified law
- **Continuation vocabulary** (what remains): entole (unqualified), nomos when characterized as holy/just/good/spiritual, "commandments of God"

These vocabulary sets are largely non-overlapping. The cessation terms are never applied to the Decalogue; the continuation terms are never applied to what was abolished.

---

## 8. The Lev 23:37-38 Distinction Applied

### 8.1 The Text of Lev 23:37-38

Lev 23:37: "These are the feasts [moadei] of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day."

Lev 23:38: "Beside [millibad] the sabbaths of the LORD [shabbetot YHWH], and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD."

### 8.2 The Millibad Separation

The compound preposition millibad (min + le + bad = "from-to-separation" = "apart from/beside") appears four times in v.38, each time separating a category from the feasts summarized in v.37:

1. millibad the sabbaths of the LORD
2. millibad your gifts
3. millibad all your vows
4. millibad all your freewill offerings

The text grammatically separates "the sabbaths of the LORD" (the weekly Sabbaths) from the annual feasts. The Hebrew is explicit.

### 8.3 Application to Col 2:16 (SIS)

The SIS (Scripture Interprets Scripture) principle: a clear passage governs the reading of an ambiguous one. Lev 23:37-38 is clear (legal prose, explicit separating preposition, fourfold repetition). Col 2:16 is ambiguous (sabbaton's semantic range allows both weekly and ceremonial). The clear passage determines: the OT itself distinguishes weekly sabbaths from feast-system sabbaths, and the Col 2:16 triad (feast/new moon/sabbath) matches the OT ceremonial triad, not the weekly Sabbath category.

---

## 9. Summary of Textual Observations

### 9.1 What the Texts State

1. Col 2:14 says the cheirographon tois dogmasin (hand-written document of ordinances) was nailed to the cross.
2. Cheirographon means "hand-written." The Decalogue was written by God's finger (Exo 31:18).
3. Dogma (G1378) is never used for the Decalogue in the NT.
4. Col 2:16 lists the items using the oun (therefore) connective, tying them to what was nailed.
5. The heorte-neomenia-sabbaton triad matches the OT ceremonial triad (2 Chr 31:3; Eze 45:17; Hos 2:11).
6. Eze 45:17 uses the same categories in the same order as Col 2:16, for the purpose of "making reconciliation."
7. Col 2:17 calls these items "a shadow of things to come."
8. Skia in all three NT theological uses is applied to the ceremonial system, never to the Decalogue.
9. Col 2:20-22 identifies the ordinances as "commandments and doctrines of men."
10. Rom 14:5 does not name the Sabbath. The word sabbaton does not appear.
11. Rom 14:1 classifies the topic as "doubtful disputations."
12. Paul in the same epistle (Romans) affirms the moral law/Decalogue as holy, just, good, spiritual, and established by faith.
13. Gal 4:10 does not name the Sabbath. The word sabbaton does not appear.
14. Lev 23:37-38 explicitly separates the "sabbaths of the LORD" from the annual feasts using millibad.

### 9.2 What the Texts Do Not State

1. Col 2:16 does not say "the weekly Sabbath."
2. Col 2:16 does not say "the Fourth Commandment."
3. Col 2:16 does not say "the Decalogue."
4. Rom 14:5 does not name any specific day.
5. Gal 4:10 does not name the Sabbath.
6. No NT passage says "the Sabbath is a shadow of Christ" or "Christ our Sabbath."
7. No NT passage says "the Decalogue was nailed to the cross."
8. No NT passage names the Ten Commandments as abolished.
