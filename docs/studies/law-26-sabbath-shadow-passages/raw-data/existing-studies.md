# Existing Studies -- Summaries Relevant to law-26

## law-08: What Was Abolished at the Cross?
**Key findings for this study:**
- Col 2:14 uses cheirographon (hand-written) + dogmasin (ordinances). The Decalogue was written by "the finger of God" (Exo 31:18). None of 7 abolition passages names the Decalogue.
- Dogma (G1378) is never used for the Decalogue -- all 5 uses are civil or ceremonial.
- Col 2:16-17 classified as Neutral (E055) -- the referent of "sabbath days" is ambiguous.
- I7 inference: "sabbath days in Col 2:16 include the weekly Sabbath" classified as I-B (Abolished), resolved Moderate toward Continues because the OT triad pattern matches the ceremonial calendar.
- Same-epistle observation: Eph 2:15 abolishes dogma-qualified law while Eph 6:2-3 cites the 5th Decalogue commandment as binding.

## law-24: Weekly Sabbath vs Ceremonial Sabbaths
**Key findings for this study:**
- Lev 23:37-38: millibad explicitly separates "the sabbaths of the LORD" from the feast sabbaths. Classified E4 (Continues).
- Two vocabulary levels: shabbath shabbathown vs shabbathown alone; kol-melakhah vs melekhet abodah.
- Num 28-29 places the Sabbath in its own offering category between daily and monthly.
- The weekly Sabbath is never called moed (H4150) or chag (H2282).
- OT ceremonial triad (feasts/new moons/sabbaths) in 2 Chr 31:3, Eze 45:17, Hos 2:11 matches Col 2:16.
- I2 inference: referent of sabbaton in Col 2:16 = ceremonial sabbaths (I-B), resolved Moderate toward Continues.

## law-25: Sabbath Moral or Ceremonial?
**Key findings for this study:**
- Seven criteria tested: creation origin, Decalogue membership, delivery mode, Lev 23 separation, typological function, Heb 4:9 sabbatismos, universal scope.
- Sabbath aligns with every moral-law marker and none of the ceremonial markers.
- Col 2:16-17 classified Neutral (E18/E055) -- sabbaton referent ambiguous.
- Rom 14:5 classified Neutral (E39/E499) -- text does not name the Sabbath.
- I5 inference: Rom 14:5 "days" = the Sabbath (I-B, Abolished), resolved Moderate toward Continues. Paul would not place a Decalogue commandment in "doubtful disputations."
- 17 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished E-items.

## law-04: Ceremonial Laws
**Key findings for this study:**
- Skia (G4639) applied to the ceremonial system in 3 passages (Heb 10:1, Col 2:17, Heb 8:5), never to the moral law or Decalogue. Classified N017.
- Every ceremonial regulation uses the mediated delivery formula ("the LORD spake unto Moses").
- Lev 23:37-38 classified E127 (Continues) -- explicit distinction.

## law-20: NT Greek Law Vocabulary
**Key findings for this study:**
- Cheirographon: cheir + grapho = hand-written. The Decalogue was God-written.
- Dogma = never for moral law. Entole (unqualified) = consistently moral commands.
- The dative tois dogmasin in Col 2:14: three possible readings (instrumental, locative, reference). All three still identify the referent as ordinances/decrees.
- Vocabulary distribution map: dogma = exclusively non-moral; entole (unqualified) = exclusively moral.
- Col 2:20-22: Paul identifies the "ordinances" as "commandments and doctrines of men."

## law-21: NT Vocab Law Categories
- Systematic mapping of all NT law vocabulary occurrences to law categories.
- Affirm and abolish passages use different vocabulary sets (largely non-overlapping).

## law-13: Jesus and Sabbath
- Col 2:16-17 analysis: the heorte-neomenia-sabbaton triad matches OT ceremonial triad.
- Every recorded Sabbath controversy shows Jesus arguing WITHIN the Sabbath framework.
- Post-crucifixion evidence: Luk 23:56 ("according to the commandment"), Mat 24:20.

## law-16: Paul and Law in Romans
- Paul's law affirmations in Romans: Rom 3:31, 7:7, 7:12, 7:14, 8:4.
- The law is holy, just, good, spiritual. Faith establishes the law.

## law-17: Paul and Law in Galatians
- Gal 4:9-10: stoicheia as "weak and beggarly elements"; "days, months, times, years" in ceremonial calendar context.
- The Galatians were formerly Gentile pagans (4:8) who had never observed the Mosaic law.
- "Again" (palin) = returning to bondage -- not to something they previously kept, but to a bondage system.

## sabbath-shadow-or-memorial
**Key findings for this study:**
- The Sabbath uses zakar ("remember") pointing BACKWARD to creation. The ceremonial system uses skia ("shadow") pointing FORWARD to Christ. These are opposite temporal directions.
- The Sabbath fails ALL 5 shadow criteria: (1) does not point forward, (2) is the original not a copy, (3) not replaced by Christ, (4) part of the Decalogue not the ceremonial code, (5) "perpetual covenant" not temporary by design.
- Sabbatismos (G4520) = "sabbath-keeping" (-ismos suffix = practice). Apoleipetai (Present Passive) = "is currently remaining."
- The "sabbath days" in Col 2:16 called "shadow" are the annual ceremonial feast-system sabbaths, listed in the established OT triad.

## law-01: God's Moral Law
**Key findings for this study:**
- The Decalogue is distinguished from all other legislation by seven unique markers: spoken by God's voice, written by God's finger, on stone, inside the ark, "he added no more," called "the covenant," called "the testimony."
- Attributes of the law (holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, eternal) are the same attributes ascribed to God Himself.
- 45 E-items classified; all positional E-items are Continues; 0 Abolished.
- Col 2:14 (E54): cheirographon tois dogmasin classified as Continues -- dogma identifies ceremonial ordinances, not the Decalogue. The vocabulary partition (dogma vs entole) evidences different law categories.
- Col 2:16-17 (E55): classified Neutral -- the referent of "sabbath days" is ambiguous between weekly and annual.
- Eph 2:15 (E53): abolishes "the law of commandments contained in ordinances" (dogma) -- reclassified as Continues because the use of dogma (not nomos/entole) evidences a law-type distinction.
- The law's scope extends before Sinai (Gen 26:5), beyond Israel (Rom 2:14-15), into the new covenant (Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10), and to the end (Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14).

## sabbath-still-in-effect
**Key findings for this study:**
- Capstone study building on 7 prior studies. Conclusion: the Sabbath remains binding.
- Logical syllogism: If the moral law remains (premises 1,4,5,6) and the Sabbath is moral law (premise 7), then the Sabbath remains.
- Heb 4:9 sabbatismos = "sabbath-keeping" (present passive indicative "is left remaining").
- Post-crucifixion evidence: Luk 23:56 ("according to the commandment"), Acts 17:2; 16:13; 18:4 (Paul's settled custom), Mat 24:20 (Jesus expects Sabbath observance decades after the cross).
- Objection texts (Col 2:16; Rom 14:5; Gal 4:10) all refer to ceremonial observances, not the Decalogue.
- No biblical command exists to transfer the Sabbath to the first day of the week.

## isaiah-66-new-moon-sabbath
**Key findings for this study:**
- Isa 66:22-23: in the new earth, "all flesh" worships on both sabbath (weekly) and new moon (monthly).
- The sabbath in Isa 66:23 is the weekly Sabbath (not annual feast sabbaths): monthly/weekly pairing is natural; Isaiah consistently uses sabbath for the weekly day (Isa 56:2,4,6; 58:13); creation basis suits "new creation" context.
- The new moon and sabbath are distinct but complementary observances representing monthly and weekly worship cycles.
- Col 2:16-17 addresses the ceremonial aspects (specific offerings, rituals = "shadows"); the creation-rooted weekly sabbath as worship/rest is not abolished. Isaiah 66:23 places both in the eternal state.
- Resolution: sacrificial shadows are fulfilled; worship patterns continue.
