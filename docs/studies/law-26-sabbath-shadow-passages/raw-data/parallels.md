| Ecc 3:17 | 0.307 | judge |
Note: NO sabbath-specific OT parallels found for Rom 14:5. All parallels are about judging, not about days or sabbaths.

## Rom 14:5 -- NT Parallels (hybrid scoring)
| Reference | Score | Key Terms |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 Cor 2:15 | 0.364 | however, judge |
| Jas 4:12 | 0.348 | however, judge |
| Rom 2:1 | 0.339 | judge |
| Jas 4:11 | 0.338 | however, judge |
| 2 Tim 4:8 | 0.332 | however, judge |
| Jhn 5:22 | 0.330 | judge |
| Jhn 7:24 | 0.329 | judge |
Note: NO sabbath-specific NT parallels found for Rom 14:5. All parallels relate to judging/discerning, not to sabbath days.

## Col 2:14 -- OT Parallels (hybrid scoring)
| Reference | Score | Key Terms |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Neh 10:1 | 0.287 | (written document) |
| Isa 43:25 | 0.251 | (blotting out) |
| Deu 22:17 | 0.249 | (written document) |
Note: Relatively low scores -- cheirographon is a hapax legomenon with no direct OT equivalent.

## Col 2:14 -- NT Parallels (hybrid scoring)
| Reference | Score | Key Terms |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Luk 24:29 | 0.322 | (proximity) |
| 3 Jhn 1:10 | 0.307 | against |
| Mrk 14:57 | 0.304 | against |
| Acts 6:13 | 0.303 | against |
Note: Low scores; the concept of nailing a hand-written document to the cross is unique to Col 2:14.

## Eze 45:17 -- NT Parallels (hybrid scoring)
| Reference | Score | Key Terms |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Heb 9:9 | 0.327 | offer, present |
| Luk 2:32 | 0.321 | |
| Acts 5:31 | 0.316 | iniquity |
| Acts 13:23 | 0.316 | |
| Luk 24:47 | 0.313 | iniquity |
| Acts 13:27 | 0.311 | sabbath |
| 1 Cor 10:18 | 0.309 | |
| Heb 8:8 | 0.304 | |
| Heb 8:10 | 0.304 | |
Note: Heb 9:9 is the strongest match -- "gifts and sacrifices...that could not make him that did the service perfect." The Eze 45:17 ceremonial offering system (burnt/meat/drink offerings in feasts/new moons/sabbaths "to make reconciliation") parallels the Hebrews description of the shadow system. Acts 13:27 connects sabbaths to synagogue readings.

## 2 Chr 31:3 -- NT Parallels (hybrid scoring)
| Reference | Score | Key Terms |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Mrk 15:42 | 0.364 | even, sabbath |
| Mrk 2:28 | 0.363 | even, sabbath |
| Mat 12:8 | 0.347 | sabbath |
| Acts 28:23 | 0.337 | even, morn |
| Mrk 2:27 | 0.335 | sabbath |
| Mat 12:2 | 0.335 | sabbath |
| Luk 6:5 | 0.329 | sabbath |
| Mrk 2:24 | 0.329 | sabbath |
| Acts 17:2 | 0.326 | sabbath |
| Mat 28:1 | 0.324 | sabbath |
Note: Strong sabbath parallels. The 2 Chr 31:3 triad ("sabbaths, new moons, set feasts") generates numerous NT sabbath matches, confirming the ceremonial calendar connection.

## Hos 2:11 (Hebrew 2:13) -- NT Parallels (hybrid scoring)
| Reference | Score | Key Terms |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Mrk 15:42 | 0.292 | sabbath |
| Heb 4:9 | 0.292 | |
| Luk 23:54 | 0.288 | sabbath |
| Mat 24:20 | 0.287 | sabbath |
| Luk 13:14 | 0.284 | sabbath |
| Jhn 5:9 | 0.276 | sabbath |
| Luk 6:23 | 0.276 | joy |
| Rom 14:17 | 0.263 | cease, joy |
| 1 Cor 5:8 | 0.262 | |
| Luk 23:56 | 0.259 | cease, sabbath |
Note: Hos 2:11 (KJV) / 2:13 (Hebrew) contains the triad "her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths." The parallel to Heb 4:9 and Luk 23:56 is notable. Rom 14:17 matches on "cease" and "joy" -- but in a different context (kingdom = righteousness/peace/joy, not food/drink).

## Lev 23:38 -- NT Parallels (hybrid scoring)
| Reference | Score | Key Terms |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Mat 20:14 | 0.297 | |
| 2 Cor 9:6 | 0.281 | |
| Mat 12:11 | 0.275 | sabbath |
| Mat 12:8 | 0.270 | sabbath |
| Heb 13:5 | 0.265 | present |
Note: Low scores overall. The millibad ("beside/apart from") separation concept is unique to the OT and has no direct NT vocabulary parallel. The sabbath keyword matches are incidental. The critical point about Lev 23:38 is not its NT parallels but its internal OT function of distinguishing weekly sabbaths from feast sabbaths.
