## Summary Answer

Colossians 2:14 states that the cheirographon tois dogmasin (hand-written document of ordinances) was nailed to the cross. Cheirographon (G5498) means "hand-written" (cheir + grapho). The Decalogue was written by "the finger of God" (Exo 31:18). Dogma (G1378) appears 5 times in the NT and is never used for the Decalogue. Col 2:16 uses the conjunction oun ("therefore") to connect the items in v.16 to what was nailed in v.14. The triad heorte-neomenia-sabbaton (feast/new moon/sabbath) in Col 2:16 matches the OT ceremonial triad pattern found in 2 Chr 31:3, Eze 45:17, Hos 2:11, 1 Chr 23:31, 2 Chr 2:4, 2 Chr 8:13, and Neh 10:33. Eze 45:17 uses the same categories in the same order as Col 2:16 (meat offerings, drink offerings, feasts, new moons, sabbaths) for the purpose of "making reconciliation" -- a ceremonial atonement function. Col 2:17 calls these items "a shadow [skia] of things to come." Skia in all three NT theological uses (Col 2:17; Heb 8:5; Heb 10:1) is applied to the ceremonial system, never to the Decalogue. The weekly Sabbath uses zakar ("remember," Exo 20:8) pointing backward to creation -- the opposite temporal direction of skia, which points forward. Col 2:20-22 identifies the ordinances as "commandments and doctrines of men." Lev 23:37-38 explicitly separates the "sabbaths of the LORD" (weekly) from the annual feasts using millibad ("beside/apart from").

Rom 14:5 does not name the Sabbath. The word sabbaton does not appear in Romans 14. The text uses the generic hemera ("day") without specification. Rom 14:1 classifies the topic as "doubtful disputations" (diakriseis dialogismon) -- matters of personal conviction, not settled doctrine. Paul in the same epistle affirms the moral law as holy, just, good (Rom 7:12), spiritual (Rom 7:14), established by faith (Rom 3:31), and identifies it as the Decalogue (Rom 7:7). Gal 4:10 likewise does not name the Sabbath; its context addresses circumcision (Gal 5:2; 6:12-13) and the ceremonial system.

## Key Verses

**Colossians 2:14** -- "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;"

**Colossians 2:16-17** -- "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ."

**Leviticus 23:37-38** -- "These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day: Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD."

**Ezekiel 45:17** -- "And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel."

**Hebrews 10:1** -- "For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect."

**Exodus 20:8-11** -- "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."

**Hebrews 4:9** -- "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God."

**Romans 14:5** -- "One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind."

| E11 | "One man esteemeth one day [hemeran] above another: another esteemeth every day [pasan hemeran] alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind." The text uses hemera (generic "day"), not sabbaton (Sabbath). The Sabbath is not named. | Rom 14:5 | Neutral | E499 (exists) |
| E12 | "Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations [diakriseis dialogismon]." The genre of Romans 14 is set by v.1 as matters of personal opinion/conviction, not settled doctrine. | Rom 14:1 | Neutral | E503 (new) |
| E13 | "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish [histanomen] the law." Paul emphatically denies making the law void; he establishes it. | Rom 3:31 | Continues | E025 (exists) |
| E14 | "I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." Paul identifies "the law" as the Decalogue by quoting the 10th commandment. "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (Rom 7:12). "The law is spiritual" (Rom 7:14). | Rom 7:7, 12, 14 | Continues | E010 (exists) |
| E15 | "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God [entole tou theou]." Paul distinguishes ceremony (circumcision = nothing) from moral commandments (entole tou theou = binding). | 1 Cor 7:19 | Continues | E143 (exists) |

| E18 | "How turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements [stoicheia], whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? Ye observe days [hemeras], and months [menas], and times [kairous], and years [eniautous]." The text does not name the Sabbath. The word sabbaton does not appear.

| E19 | "There remaineth therefore a rest [sabbatismos, G4520] to the people of God." Sabbatismos is a hapax legomenon (-ismos suffix = practice of Sabbath-keeping). The verb apoleipetai (Present Passive Indicative) = "is currently remaining." | Heb 4:9 | Continues | E337 (exists) |
| E20 | Numbers 28-29 organizes offerings by temporal frequency: daily (28:1-8), Sabbath (28:9-10), new moon (28:11-15), annual feasts (28:16-29:38). The Sabbath has its own offering category, structurally separate from the annual feast offerings. | Num 28:9-10 | Continues | E482 (exists) |
| E21 | Colossians 2:14 uses dogmasin (Dat Pl N); Col 2:20 uses dogmatizesthe (G1379, verbal form of dogma). Paul uses the same word family in both verses, linking what was nailed (v.14) to the ordinances the Colossians were submitting to (v.20). | Col 2:14, 20 | Neutral | E363 (exists) |
| E22 | The weekly Sabbath is never called a moed (H4150, appointed feast/time) in Lev 23 or elsewhere. The weekly Sabbath is never called a chag (H2282, festival/pilgrimage feast). These terms are used for the annual feasts. | Lev 23; Exo 23:14-17 | Neutral | E487/E488 (exist) |

### Tree 3 Positional Traces

**E1 (Continues):** V1: Yes -- cheirographon = hand-written, distinguishing what was nailed from the God-written Decalogue; dogma identifies the target as ordinances, not the moral law. Gate 1: PASS -- cheirographon + dogma identify a specific category (not the Decalogue). Gate 2: PASS -- auto (neuter) refers to cheirographon (neuter). Gate 3: PASS -- didactic epistle. Gate 4: PASS -- consistent with E053, E054. Classification stands.

**E2 (Neutral):** V2: Yes candidate -- "shadow" is cessation vocabulary. Gate 1: FAIL -- "sabbath days" referent is ambiguous; could be annual ceremonial sabbaths or the weekly Sabbath. RC1: Referent ambiguous. RC3: Neither V1 nor V2 clearly applies to the moral law specifically. -> Neutral.

**E10 (Continues):** V1: Yes -- the text itself draws a distinction between feast sabbaths and "the sabbaths of the LORD." Gate 1: PASS -- "sabbaths of the LORD" is identified by v.38's context as weekly sabbaths (the feasts are v.37). Gate 2: PASS -- millibad unambiguously separates. Gate 3: PASS -- legal prose. Gate 4: PASS -- consistent with E482, E481. Classification stands.

**E11 (Neutral):** V2: No -- the text does not use cessation vocabulary; it discusses personal esteem of days. V1: No -- no continuation vocabulary for the moral law. -> Neutral.

**E13-E14 (Continues):** V1: Yes -- law continuation vocabulary (establish, holy, just, good, spiritual). All four gates pass. See law-16 for full traces.

**E17 (Continues):** V1: Yes -- "Remember" = continuation vocabulary for the Sabbath commandment in the Decalogue. Gate 1: PASS -- the Sabbath is the identified subject. Gate 2: PASS. Gate 3: PASS -- legal/didactic. Gate 4: PASS. Classification stands.

**E19 (Continues):** V1: Yes -- sabbatismos "remaineth" = continuation vocabulary. Gate 1: PASS -- sabbatismos = Sabbath-keeping. Gate 2: PASS. Gate 3: PASS -- didactic epistle. Gate 4: PASS. Classification stands.

**Neutral items (E2-E9, E11-E12, E18, E21-E22):** Factual textual observations both sides must accept. These are grammatical data, vocabulary facts, OT patterns, or passages with ambiguous referents that do not pass V1 or V2 for a specific positional direction.

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Why Unavoidable | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | Cheirographon (G5498), meaning "hand-written" (cheir + grapho), denotes a document of human authorship. The Decalogue was "written with the finger of God" (Exo 31:18). These are lexically different categories of authorship -- the cheirographon of Col 2:14 cannot be the Decalogue without overriding the word's own etymology. | E3 (cheirographon definition + Decalogue authorship) | Continues | Hand-written and God-written are lexically different agents by the compound word's definition. No reader can deny that cheir (hand) differs from "finger of God." | N098 (exists) |
| N2 | The NT cessation vocabulary (dogma, cheirographon) is never used for the Decalogue. Dogma appears 5 times, always for civil decrees or ceremonial ordinances (E4). Cheirographon means "hand-written" -- the Decalogue was God-written (E3). | E3, E4 | Continues | Verifiable by word search: dogma never modifies the Decalogue. The presence/absence of a word in connection with the Decalogue is an observable lexical fact. | N018 (exists) |
| N3 | Leviticus 23:37-38 places the "sabbaths of the LORD" in a category SEPARATE FROM the annual feasts. The preposition millibad means "apart from/beside." The fourfold repetition makes the separation emphatic. | E10 | Continues | The text says these feasts are "beside" the sabbaths of the LORD. The preposition millibad creates a grammatical separation. No reader can deny that millibad means separation. | N021 (exists) |
| N4 | The conjunction oun ("therefore") in Col 2:16 causally connects the items in v.16 to the nailing in v.14. The food/drink/feast/new moon/sabbath items are presented as consequences of the cheirographon tois dogmasin being nailed. | E1, E2 | Neutral | Oun is a causal/inferential conjunction. Its grammatical function of connecting v.16 to v.14 is observable. Both sides acknowledge the connection -- they differ on what was nailed. | N126 (new) |
| N5 | The heorte-neomenia-sabbaton triad in Col 2:16 matches the same triad (feast/new moon/sabbath) used in OT ceremonial contexts (2 Chr 31:3; Eze 45:17; Hos 2:11; 1 Chr 23:31; 2 Chr 2:4; 2 Chr 8:13; Neh 10:33; Isa 1:13-14). | E2, E6 | Neutral | The correspondence is observable: heorte = feast, neomenia = new moon, sabbaton = sabbath. Both sides acknowledge the triad pattern exists. The question of whether Col 2:16 uses it the same way is inference-level. | N127 (new) |
| N6 | Rom 14:5 does not contain the word sabbaton (G4521). The text uses hemera (G2250, generic "day"). The Sabbath is not named in the passage. | E11 | Neutral | Verifiable by word search: sabbaton does not appear in Rom 14. Hemera is the word used. Both sides acknowledge this textual fact. | N128 (new) |
| N7 | Rom 14:1 classifies the subject matter of the chapter as diakriseis dialogismon ("disputes about opinions"). This is a genre classification stated by the text itself. | E12 | Neutral | The text states its own genre. Both sides acknowledge Paul uses this phrase. The question of what falls within "doubtful disputations" is inference-level. | N129 (new) |
| N8 | Skia (G4639) in all three NT theological uses (Col 2:17; Heb 8:5; Heb 10:1) is applied to the ceremonial/sacrificial system. It is never applied to the Decalogue or the moral law in any passage. | E2, E8, E9 | Neutral | Verifiable by word search: skia is applied to (1) the Col 2:16 triad, (2) the earthly sanctuary, (3) the annual sacrifices. It is never applied to the Ten Commandments. | N130 (new) |
| N9 | Eze 45:17 uses the same categories as Col 2:16 (meat offerings, drink offerings, feasts, new moons, sabbaths) in the same order, for the purpose of ceremonial reconciliation (lekhapper). | E7, E2 | Neutral | The correspondence is observable in the texts. Both sides acknowledge that Eze 45:17 and Col 2:16 share vocabulary. | N131 (new) |
| N10 | Gal 4:10 does not contain the word sabbaton (G4521). The text says "days [hemeras], months [menas], times [kairous], years [eniautous]." The Sabbath is not named. | E18 | Neutral | Verifiable by word search: sabbaton does not appear in Gal 4:10. | N132 (new) |

### Positional Classification of N-Items

**N1 (Continues):** The cheirographon/Decalogue authorship distinction supports the Continues position because it distinguishes what was nailed from the Decalogue. Gate 0: All three N-tests pass (universal agreement on etymology, no interpretation required, zero added concepts).

**N2 (Continues):** The cessation vocabulary never being used for the Decalogue supports the Continues position because it means the abolition passages do not target the Decalogue. Gate 0: All three tests pass.

**N3 (Continues):** The millibad separation is evidence that the Bible itself distinguishes weekly sabbaths from ceremonial sabbaths -- a distinction the Continues position depends on. Gate 0: All three tests pass.

**N4-N10 (Neutral):** Observable textual, grammatical, and vocabulary facts both sides acknowledge.

|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|---|
| I1 | The "handwriting of ordinances" (cheirographon tois dogmasin) in Col 2:14 refers to the ceremonial/regulatory law code, not the Decalogue or moral law. The items nailed to the cross are the ceremonial ordinances. | I-A | E1/E054 (Col 2:14: cheirographon nailed); E3/E250 (cheirographon = hand-written; Decalogue = God-written); E4/E249 (dogma never for Decalogue); E5/E254 (Col 2:20-22: "commandments and doctrines of men"); N1/N098 (hand-written vs God-written authorship distinction); N2/N018 (cessation vocabulary never for Decalogue). All components are from E/N tables. | Each E/N item addresses one aspect. The comprehensive claim that the cheirographon = the ceremonial law code systematizes multiple textual observations into a unified identification.

| I2 | The "sabbath days" (sabbaton) in Col 2:16, designated as "a shadow of things to come" (v.17), refers to the annual ceremonial sabbaths of the feast system, not the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue. | I-B | FOR: E6/E486 (OT ceremonial triad); E7/E492 (Eze 45:17 parallel); E10/E127 (Lev 23:38 millibad separation); N3/N021 (textual distinction); N5/N127 (triad pattern match); N8/N130 (skia = ceremonial); N9/N131 (Eze 45:17 categories match). AGAINST: E2/E055 (sabbaton has semantic range including weekly Sabbath; the text does not explicitly say "ceremonial sabbaths only"). | The text uses sabbaton without specifying which sabbaths. The identification as ceremonial sabbaths requires importing the Lev 23:37-38 distinction and the OT triad pattern. The identification as weekly sabbaths requires reading sabbaton in its weekly sense despite the triad context. Both readings require interpretive judgment. | #2 (choosing between readings), #4b (cross-referencing OT triad) | I023 (exists) |
| I3 | The "sabbath days" in Col 2:16 includes the weekly Sabbath, classifying it as "a shadow of things to come" that was fulfilled in Christ and abolished at the cross. | I-B | FOR: E2/E055 (sabbaton CAN refer to the weekly Sabbath; the annual-monthly-weekly sequence feast/new moon/sabbath COULD descend from yearly to weekly). AGAINST: E10/E127 (Lev 23:38 millibad separation of weekly sabbaths from feasts); E6/E486 (OT triad = ceremonial); E17/E086 (Sabbath grounded in creation, zakar = memorial pointing backward); E19/E337 (sabbatismos "remaineth"); N1/N098 (cheirographon = hand-written, not God-written); N2/N018 (cessation vocabulary never for Decalogue); N3/N021 (textual separation); N8/N130 (skia never applied to Decalogue). | To read sabbaton as the weekly Sabbath requires: (a) overriding the millibad separation (E10/N3); (b) calling a zakar-institution (memorial) a skia (shadow) despite opposite temporal directions; (c) making the cheirographon/dogma context include the Decalogue despite N1/N2. | #2 (choosing meaning); overrides E10, E17, N1, N2, N3 | I141 (exists) |
| I4 | The "day" in Romans 14:5 includes the weekly Sabbath, making it a matter of individual conscience rather than settled doctrine. | I-B | FOR: "One man esteemeth one day above another" could conceivably include any day. AGAINST: E11/E499 (text does not name the Sabbath; N6/N128 confirms sabbaton absent); E12/E493 (Rom 14:1 = "doubtful disputations"); E13/E025 (Paul establishes the law in Romans); E14/E010 (Paul identifies the Decalogue as holy/just/good in Romans); E17/E086 (Sabbath in Decalogue, creation-grounded); E15/E143 (Paul distinguishes ceremony from commandments); N7/N129 (genre = disputes about opinions). | The text says "one day" without specifying which. Identifying the Sabbath requires adding a referent the text does not state. The classification as "doubtful disputations" (E12/N7) is inconsistent with Decalogue status. Paul's own Decalogue affirmations in the same epistle (E13/E14) make it implausible that he would classify a Decalogue commandment as a matter of indifferent personal opinion. | #1 (adding concept: identifying the "day" as the Sabbath when the text does not); #4b (cross-referencing) | I143 (exists) |
| I5 | The "days" in Galatians 4:10 include the weekly Sabbath, making it a "weak and beggarly element." | I-B | FOR: "Days" could conceivably include any recurring day observance. AGAINST: E18/E417 (text does not name the Sabbath; N10/N132 confirms sabbaton absent); the context addresses circumcision (Gal 5:2; 6:12-13); "months, times, years" align with new moons, feast seasons, sabbatical/jubilee years -- all ceremonial calendar items; E15/E143 (Paul distinguishes ceremony from commandments in 1 Cor 7:19). | The text says "days" without specifying which. Identifying the Sabbath requires adding a referent the text does not state. The context of circumcision controversy locates the discussion in the ceremonial domain. | #1 (adding concept: identifying "days" as the Sabbath when the text does not); #4b (cross-referencing) | I142 (exists) |
| I6 | Col 2:16-17 teaches that ALL sabbaths (including the weekly Sabbath) are shadows fulfilled in Christ and abolished.

The claim adds the concept "all sabbaths are one unified category" when the text repeatedly distinguishes them. | #1 (adding "all sabbaths are one" when the text distinguishes them); #3 (external framework of law-as-single-unit); overrides multiple E/N items | I136 (exists) |
| I7 | Paul's own vocabulary across his epistles establishes two distinct law categories: cessation vocabulary (dogma, cheirographon, dikaiomata sarkos) for what was abolished, and continuation vocabulary (entole unqualified, nomos characterized as holy/just/good/spiritual) for what remains. These vocabulary sets are non-overlapping and distinguish the ceremonial from the moral. | I-A | E1/E054 (Col 2:14 uses dogma for what was nailed); E4/E249 (dogma distribution); E5/E254 (Col 2:20-22 identifies ordinances as "doctrines of men"); E13/E025 (Rom 3:31: "we establish the law"); E14/E010 (Rom 7:7,12,14: law = Decalogue, holy/just/good/spiritual); E15/E143 (1 Cor 7:19: circumcision nothing, commandments everything); E16/E255 (Eph 6:2-3: Decalogue commandment cited as binding in same epistle as Eph 2:15); N1/N098 (authorship distinction); N2/N018 (cessation vocabulary never for Decalogue). | Each E/N item is text-derived. The claim systematizes the vocabulary distribution across Paul's epistles into a comprehensive pattern. No single verse says "Paul recognizes two categories of law vocabulary." | #5 (systematizing) | I048/I056 (exist) |
| I8 | Romans 14:5 teaches that the weekly Sabbath is no longer binding because Paul treats "days" as a matter of individual conscience. | I-D | E11/E499 (Rom 14:5 mentions "one day" without naming the Sabbath). OVERRIDES: E13/E025 (Rom 3:31: Paul establishes the law in the same epistle); E14/E010 (Rom 7:7,12: Paul identifies the Decalogue and calls it holy/just/good); E17/E086 (Sabbath in the Decalogue); N6/N128 (sabbaton absent from the passage); N7/N129 (genre = doubtful disputations). | The passage does not name the Sabbath (N6). Reading the "day" as the Sabbath requires overriding Paul's own Decalogue affirmations in the same epistle (E13, E14) and treating a Decalogue commandment as a "doubtful disputation" (E12). The text's own genre classification (diakriseis dialogismon) excludes settled Decalogue commands. | #1 (adding the Sabbath when the text does not name it); overrides E13, E14, E17, N7 | I150 (new) |

### I-B Resolution: I2 -- Referent of "sabbath days" in Col 2:16

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR ceremonial sabbaths (I2): E6/E486 (OT triad = ceremonial), E7/E492 (Eze 45:17 parallel), E10/E127 (Lev 23:38 millibad separation), N3/N021 (textual distinction), N5/N127 (triad pattern match), N8/N130 (skia = ceremonial system), N9/N131 (Eze 45:17 category/order match)
- FOR weekly Sabbath (I3): E2/E055 (sabbaton has semantic range that includes weekly Sabbath)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E10/E127 (Lev 23:38 millibad) | Plain | Directly addresses the weekly/feast sabbath distinction using an explicit separating preposition in legal prose. |
| E6/E486 (OT ceremonial triad) | Contextually Clear | The triad appears consistently in ceremonial sacrifice contexts across multiple authors and books. Requires pattern recognition across 8 passages. |
| E7/E492 (Eze 45:17) | Contextually Clear | Same categories in same order as Col 2:16, for ceremonial reconciliation. Requires cross-referencing. |
| N3/N021 (millibad separation) | Plain | Follows directly and unavoidably from E10. |
| N8/N130 (skia distribution) | Plain | Observable by word search. Skia is never applied to the Decalogue. |
| E2/E055 (Col 2:16 text) | Ambiguous | The word sabbaton can refer to either weekly or annual sabbaths. The verse itself does not specify. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR ceremonial (I2): Two Plain items (E10/E127, N3/N021), two Contextually Clear items (E6/E486, E7/E492), one additional Plain item (N8/N130). Additional supporting items: E17/E086 (creation grounding of weekly Sabbath, making it a zakar-institution not a skia-institution), E19/E337 (sabbatismos "remaineth"), N1/N098 (cheirographon authorship distinction), N2/N018 (cessation vocabulary never for Decalogue).

FOR weekly (I3): One Ambiguous item (E2/E055 -- sabbaton's semantic range).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements (Lev 23:38 millibad separation, skia distribution pattern) and Contextually Clear statements (OT triad pattern, Eze 45:17 parallel) determine the reading of the Ambiguous item (sabbaton in Col 2:16). The clear interprets the unclear. The OT itself distinguishes weekly sabbaths from ceremonial sabbaths (Lev 23:38), and the Col 2:16 triad matches the OT ceremonial triad, not the weekly Sabbath. The creation grounding (Exo 20:11, zakar memorial backward) further excludes the weekly Sabbath from the "shadow" (skia, pointing forward) category.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong toward I2 (ceremonial sabbaths).**
Plain statements on the ceremonial side (millibad separation, skia distribution), Contextually Clear on the same side (OT triad, Eze 45:17), with only one Ambiguous item on the weekly side (sabbaton's semantic range). Multiple additional E/N items (creation grounding, Decalogue membership, zakar/skia contrast, sabbatismos remaining, cessation vocabulary distribution) all weigh toward the ceremonial reading.

---

### I-B Resolution: I3 -- Do Col 2:16 "sabbath days" include the weekly Sabbath?

This is the inverse of I2. The same analysis applies. I3 has one Ambiguous supporting item (sabbaton's semantic range) against multiple Plain and Contextually Clear items. Resolution: Strong toward ceremonial reading (I2), against the weekly Sabbath reading (I3).

---

### I-B Resolution: I4 -- Does the "day" in Romans 14:5 include the weekly Sabbath?

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR including Sabbath: "One day above another" could conceivably include any day.
- AGAINST: E11/E499 (text does not name the Sabbath), E12/E493 (doubtful disputations genre), E13/E025 (Paul establishes the law), E14/E010 (Paul calls the Decalogue holy/just/good), N6/N128 (sabbaton absent), N7/N129 (genre = disputes about opinions)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E11/E499 (Rom 14:5 text) | Ambiguous | "One day" is unspecified. Could be any day. |
| E12/E493 (doubtful disputations) | Contextually Clear | Rom 14:1 classifies the chapter's subject. Requires awareness of genre. |
| E13/E025 (Rom 3:31) | Plain | Paul directly and emphatically denies making the law void. "God forbid." |
| E14/E010 (Rom 7:7,12) | Plain | Paul directly identifies the Decalogue as holy, just, good. |
| N6/N128 (sabbaton absent) | Plain | Observable absence -- verifiable by word search. |
| N7/N129 (doubtful disputations genre) | Contextually Clear | Follows from E12. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR including Sabbath: One Ambiguous item. AGAINST: Two Plain items (E13, E14), one additional Plain (N6), two Contextually Clear (E12, N7).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
Paul's own affirmations of the moral law in the same epistle (Rom 3:31: "God forbid: yea, we establish the law"; Rom 7:7,12: the law = Decalogue, holy/just/good) determine the reading of the ambiguous Rom 14:5. Paul would not classify a Decalogue commandment as a "doubtful disputation." The clear interprets the unclear.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate toward Continues (day = ceremonial fast/feast, not Sabbath).**
The text does not name the Sabbath. The genre classification ("doubtful disputations") is inconsistent with Decalogue status. Paul's moral law affirmations in the same epistle provide the interpretive framework.

---

### I-B Resolution: I5 -- Do the "days" in Galatians 4:10 include the weekly Sabbath?

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR including Sabbath: "Days" could include any recurring day.
- AGAINST: E18/E417 (text does not name Sabbath), N10/N132 (sabbaton absent), circumcision context (Gal 5:2; 6:12-13), "months/times/years" = ceremonial calendar, E15/E143 (Paul distinguishes ceremony from commandments)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E18/E417 (Gal 4:9-10) | Ambiguous | "Days" is unspecified. |
| Gal 5:2-6; 6:12-13 (circumcision context) | Contextually Clear | The controversy is about circumcision. |
| E15/E143 (1 Cor 7:19) | Plain | Paul distinguishes circumcision (nothing) from commandments (everything). |
| N10/N132 (sabbaton absent) | Plain | Observable absence. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR including Sabbath: One Ambiguous item. AGAINST: One Plain (E15/E143, N10), one Contextually Clear (circumcision context).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The circumcision context of Galatians and Paul's distinction between ceremony and commandments (1 Cor 7:19) determine the reading of the ambiguous "days."

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Moderate toward Continues (days = ceremonial, not Sabbath).**
The text does not name the Sabbath. The context is circumcision. The "months, times, years" align with the ceremonial calendar.

## 4. Verification Phase

**Step A -- Verify explicit statements:**
Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases actual verse text. Each states what the text says, not what a position infers. Verified.

**Step A2 -- Verify positional classifications:**

E13-E14 (Continues): All gates pass. E17 (Continues): All gates pass. E19 (Continues): All gates pass. All other E-items are Neutral (factual observations both sides acknowledge). Verified.

**Step B -- Verify necessary implications:**
N1-N3 (Continues): Gate 0 passed -- all three N-tests verified. N4-N10 (Neutral): Observable grammatical/vocabulary facts both sides accept. Verified.

**Step C -- Verify inference classifications (source test):**
I1 (I-A): All components from E/N tables. Verified. I2 (I-B): E/N on both sides. Verified. I3 (I-B): E/N on both sides. Verified. I4 (I-B): E/N on both sides. Verified. I5 (I-B): E/N on both sides. Verified. I6 (I-D): External framework required, overrides E/N. Verified. I7 (I-A): All components from E/N tables. Verified. I8 (I-D): Overrides E/N statements. Verified.

**Step D -- Verify inference classifications (direction test):**
I1 (I-A): Does not require E/N to mean other than lexical value. I2 (I-B): Requires choosing sabbaton referent. I3 (I-B): Requires E10 to not apply. I4 (I-B): Requires E12 genre to include Decalogue. I5 (I-B): Requires context to include Sabbath. I6 (I-D): Requires overriding E10, E17, E19, N1, N2, N3. I7 (I-A): Systematizes vocabulary pattern. I8 (I-D): Requires overriding E13, E14, E17. Verified.

**Step E -- Consistency checks:**
I1 (I-A): Only requires #5. Check passed. I2 (I-B): E/N on both sides. Check passed. I3 (I-B): E/N on both sides. Check passed. I4 (I-B): E/N on both sides. Check passed. I5 (I-B): E/N on both sides. Check passed. I6 (I-D): Overrides multiple E/N statements. Check passed. I7 (I-A): Only requires #5. Check passed. I8 (I-D): Overrides E/N statements. Check passed.

**Step F -- Verify SIS connections:**
I2 resolution: Lev 23:38 (Plain) -> Col 2:16 (Ambiguous). Connection: shared vocabulary (sabbath), OT precedent (triad pattern in 8 passages). #4a (verified textual connection). I4 resolution: Rom 3:31; 7:7,12 (Plain) -> Rom 14:5 (Ambiguous). Connection: same author, same epistle. #4a. I5 resolution: Gal 5:2; 6:12-13 (Contextually Clear) -> Gal 4:10 (Ambiguous). Connection: same epistle. #4a.

## 7. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

### What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):

- Col 2:14 states that a cheirographon tois dogmasin (hand-written document of ordinances) was nailed to the cross (E1/E054).
- Cheirographon means "hand-written" (cheir + grapho). The Decalogue was written by "the finger of God" (Exo 31:18). These are different categories of authorship (E3/E250, N1/N098).
- Dogma (G1378) appears 5 times in the NT and is never used for the Decalogue (E4/E249, N2/N018).
- Col 2:16 connects (oun, "therefore") the food/drink/feast/new moon/sabbath items to what was nailed in v.14 (N4/N126).
- The heorte-neomenia-sabbaton triad in Col 2:16 matches the OT ceremonial triad found in 8 passages (E6/E486, N5/N127).
- Eze 45:17 uses the same categories in the same order as Col 2:16 for ceremonial reconciliation (E7/E492, N9/N131).
- Skia (G4639) in all three NT theological uses is applied to the ceremonial system, never to the Decalogue or moral law (E2, E8, E9, N8/N130).
- Col 2:20-22 identifies the ordinances as "commandments and doctrines of men" (E5/E254).
- Lev 23:37-38 explicitly separates the "sabbaths of the LORD" from the annual feasts using millibad (E10/E127, N3/N021).
- Rom 14:5 does not name the Sabbath. The word sabbaton does not appear (E11/E499, N6/N128).
- Rom 14:1 classifies the subject as "doubtful disputations" (E12/E493, N7/N129).
- Paul in the same epistle (Romans) affirms the moral law/Decalogue as holy, just, good, spiritual, and established by faith (E13/E025, E14/E010).
- Paul distinguishes ceremonial law (circumcision = nothing) from moral commandments (entole tou theou = binding) (E15/E143).
- The Fourth Commandment uses zakar ("remember") pointing backward to creation (E17/E086).
- Heb 4:9 states that a sabbatismos "remaineth" for the people of God (E19/E337).
- Gal 4:10 does not name the Sabbath. The word sabbaton does not appear (E18/E417, N10/N132).

### What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):

- CANNOT say: "Col 2:16 abolishes the weekly Sabbath." The text does not name the weekly Sabbath. The word sabbaton in the ceremonial triad context is ambiguous, and the OT triad pattern, the Lev 23:38 distinction, and the cheirographon/dogma vocabulary all point to ceremonial sabbaths. This is an I-B inference resolved Strong toward the ceremonial reading.
- CANNOT say: "Rom 14:5 makes the Sabbath optional." The text does not name the Sabbath. The genre is "doubtful disputations." Paul affirms the Decalogue in the same epistle. This is an I-D inference requiring override of E/N statements.
- CANNOT say: "Gal 4:10 calls the Sabbath a weak and beggarly element." The text does not name the Sabbath. The context is circumcision. This is an I-B inference resolved Moderate against the Sabbath identification.
- CANNOT say: "All sabbaths are one unified category abolished at the cross." The text of Lev 23:37-38 explicitly distinguishes weekly sabbaths from feast sabbaths. This is an I-D inference requiring override of multiple E/N statements.
- CANNOT say: "The Sabbath is explicitly named and abolished in any NT passage." No NT passage names the Decalogue Sabbath as abolished.
- CANNOT say: "Col 2:16 is definitely about ONLY ceremonial sabbaths." While the I-B resolution is Strong toward ceremonial, the text does not explicitly state "ceremonial sabbaths only." The identification relies on the OT triad pattern and the Lev 23:38 distinction applied via SIS.
