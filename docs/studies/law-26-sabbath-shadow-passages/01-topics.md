### Nave's Classification Note
Rom 14:1-23 appears under CONSCIENCE and Rom 14:1-6 under COMMANDMENTS OF MEN. This Nave's classification is significant: the passage is categorized under matters of individual conscience and human tradition, not under divine commandments or the Sabbath. The SABBATH topic lists COL 2:16 and HEB 4:4,9 but does NOT list Rom 14:5 -- Nave's does not associate Rom 14:5 with the Sabbath.

### Col 2:16 in Nave's
Col 2:16 appears in the SABBATH topic under "Unclassified Scriptures Relating To." It is listed alongside creation texts, Decalogue texts, prophetic texts, and other Sabbath references without differentiation between weekly and ceremonial sabbaths.
