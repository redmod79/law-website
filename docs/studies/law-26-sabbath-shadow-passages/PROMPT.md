# Bible Study: Do Colossians 2:16-17 and Romans 14:5 Abolish the Weekly Sabbath?

## Question
Do Col 2:16-17 and Rom 14:5 abolish the weekly Sabbath? For Col 2:16-17: Investigate the ceremonial triad ("meat, drink, holyday, new moon, sabbath days"), the skia (shadow) designation, and whether "sabbath days" refers to weekly Sabbath or ceremonial feast sabbaths of Lev 23:37-38. Examine the Greek sabbaton and plural form. Study the immediate context (Col 2:14 -- what was nailed?). Compare the Col 2:16 list with Ezekiel 45:17 where the same categories appear in the same order for making reconciliation. For Rom 14:5: Investigate context (disputable matters), whether "days" refers to Sabbath or fast/feast days, and whether Paul would place a Decalogue commandment in the category of disputable opinion.

## Methodology
Read and apply the methodology in `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-series-methodology.md`. This study is part of the Law of God series and must follow the investigative methodology, evidence classification system (E/N/I with four inference subtypes), classification decision trees, and master evidence file update protocol specified therein.

**Key findings from prior study conclusions relevant to this study:**

1. **law-08 (Abolished at cross):** Col 2:14 uses cheirographon (hand-written) + dogmasin (ordinances). The Decalogue was written by "the finger of God" (Exo 31:18). None of 7 abolition passages names the Decalogue. Dogma (G1378) is never used for the Decalogue. The same author (Paul) uses katargeo to abolish dogma-qualified ordinances (Eph 2:15) while emphatically denying abolishing "the law" (Rom 3:31).

2. **law-24 (Weekly vs ceremonial sabbaths):** The OT ceremonial triad (feasts/new moons/sabbaths) in 2 Chr 31:3, Eze 45:17, Hos 2:11 matches Col 2:16. Lev 23:37-38 explicitly separates "the sabbaths of the LORD" from the feast sabbaths with millibad ("beside/apart from"). The weekly Sabbath is never called moed or chag. Numbers 28-29 places the Sabbath in its own offering category.

3. **law-25 (Sabbath moral or ceremonial):** Seven criteria tested -- creation origin, Decalogue membership, delivery mode, Lev 23 separation, typological function, Heb 4:9 sabbatismos, universal scope. The Sabbath aligns with every moral-law marker and none of the ceremonial markers. Rom 14:5 does not name the Sabbath; the context is "doubtful disputations." Paul would not place a Decalogue commandment in the category of disputable opinion (cf. Rom 3:31; 7:7,12).

4. **law-04 (Ceremonial laws):** Skia (G4639) is applied to the ceremonial system in 3 passages (Heb 10:1; Col 2:17; Heb 8:5) and never to the moral law or Decalogue. Every ceremonial regulation uses the mediated delivery formula ("the LORD spake unto Moses").

5. **law-20/21 (NT Greek law vocabulary):** The vocabulary partition between affirming and abolishing passages: entole (unqualified) = consistently moral commands; dogma = exclusively non-moral (civil decrees or ceremonial ordinances); cheirographon = hand-written (not God-written). The affirm/abolish vocabulary sets are largely non-overlapping.

6. **sabbath-shadow-or-memorial:** The Sabbath uses zakar ("remember") pointing backward to creation. The ceremonial system uses skia ("shadow") pointing forward to Christ. These are opposite directional vectors. The Sabbath fails all 5 shadow criteria: does not point forward, not a copy, not replaced by Christ event, not ceremonial, not temporary.

### Focus Areas
(Derived from tool discoveries -- topics and verses found by Nave's, Strong's, semantic searches, and existing study data)

1. **Colossians 2:14 -- What was nailed to the cross?** The cheirographon (G5498, hand-written) tois dogmasin (G1378, ordinances). Examine the etymology (cheir + grapho = hand-written) vs the Decalogue (written by God's finger). Examine the three possible dative readings of tois dogmasin (instrumental, locative, reference). Examine Col 2:20-22 where Paul identifies the ordinances as "commandments and doctrines of men" (entalmata kai didaskalias ton anthropon). Build on law-08 and law-20/21 findings.

2. **Colossians 2:16 -- The ceremonial triad (heorte/neomenia/sabbaton):** Compare with the OT pattern: 2 Chr 31:3; Eze 45:17; Hos 2:11; 1 Chr 23:31; 2 Chr 2:4; 2 Chr 8:13; Neh 10:33; Isa 1:13-14. In every OT occurrence this triad describes the ceremonial calendar system. Does Col 2:16 use the same pattern? Compare the Ezekiel 45:17 parallel specifically: same categories (burnt offerings, meat offerings, drink offerings, feasts, new moons, sabbaths) in the same order as Col 2:16 (meat, drink, holyday, new moon, sabbath days), both for ceremonial purposes ("to make reconciliation").

3. **Colossians 2:16 -- Greek sabbaton (G4521) and the plural form:** Examine the genitive plural sabbaton. Does the plural form distinguish ceremonial sabbaths from the weekly Sabbath? Examine how sabbaton is used elsewhere in the NT (for both weekly and ceremonial). What determines the referent in Col 2:16 -- the word itself or the context (the triad pattern)?

4. **Colossians 2:17 -- The shadow (skia) designation:** What does skia mean and to what is it applied? Col 2:17 says these items "are a shadow [skia] of things to come; but the body [soma] is of Christ." Compare Heb 10:1 and Heb 8:5 where skia is applied to the ceremonial system. Is the weekly Sabbath a shadow or a memorial? The zakar/skia directional contrast: zakar (remember) points backward to creation; skia (shadow) points forward to Christ.

5. **Romans 14:5 -- Context of "doubtful disputations":** Examine Rom 14:1 (dialogismoi = disputable matters, not settled doctrine). What is the genre of Rom 14? Is it adiaphora (matters of indifference/conscience)? What "days" are in view? Examine the food/day pairing in the context. Would Paul place the Fourth Commandment of the Decalogue -- which he affirms in Rom 3:31; 7:7,12; 8:4 -- in the category of disputable opinion?

6. **Romans 14:5 -- Does the text name the Sabbath?** The text says "one man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike." It does not name the Sabbath. Is it exegetically valid to identify unspecified "days" as the Sabbath when the text does not say so? What are the alternative referents (Jewish fast days, feast days)?

7. **Galatians 4:9-10 -- The "days" parallel:** Paul warns against "ye observe days, and months, and times, and years." The context addresses circumcision (Gal 5:2-6; 6:12-13) and the ceremonial system. The Galatians were formerly Gentile pagans (4:8) who had never observed the Mosaic law. "Again" (palin) = returning to bondage. Does this parallel Rom 14:5? How do the two passages differ?

8. **Paul's consistency across epistles:** In the same epistles where abolition language appears, Paul affirms the moral law: Rom 3:31 (establish the law); Rom 7:7,12 (law = Decalogue, holy/just/good); 1 Cor 7:19 (circumcision nothing, keeping commandments everything); Eph 6:2-3 (5th Decalogue commandment binding in same epistle as Eph 2:15). Can Paul be read as abolishing the Sabbath in Col 2:16 while affirming the Decalogue elsewhere?

9. **The Lev 23:37-38 distinction applied:** How does the millibad separation in Lev 23:38 (feast sabbaths "beside" the sabbaths of the LORD) determine the reading of Col 2:16? The SIS (Scripture Interprets Scripture) principle: plain OT passages govern the reading of ambiguous NT references.

10. **Both sides -- strongest arguments:** Present the strongest Abolished-position arguments (sabbaton can mean weekly Sabbath; Col 2:17 calls them "shadow"; no explicit limitation to ceremonial sabbaths in the text) and the strongest Continues-position arguments (OT triad pattern; cheirographon/dogma context; millibad separation; zakar vs skia directional contrast; Sabbath in the Decalogue). Evaluate each using the SIS methodology and evidence hierarchy.
