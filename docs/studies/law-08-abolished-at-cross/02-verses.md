## PRIMARY ABOLITION PASSAGES

### 1. Colossians 2:1-23 (Full Chapter)

**Col 2:1** For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and [for] them at Laodicea, and [for] as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
**Col 2:2** That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;
**Col 2:3** In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
**Col 2:4** And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
**Col 2:5** For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.
**Col 2:6** As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walk ye in him:
**Col 2:7** Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.

**Col 2:10** And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:
**Col 2:11** In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:

**Col 2:13** And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;
**Col 2:14** Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
**Col 2:15** [And] having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
**Col 2:16** Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath [days]:
**Col 2:17** Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body [is] of Christ.
**Col 2:18** Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

**Col 2:21** (Touch not; taste not; handle not;
**Col 2:22** Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?
**Col 2:23** Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.

### 2. Ephesians 2:1-22 (Full Chapter)

**Eph 2:1** And you [hath he quickened], who were dead in trespasses and sins;
**Eph 2:2** Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
**Eph 2:3** Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
**Eph 2:4** But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
**Eph 2:5** Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
**Eph 2:6** And hath raised [us] up together, and made [us] sit together in heavenly [places] in Christ Jesus:
**Eph 2:7** That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in [his] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
**Eph 2:8** For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God:
**Eph 2:9** Not of works, lest any man should boast.
**Eph 2:10** For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
**Eph 2:11** Wherefore remember, that ye [being] in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;
**Eph 2:12** That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:
**Eph 2:13** But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
**Eph 2:14** For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition [between us];
**Eph 2:15** Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, [even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, [so] making peace;
**Eph 2:16** And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:
**Eph 2:17** And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.
**Eph 2:18** For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
**Eph 2:19** Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;
**Eph 2:20** And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner [stone];
**Eph 2:21** In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:
**Eph 2:22** In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.

- v.14: mesotoichon (G3320) = "middle wall"; phragmou (G5418) = "of partition"
- v.16: stauros (G4716) = "cross"
- Context: vv.11-12 establish the Jew/Gentile divide (Circumcision/Uncircumcision); vv.14-15 identify what created the "middle wall" = "the law of commandments in ordinances"

### 3. Hebrews 7:1-28 (Full Chapter)

**Heb 7:1** For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
**Heb 7:2** To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
**Heb 7:3** Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.
**Heb 7:4** Now consider how great this man [was], unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
**Heb 7:5** And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
**Heb 7:6** But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
**Heb 7:7** And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
**Heb 7:8** And here men that die receive tithes; but there he [receiveth them], of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
**Heb 7:9** And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.
**Heb 7:10** For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
**Heb 7:11** If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
**Heb 7:12** For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
**Heb 7:13** For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.
**Heb 7:14** For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
**Heb 7:15** And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,
**Heb 7:16** Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.
**Heb 7:17** For he testifieth, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
**Heb 7:18** For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
**Heb 7:19** For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did]; by the which we draw nigh unto God.
**Heb 7:20** And inasmuch as not without an oath [he was made priest]:
**Heb 7:21** (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)
**Heb 7:22** By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
**Heb 7:23** And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:
**Heb 7:24** But this [man], because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
**Heb 7:25** Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
**Heb 7:26** For such an high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
**Heb 7:27** Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
**Heb 7:28** For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, [maketh] the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.

**KEY VOCABULARY IN PASSAGE:**
- v.12: metatithemenes (G3346) = "being changed/transferred"; hierosunes (G2420) = "of the priesthood"; nomou (G3551) = "of the law"; metathesis (G3331) = "a change/transfer"
- v.16: nomou (G3551) = "the law"; entoles (G1785) = "commandment"; sarkines (G4559) = "carnal/fleshly"
- v.18: athetesis (G115) = "a disannulling/setting aside"; proagouses (G4254) = "going before/preceding"; entoles (G1785) = "commandment"
- v.28: nomos (G3551) = "the law"
- Context: the entire chapter argues from Melchizedek's superiority to Aaron -> the priesthood must change -> therefore the law governing the priesthood must also change. The "law" in view is the Levitical/priestly law.

### 4. Hebrews 9:1-28 (Full Chapter)

**Heb 9:1** Then verily the first [covenant] had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
**Heb 9:2** For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein [was] the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.
**Heb 9:3** And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;
**Heb 9:4** Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein [was] the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
**Heb 9:5** And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
**Heb 9:6** Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service [of God].
**Heb 9:7** But into the second [went] the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and [for] the errors of the people:
**Heb 9:8** The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:
**Heb 9:9** Which [was] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
**Heb 9:10** [Which stood] only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed [on them] until the time of reformation.
**Heb 9:11** But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
**Heb 9:12** Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption [for us].
[vv.13-28 continue the argument about Christ's superior sacrifice and the heavenly sanctuary]

**KEY VOCABULARY IN PASSAGE:**
- v.1: dikaiomata (G1345, nominative plural) = "ordinances"; latreias (G2999) = "of divine service"
- v.9: parabole (G3850) = "a figure/parable"
- v.10: bromasin (G1033) = "meats/foods"; pomasin (G4188) = "drinks"; baptismois (G909) = "washings"; dikaiomata sarkos (G1345 + G4561) = "carnal ordinances"; diorthoseos (G1357) = "reformation"
- Context: the "ordinances" (dikaiomata) are explicitly identified as "meats and drinks, and divers washings" = ceremonial regulations. "Carnal ordinances" = regulations pertaining to the flesh. "Until the time of reformation" = temporary, imposed until Christ.

### 5. Hebrews 10:1-18 (Key Section)

**Heb 10:1** For the law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
**Heb 10:2** For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.
**Heb 10:3** But in those [sacrifices there is] a remembrance again [made] of sins every year.
**Heb 10:4** For [it is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
**Heb 10:5** Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:
**Heb 10:6** In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
**Heb 10:7** Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
**Heb 10:8** Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and [offering] for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure [therein]; which are offered by the law;
**Heb 10:9** Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
**Heb 10:10** By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once [for all].
**Heb 10:11** And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
**Heb 10:12** But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
**Heb 10:14** For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
**Heb 10:15** [Whereof] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
**Heb 10:16** This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
**Heb 10:17** And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
**Heb 10:18** Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for sin.

**KEY VOCABULARY IN PASSAGE:**
- v.1: skian (G4639) = "shadow"; nomos (G3551) = "the law"; thusiais (G2378) = "sacrifices"
- v.5: thusian (G2378) = "sacrifice"; prosphoran (G4376) = "offering"
- v.8: "which are offered by the law" (kata nomon) = these sacrifices are the content of "the law" in view
- v.9: anairei (G337) = "He taketh away/removes"; proton (G4413) = "the first"; deuteron (G1208) = "the second"; stesei (G2476) = "establish"
- v.16: nomous (G3551, accusative plural) = "my laws"; kardias (G2588) = "hearts"; dianoian (G1271) = "minds"; epigrapso (G1924) = "I will write"
- Context: "the first" that is taken away (v.9) = the sacrificial system ("sacrifice and offering"); "the second" established = God's will fulfilled in Christ. The "law" having a "shadow" (v.1) is the sacrificial/ceremonial law, as identified by the context (sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, blood of bulls and goats). NOTE: v.16 says God will write "my laws" (nomous) in their hearts — the law CONTINUES in the new covenant, written on hearts instead of stone.

### 6. 2 Corinthians 3:1-18 (Full Chapter)

**2 Cor 3:1** Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some [others], epistles of commendation to you, or [letters] of commendation from you?
**2 Cor 3:2** Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:
**2 Cor 3:3** [Forasmuch as ye are] manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
**2 Cor 3:4** And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
**2 Cor 3:5** Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency [is] of God;
**2 Cor 3:6** Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
**2 Cor 3:7** But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away:
**2 Cor 3:8** How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
**2 Cor 3:9** For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
**2 Cor 3:10** For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
**2 Cor 3:11** For if that which is done away [was] glorious, much more that which remaineth [is] glorious.
**2 Cor 3:12** Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
**2 Cor 3:13** And not as Moses, [which] put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:
**2 Cor 3:14** But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which [vail] is done away in Christ.
**2 Cor 3:15** But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.
**2 Cor 3:16** Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
**2 Cor 3:17** Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.
**2 Cor 3:18** But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.

**KEY VOCABULARY IN PASSAGE:**
- v.7: diakonia (G1248) = "ministration"; thanatou (G2288) = "of death"; grammasin (G1121) = "in letters"; entupomene (G1795) = "engraven"; lithois (G3037) = "in stones"; doxe (G1391) = "glory"; katargoumenen (G2673, present passive participle FEMININE) = "being done away" — modifies ten doxan (the glory, feminine), NOT the ministration or the law
- v.11: to katargoumenon (G2673, present passive participle NEUTER) = "that which is done away"; to menon (G3306) = "that which remaineth"
- v.13: to telos tou katargoumenou (G2673, present passive participle GENITIVE NEUTER) = "the end of that which is abolished"
- v.14: katargeitai (G2673) = "is done away" — the vail is done away in Christ

**CRITICAL GRAMMATICAL NOTE (from prior study 2-corinthians-3-ministration):**
In v.7, katargoumenen is FEMININE SINGULAR, agreeing with ten doxan (the glory, feminine), NOT with he diakonia (the ministration, also feminine but in nominative case) or with ho nomos (the law, masculine). The participle modifies THE GLORY of Moses' face that was fading, not the law written on stones. In v.11, to katargoumenon is NEUTER, agreeing with neither diakonia (feminine) nor nomos (masculine) — it refers to the preceding neuter concept (the glory/splendor system). In v.13, tou katargoumenou is GENITIVE NEUTER — "the end of that [neuter thing] being abolished."

### 7. Galatians 3:1-29 (Full Chapter)

**Gal 3:1** O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?
**Gal 3:2** This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
**Gal 3:3** Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?
[vv.4-12 argue that the law cannot justify; righteousness is by faith]
**Gal 3:10** For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.
**Gal 3:11** But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith.
**Gal 3:13** Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that hangeth on a tree:
**Gal 3:14** That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
[vv.15-18 argue that the covenant promise to Abraham cannot be disannulled by the law 430 years later]
**Gal 3:19** Wherefore then [serveth] the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
**Gal 3:24** Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
**Gal 3:25** But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

**KEY VOCABULARY IN PASSAGE:**
- v.10: katara (G2671) = "curse"; biblio tou nomou (G975 + G3551) = "book of the law"
- v.13: exegorasen (G1805, aorist active) = "redeemed/bought out"; kataras tou nomou (G2671 + G3551) = "curse of the law"; katara (G2671) = "a curse"; epikataratos (G1944) = "cursed"
- v.19: nomos (G3551) = "the law"; parabaseon (G3847) = "transgressions"; prosetehe (G4369) = "was added"
- v.24: paidagogos (G3807) = "schoolmaster/guardian/tutor"
- Context: Christ redeemed us FROM THE CURSE of the law (v.13), NOT from the law itself. The "curse" is the penalty pronounced by the law (v.10, citing Deu 27:26). The law was "added because of transgressions" (v.19) — the added law was the ceremonial/sacrificial system that addressed transgressions, "till the seed should come."

### Jeremiah 3:16

**Rom 7:7** What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
**Rom 7:12** Wherefore the law [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
**Rom 7:14** For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.

### Romans 8:3-4
**Rom 8:3** For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
**Rom 8:4** That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

### Romans 10:4
"For Christ [is] the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."

### Hebrews 8:7-13
**Heb 8:7** For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
**Heb 8:10** For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.
**Heb 8:13** In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old [is] ready to vanish away.

### Hebrews 11:40
"God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."

### Hebrews 12:18-19,27
**Heb 12:18** For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
**Heb 12:19** And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which [voice] they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more.
**Heb 12:27** And this [word], Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.

### Galatians 4:30-31
**Gal 4:30** Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
**Gal 4:31** So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
