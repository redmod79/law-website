# Nave's Topical Dictionary Entries — Law 08: What Was Abolished at the Cross?

## ORDINANCE

### Full Entry
- A decree: EXO 12:14,24,43; 13:10; 15:25; NUM 9:14; 10:8; 15:15; 18:8; ISA 24:5; MAL 4:4; ROM 13:2; 1PE 2:13
- INSUFFICIENCY OF, FOR SALVATION: ISA 1:10-17; GAL 5:6; 6:15; EPH 2:15; COL 2:14,20-23; HEB 9:1,8-10
  - See FORM
  - See FORMALISM

### Key Observations
- The INSUFFICIENCY subsection lists the exact passages this study must analyze: Eph 2:15, Col 2:14,20-23, Heb 9:1,8-10
- The "decree" subsection includes both OT ordinances (Exo 12:14,24,43) and NT civil/ecclesiastical use (Rom 13:2; 1Pe 2:13)
- The topic groups ordinances as insufficient for salvation — not as abolished per se, but as unable to save

### TEMPORARY Subsection (CRITICAL for this study)
JER 3:16; DAN 9:27; MAT 5:17-45; LUK 16:16,17; JHN 1:17; 4:20-24; 8:35; ACT 6:14; 10:28; 13:39; 15:1-29; 21:20-25; ROM 3:1,2; 7:1-6; 8:3; 10:4; 2CO 3:7-14; GAL 2:3-9; 4:30,31; EPH 2:15; COL 2:14-23; HEB 8:4-13; 9:8-24; 10:1-18; 11:40; 12:18,19,27

### Key Observations
- Nave's groups all 7 target passages under "TEMPORARY": Eph 2:15, Col 2:14-23, Heb 7 (via 8:4-13; 9:8-24; 10:1-18), 2 Cor 3:7-14, Gal (via 2:3-9; 4:30,31)
- The label "TEMPORARY" is Nave's editorial classification, not a biblical term
- The engraved-on-stone and ark-preservation notes show the Decalogue's unique markers even within the LAW topic

---

## MORAL LAW
- See LAW (redirect only — no independent entry)

### Key Observation
- Nave's does not have a separate MORAL LAW topic, redirecting to the general LAW entry. This is consistent with law-06's finding that no Hebrew or Greek term means exclusively "moral law."

---

## CROSS
- Jesus crucified on: MAT 27:32; MRK 15:21; LUK 23:26; ACT 2:23,36; 4:10; 1CO 1:23; 2:2,8; EPH 2:16; PHP 2:8; COL 1:20; 2:14; HEB 12:2
- Carried by Simon: MAT 27:32; MRK 15:21; LUK 23:26
- Carried by Jesus: JHN 19:17
- FIGURATIVE: MAT 10:38; 16:24; MRK 8:34; 10:21; LUK 9:23; 14:27; 1CO 1:17,18; GAL 5:11; 6:14; PHP 3:18

### Key Observations
- Col 2:14 and Eph 2:16 are both listed under CROSS — the cross is the locus of the abolition event
- The topic treats the cross both literally (crucifixion) and figuratively (self-denial)

## PRIEST

### Key Sections for This Study
- BEFORE MOSES: Melchizedek (GEN 14:18; HEB 5:6,10,11; 6:20; 7:1-21)
- THE TIME OF MOSES: EXO 28:1-4; 29:9,44; NUM 3:10; 18:7; 1CH 23:13
- Hereditary descent of office: EXO 27:21; 28:43; 29:9
- DUTIES: To offer sacrifices, pronounce benedictions, teach the law, maintain the sacred fire
- HIGH PRIEST: Title appears after institution (LEV 21:10-15; NUM 3:32); duties include Day of Atonement, judicial function, charge of sanctuary and altar

### Key Observations
- Heb 7:12 says "the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law" — the PRIEST topic provides the background for which priesthood is in view (Levitical/Aaronic)
- The Melchizedek connection (HEB 5:6,10,11; 6:20; 7:1-21) is the basis for the priesthood "change" in Heb 7:12

## CIRCUMCISION
- Institution: GEN 17:10-14; LEV 12:3; JHN 7:22; ACT 7:8; ROM 4:11
- Abrogated: ACT 15:5-29; ROM 3:30; 4:9-11; 1CO 7:18,19; GAL 2:3,4; 5:2-11; 6:12; EPH 2:11,15; COL 2:11; 3:11
- Necessity falsely taught by Judaizing Christians: ACT 15:1
- Characterized by Paul as a yoke: ACT 15:10

### Key Observations
- Eph 2:11,15 appears under CIRCUMCISION's "Abrogated" subsection — confirming the Eph 2:15 context involves the Jew/Gentile division created by circumcision and ceremonial law
- Col 2:11 also appears here — the "circumcision made without hands" in the same context as Col 2:14

---

## LEGISLATION
- Class, forbidden: EXO 12:49; LEV 24:22; NUM 9:14; 15:15,29; GAL 3:28
- Supplemental, concerning Sabbath-breaking: NUM 15:32-35
- Inheritance: NUM 27:1-11
- See GOVERNMENT; See LAW

### Key Observations
- Brief entry; the GAL 3:28 reference is relevant to the Eph 2:15 "one new man" theme
- The Sabbath-breaking legislation (NUM 15:32-35) is noted as "supplemental" — added after the original Sinai giving
