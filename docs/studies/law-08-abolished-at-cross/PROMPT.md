# Bible Study: What Was Abolished at the Cross?

## Question
Which specific laws were abolished at the cross and which remain? Investigate every New Testament passage that describes something as nailed, abolished, done away, or changed: Colossians 2:14-17, Ephesians 2:15, Hebrews 7:12, Hebrews 9:10, Hebrews 10:1-9, 2 Corinthians 3:7-11, Galatians 3:13. For each passage, determine precisely what is identified as abolished/nailed/changed using the Greek vocabulary in that text (dogma vs. entole vs. nomos, cheirographon, katargeo). Do the passages identify the same thing being abolished, or different things? Does any passage explicitly identify the Ten Commandments / Decalogue / moral law as abolished?

### Prior Study Conclusions (MUST READ)
The research agent MUST read these conclusions from prior studies in this series, as they contain established findings that inform this study:

| Study | Path | Key Established Findings |
|-------|------|--------------------------|
| law-01: God's Moral Law | `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-01-gods-moral-law/CONCLUSION.md` | 46 E-items Continues, 0 Abolished; Decalogue has 7 unique markers; dogma is never used for the moral law; the law is holy/just/good/spiritual; E53-E54 show dogma was nailed, not the Decalogue |
| law-02: Law Before Sinai | `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-02-law-before-sinai/CONCLUSION.md` | Moral law operated before Sinai; 6 categories of pre-Sinai evidence; Gen 26:5 vocabulary (mitsvah, choq, torah); Sabbath at creation |
| law-03: Exodus 20 vs. Later Laws | `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-03-exodus-20-vs-later-laws/CONCLUSION.md` | 5 dimensions of distinction (delivery mode, authorship, repository, naming, boundary marker); multi-author consistency across centuries |
| law-04: Ceremonial Laws | `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-04-ceremonial-laws/CONCLUSION.md` | 5 categories of ceremonial law; shadow/type vocabulary exclusively ceremonial; cheirographon = hand-written (Decalogue = God-written); 1 Cor 7:19 distinguishes entole from circumcision; comprehensive contrast table |
| law-05: Civil/Judicial Laws | `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-05-civil-judicial-laws/CONCLUSION.md` | Mishpatim as case-law applications of Decalogue; civil-ceremonial overlap but separable; NT transfers judicial function; threefold division is I-C (compatible external) |
| law-06: Hebrew Law Vocabulary | `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-06-hebrew-law-vocabulary/CONCLUSION.md` | Hebrew terms describe formal character not moral category; no term exclusively means "moral law"; eduth has unique Decalogue association; LXX compression loses Hebrew precision |
| law-07: Law of Moses | `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-07-law-of-moses/CONCLUSION.md` | "Law of Moses" is comprehensive (all categories); interchangeable with "law of God"/"law of the LORD"; Paul's "law of God" in Rom 7 = Decalogue specifically; comprehensive label does not prove no internal distinction |

### Focus Areas

These focus areas are derived from tool-discovered data (not training knowledge):

1. **Passage-by-passage abolition analysis**: Each of the 7 NT passages (Col 2:14-17, Eph 2:15, Heb 7:12, Heb 9:10, Heb 10:1-9, 2 Cor 3:7-11, Gal 3:13) must be analyzed to determine precisely WHAT each passage identifies as abolished/nailed/changed. The tool discoveries show that different Greek vocabulary is used in different passages — this may indicate different things being abolished.

2. **Greek vocabulary mapping**: The Nave's ORDINANCE topic reveals that dogma/dogmatizo vocabulary (G1378, G1379) appears in Col 2:14,20 and Eph 2:15. The Nave's LAW TEMPORARY subsection includes all 7 target passages. The research agent must determine: Does each passage use dogma (ordinance/decree), entole (commandment), nomos (law), or other vocabulary? What does each vocabulary choice identify as the thing abolished?

3. **Cheirographon identification**: [G5498](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5498/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (cheirographon) is a hapax legomenon — it appears only in Col 2:14. Prior study law-04 established that cheirographon = "hand-written" and the Decalogue was God-written (on stone). The research agent must investigate what "the handwriting of ordinances" refers to — is it a certificate of debt, the Mosaic law code, or the moral law?

4. **Katargeo usage pattern**: [G2673](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2673/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (katargeo) is the primary "done away" / "abolished" word in 2 Cor 3:7,11,13,14 and Eph 2:15. The research agent must look up this Strong's number directly (it was not returned by semantic search) and trace every NT occurrence to determine what is consistently described as katargeo'd.

5. **Priesthood-law connection**: Heb 7:12 (from Nave's LAW TEMPORARY subsection) says "the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law." Which law? The tool-discovered connection to the PRIEST topic suggests this is about Levitical/priestly law specifically. The research agent must investigate the context of Heb 7-10.

6. **Shadow/type identification**: Heb 9:1,8-10 (from Nave's ORDINANCE topic) describes "carnal ordinances" (dikaioma, G1345) imposed "until the time of reformation." Heb 10:1 says "the law having a shadow of good things to come." Prior study law-04 established that shadow/type vocabulary is exclusively ceremonial. The research agent must verify whether these Hebrews passages identify the shadow as the whole law or a specific part.

7. **Galatians 3:13 curse analysis**: [G1805](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1805/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (exagorazo) and [G1944](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1944/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (epikataratos) appear in this verse. "Redeemed from the curse of the law" — what is the "curse"? Is it the law itself that is abolished, or the curse/penalty that the law pronounces? The research agent must examine the Galatians 3 context carefully.

8. **Cross-reference with Nave's LAW TEMPORARY verses**: The LAW topic's TEMPORARY subsection contains many verses beyond the 7 target passages (e.g., Rom 7:1-6; 10:4; Gal 4:30,31; Heb 8:4-13). The research agent should retrieve these additional verses to see if they add clarity to what was abolished.

### Special Research Agent Instructions for This Study

- **For each of the 7 abolition passages**, create a structured entry that includes: (a) the Greek vocabulary used for the thing abolished, (b) the Greek vocabulary used for the act of abolition, (c) contextual clues about what is being abolished, (d) whether the passage explicitly names the Decalogue / Ten Commandments / moral law as the thing abolished.
- **Trace katargeo (G2673) exhaustively** — this word is the key "done away" term. Every NT occurrence should be documented with what is being done away in each case.
- **Compare vocabulary across passages** — note where dogma appears vs. entole vs. nomos vs. dikaioma. The vocabulary choices may reveal that different passages are discussing different laws being abolished.
- **Retrieve Heb 7-10 as a connected argument** — these chapters form a sustained argument about priesthood and law change. Retrieve enough context to see the full flow.
