# Existing Studies Summary

## Directly Relevant Prior Studies

### 1. law-06-hebrew-law-vocabulary (CRITICAL -- OT companion)
- Analyzed: torah, mitsvah, choq, mishpat, edut, piqqud, chuqqah
- Key finding: Hebrew law terms describe formal character (instruction, command, decree, judgment, testimony) not moral categories. No Hebrew term means exclusively "moral law" or "ceremonial law."
- N032: LXX translators maintained torah->nomos and mitsvah->entole as stable mappings but compressed other Hebrew terms
- E218: Torah maps to nomos 188 times; mitsvah maps to entole 153 times
- E220: Dikaioma is the LXX catch-all for seven different Hebrew terms
- I038: Paul's nomos/entole distinction in Rom 7:7-12 maps to torah/mitsvah via LXX
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-06-hebrew-law-vocabulary/CONCLUSION.md

### 2. nt-commandments-vs-ordinances (CRITICAL -- directly overlapping)
- Key finding: NT authors use entole for God's moral commands and dogma for ceremonial regulations
- Dogma NEVER used for God's moral commandments
- Entole: 71 NT occurrences; consistently for moral commands
- Dogma: 5 NT occurrences; Caesar's decree, apostolic council, abolished ordinances
- Eph 2:15 narrowing: ton nomon -> ton entolon -> en dogmasin
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/nt-commandments-vs-ordinances/CONCLUSION.md

### 3. law-08-abolished-at-cross (CRITICAL)
- Analyzed all seven NT abolition passages and their Greek vocabulary
- Key finding: Each abolition passage identifies its referent through specific Greek vocabulary; none names the Decalogue
- E1/E054: Col 2:14 uses cheirographon tois dogmasin
- E2/E053: Eph 2:15 uses ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin
- E31/E250: Cheirographon = hand-written; Decalogue = God-written
- N1/N018: Dogma never used for the Decalogue
- I2: Dogma/cheirographon = cessation vocabulary; entole/nomos = moral vocabulary
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-08-abolished-at-cross/CONCLUSION.md

### 4. law-16-paul-and-law-in-romans (HIGHLY relevant)
- 74 uses of nomos in Romans
- N080: Paul uses nomos in at least four distinct senses
- E403/E026: Rom 8:4 -- singular dikaioma with article = unified moral standard
- E407: Rom 13:9 -- Decalogue commands as content love fulfills
- Articular ho nomos = specific Mosaic law; anarthrous nomos = law as principle
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-16-paul-and-law-in-romans/CONCLUSION.md

### 5. law-17-paul-and-law-in-galatians (RELEVANT)
- 32 occurrences of nomos in Galatians
- Same four semantic ranges as Romans
- "Law of Christ" (Gal 6:2) as distinct usage
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-17-paul-and-law-in-galatians/CONCLUSION.md

### 6. law-04-ceremonial-laws (RELEVANT)
- Established ceremonial vocabulary: dogma in Eph 2:15/Col 2:14, dikaioma in Heb 9:1,10, skia in Heb 10:1/Col 2:17
- Comprehensive Contrast Table: Decalogue vs. Ceremonial Law
- NT consistently uses specific vocabulary for abolished items
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-04-ceremonial-laws/CONCLUSION.md

### 7. law-07-law-of-moses (RELEVANT)
- All 21 "law of Moses" occurrences
- Word study on dikaioma (G1345) -- all 10 NT occurrences
- Vocabulary distribution: nomos, entole, dogma, dikaioma mapped to "Law of Moses" vs. "Law of God"
- Path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-07-law-of-moses/CONCLUSION.md

### 8. law-01-gods-moral-law (RELEVANT)
- Foundation word studies on [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} entole, [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} dogma, [G1345](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1345/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} dikaioma, [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} nomos

## Master Evidence Items Already Established

### E-items (Empirical)

### N-items (Negative/Absence)
- N018: Dogma never used for Decalogue

- N047: Paul uses katargeo both to abolish (Eph 2:15) and deny abolishing (Rom 3:31)
- N080: Paul uses nomos in at least four distinct senses

### I-items (Inferential)
- I033: Hebrew distribution patterns implicitly support moral/ceremonial taxonomy
- I036: Absence of dedicated vocabulary labels proves no distinction exists (counter-argument)
- I038: Paul's nomos/entole in Rom 7 maps to torah/mitsvah via LXX
- I046: "2 Cor 3:7-13 abolishes the Decalogue" -- resolved Strong toward Continues
