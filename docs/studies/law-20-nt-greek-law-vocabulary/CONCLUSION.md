# CONCLUSION: law-20 — NT Greek Law Vocabulary

## Study Question
What do entole, nomos, dogma, cheirographon, and dikaioma reveal about law categories in the NT? Does the Greek vocabulary itself encode or support a moral/ceremonial distinction?

## Summary Answer
The NT Greek vocabulary consistently distinguishes moral commands from ceremonial regulations: entole (G1785) without a qualifier is used exclusively for God's moral commandments (including Decalogue content) across every NT author, while dogma (G1378) is never used for God's moral law — all five of its occurrences refer to civil decrees or abolished ceremonial material. Cheirographon (G5498, "hand-written") in Colossians 2:14 is paired with dogmasin and cannot refer to the Decalogue, which was written by "the finger of God"; and dikaioma (G1345) appears in singular-articular form ("THE righteous requirement of THE law") when referring to the moral standard of the law (Rom 8:4), but in plural form with modifiers (sarkos, latreias) when referring to abolished ceremonial ordinances (Heb 9:1, 10). The Greek vocabulary thus supports, though does not explicitly theorize, a moral/ceremonial distinction: the NT abolition passages (Col 2:14; Eph 2:15) use exclusively ceremonial vocabulary, while passages calling believers to keep commandments use unqualified entole pointing to Decalogue content.

## Key Verses

**Matthew 19:17-19** -- Keeping entole = Decalogue listed
> "And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."

**Romans 7:12** -- Entole (the 10th commandment, v.7) called holy, just, and good

**Ephesians 2:15** -- What was abolished: the law of commandments IN ordinances (dogmasin)
> "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace."

**Colossians 2:14** -- Cheirographon ("hand-written") of ordinances nailed to the cross
> "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross."

**Romans 8:4** -- Dikaioma singular-articular: THE righteousness of THE law fulfilled in believers
> "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."

**Revelation 14:12** -- End-time saints keep entole (unqualified) of God
> "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."

**1 John 5:3** -- Keeping entole = love of God; commandments not grievous
> "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous."

### Positional Classification of E-items (Tree 3 Applied)

**Continues items (E1-E6, E9-E10, E19, E23-E27, E29-E30, E32):**

- E1-E6, E10: Entole used for Decalogue content or moral commands without qualifier. Gate 1: referent identified by context (Decalogue listed or specific command cited). Gate 2: grammar unambiguous (entole = commandment). Gate 3: didactic. Gate 4: consistent with all E-items using entole for moral commands. Classification: CONTINUES.

- E9 (Eph 2:15): The text uses cessation vocabulary ("abolished") but identifies the abolished item as "the law of commandments IN ORDINANCES [en dogmasin]." Gate 1: referent narrowed to the dogma portion. This is consistent with the Continues position: what was abolished was the dogma-expressed portion, not entole generically. Classification: CONTINUES (the verse itself distinguishes within the law).

- E19 (Rom 8:4): "THE righteousness of THE law fulfilled in us" — singular dikaioma with double article = the moral law's requirement actively fulfilled. Gate 1: "the law" in context links to Rom 7:7 (Decalogue). Gate 2: grammar clear. Gate 3: didactic. Gate 4: consistent. Classification: CONTINUES.

- E23-E27: End-time saints and believers keep "commandments [entole] of God." Gate 1: entole unqualified = moral commands (no ceremonial qualifier). Gate 2: grammar clear. Gate 3: E23-E25 are in Revelation (apocalyptic genre), but the statements about commandment-keeping are direct speech, not symbolic vision. Gate 4: consistent. Classification: CONTINUES.

- E29 (Rom 3:31): "We establish the law." Gate 1: nomos is anarthrous but Paul's context is discussing the relationship of faith to law generically. The referent could be the Mosaic code or law-as-principle. However, Paul's strongest denial formula (me genoito) rejects the notion that faith voids law. This is continuation vocabulary. Gate 2: grammar clear. Gate 3: didactic. Gate 4: consistent with Rom 7:12,14. Classification: CONTINUES.

- E30 (Rom 7:7): Paul identifies "the law" as the Decalogue by direct quotation. Continuation vocabulary: the law reveals sin and is identified as the moral standard. Classification: CONTINUES.

- E32 (Jas 2:8-12): "Royal law" and "law of liberty" identified with Decalogue content. Classification: CONTINUES.

**Neutral items (E7-E8, E11-E18, E20-E22, E28, E31):**

- E7-E8: Entole in Heb 7:16,18 refers to Levitical succession law with qualifier "sarkines." Both sides agree this is ceremonial. Classification: NEUTRAL.

- E11-E15: Dogma distribution data — observable vocabulary facts both sides accept. Classification: NEUTRAL.

- E16-E18: Lexical/compositional facts about cheirographon, God's writing, and Moses's writing. Observable data. Classification: NEUTRAL.

- E20-E21: Dikaioma in Heb 9:1,10 — ceremonial ordinances both sides agree ceased. Classification: NEUTRAL.

- E22: Luke 1:6 lists two categories — observable textual fact. Classification: NEUTRAL.

- E28: Col 2:20-22 identifies dogmatizo regulations as dietary/purity — observable fact. Classification: NEUTRAL.

- E31: Rom 4:15 article pattern — grammatical observation. Classification: NEUTRAL.

## Necessary Implications (N)

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable | Position |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | Entole (G1785) without a qualifier is never used in the NT for a ceremonial regulation that was abolished. Every ceremonial/cessation use of entole carries a qualifier (sarkines, en dogmasin, or contextual identification). | E1-E6, E7-E10, E23-E27 | The data set of all NT entole occurrences shows unqualified entole = moral commands; every ceremonial use has a modifier. No reader can dispute the presence or absence of qualifiers. | Continues |
| N2 | Dogma (G1378) is never used for God's moral commandments in any NT passage. All 5 occurrences are civil decrees (Luke 2:1; Acts 17:7), ecclesiastical decisions (Acts 16:4), or abolished ceremonial material (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14). | E11-E15 | This is a complete enumeration of all 5 occurrences. The distribution is verifiable and undisputed. | Continues |
| N3 | Cheirographon (G5498), meaning "hand-written" (cheir + grapho), denotes a document of human authorship. The Decalogue was "written with the finger of God" (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10). These are different categories of authorship. | E16, E17 | "Hand-written" and "written with the finger of God" are different writing agents by lexical definition. | Continues |
| N4 | In Rom 8:4, dikaioma is singular and articular ("THE righteous requirement of THE law"); in Heb 9:1,10, dikaioma is plural and modified by latreia/sarkos ("ordinances of divine service" / "carnal ordinances"). The grammatical form differs between these law-referent contexts. | E19, E20, E21 | The number (singular vs. plural), article (present vs. absent), and modifiers (tou nomou vs. sarkos/latreias) are observable grammatical facts. | Neutral |
| N5 | Luke 1:6 lists entolai (commandments) and dikaiomata (ordinances) as two distinct categories of obedience to God, coordinated by kai ("and") under one Lord. | E22 | The conjunction kai coordinates two different nouns as separate items in a list. Both sides can observe this textual structure. | Neutral |
| N6 | Paul distinguishes entole (commandments of God) from circumcision (ceremonial rite) in 1 Cor 7:19: circumcision is "nothing" but keeping entole matters. | E5 | Paul sets up an explicit contrast: peritome = nothing; teresis entolon Theou = what matters. The distinction is in Paul's own text. | Continues |
| N7 | The Eph 2:15 construction narrows progressively: ton nomon (the law) -> ton entolon (of the commandments) -> en dogmasin (in ordinances). Each phrase limits the preceding one. | E9, E14 | This is a grammatical parsing of the Greek construction. The narrowing structure is observable in the case endings and prepositional phrase. | Neutral |
| N8 | Col 2:20-22 identifies the content of what "dogmatizo" (G1379) regulates as "Touch not; taste not; handle not" — dietary/purity regulations described as "commandments and doctrines of men." | E15, E28 | Paul's own text identifies the referent of dogmatizo in the immediately following verses. Both sides can read this. | Neutral |
| N9 | Paul uses nomos in at least four distinct senses: (1) Torah/code, (2) Decalogue specifically (when quoting content), (3) operating principle, (4) Pentateuch as Scripture-witness. | E29, E30, E31 and broader Pauline corpus | This is a lexical observation from the distribution of nomos in context. The word has different referents in different passages, which any reader can verify. | Neutral |

### N-tier Verification (Gate 0)

Each N-item was tested against the three N-tier tests:

- **N1:** Universal agreement test — would an Abolished scholar agree that entole without qualifier = moral commands and ceremonial uses have qualifiers? YES, the distribution data is verifiable. No interpretation required — this is pattern observation. Zero added concepts. PASS.

- **N2:** Same test for dogma. Complete enumeration of 5 occurrences — no selection bias possible. PASS.

- **N3:** "Hand-written" vs. "written by God's finger" = different authors. This is lexical meaning. Universal agreement on the lexical difference. PASS.

- **N4:** Singular/articular vs. plural/anarthrous = grammatical observation. Both sides can verify the parsing. PASS.

- **N5:** Two nouns coordinated by kai = two categories listed. Grammatical observation. PASS.

- **N6:** Paul's own contrast between circumcision and entole. The text itself sets up the distinction. PASS.

- **N7:** Grammatical parsing of Eph 2:15 — case endings and prepositional structure. PASS.

- **N8:** Paul's own identification of what dogmatizo regulates. The text supplies the referent. PASS.

- **N9:** Nomos has different referents in different passages — observable from quotation context. PASS.

## Inferences (I)

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | The NT Greek vocabulary encodes a systematic moral/ceremonial distinction: entole = moral commands, dogma = ceremonial ordinances, cheirographon = ceremonial law code, dikaioma singular = moral standard, dikaioma plural = ceremonial regulations. | I-A | E1-E6 (entole = Decalogue); E11-E15 (dogma distribution); E16-E17 (cheirographon authorship); E19-E21 (dikaioma patterns); N1 (entole qualifier pattern); N2 (dogma never moral). | All components are in the E/N tables. This is an inference because it systematizes the individual observations into a comprehensive vocabulary taxonomy. The text provides the data points; the "system" is the reader's synthesis. | #5 (systematizing) |
| I2 | Since dogma and cheirographon are exclusively used for non-moral regulations, and entole (unqualified) is exclusively used for moral commands, the NT abolition passages (Col 2:14; Eph 2:15) abolish only ceremonial law, not the Decalogue. | I-A | N1 (entole unqualified = moral); N2 (dogma never moral); N3 (cheirographon = hand-written); E9 (Eph 2:15 narrowing); E15 (Col 2:14 uses dogma). | Systematizes the vocabulary patterns into a specific doctrinal conclusion about which law was abolished. All components from E/N tables. | #5 (systematizing) |
| I3 | All NT law is a single undifferentiated unit. The vocabulary differences (entole, dogma, nomos) are stylistic variation, not categorical distinction. Therefore, abolishing any portion abolishes the whole, including the Decalogue. | I-D | N1 states entole unqualified = moral commands with no exceptions; N2 states dogma = never moral; E5 (1 Cor 7:19) distinguishes entole from circumcision; E9 (Eph 2:15) narrows what was abolished using en dogmasin. | Requires overriding N1, N2, N6, and N7 (all showing vocabulary distinctions exist). The claim that the vocabulary differences are "stylistic" adds a concept the text does not state and contradicts the observed distribution patterns. | #1 (adding a concept the text does not state), #3 (external framework of indivisible law) |
| I4 | Cheirographon in Col 2:14 refers to the Decalogue — the Ten Commandments were nailed to the cross. | I-D | E16 states cheirographon = "hand-written" (cheir + grapho). E17 states the Decalogue was "written with the finger of God" (Exo 31:18). N3 states these are different categories of authorship. E15 states cheirographon is paired with tois dogmasin (ordinances). N2 states dogma is never used for the Decalogue. | Requires overriding N3 (different authorship), N2 (dogma never moral), and the lexical meaning of cheir-graphon ("hand-written" = not God-written). | #1 (redefining cheirographon against its etymology), #3 (external framework) |
| I5 | Cheirographon in Col 2:14 refers to a metaphorical debt certificate — a record of sins/guilt — not to any law code at all. Therefore Col 2:14 does not address the moral/ceremonial distinction. | I-C | E16 states cheirographon = "hand-written document." Col 2:14 says it was "against us, contrary to us." Greco-Roman papyri use cheirographon for debt certificates. | The Greco-Roman papyri background is external to the biblical text. The reading does not contradict any E/N statement (a debt record is still hand-written, not God-written), but it adds historical context the text itself does not state. | #3 (external historical framework) |
| I6 | Paul's articular/anarthrous nomos pattern signals a theological distinction between "the specific Mosaic code" (articular) and "law as principle" (anarthrous). | I-B | E30 (Rom 7:7: articular ho nomos = Decalogue by quotation); E31 (Rom 4:15: articular then anarthrous in same verse); E29 (Rom 3:31: anarthrous nomon both times). N9 (nomos has four senses). | Some E/N support the pattern (E30, E31), but E29 uses anarthrous nomos for the law Paul emphatically establishes — which should be the specific Mosaic code, not a generic principle. Greek grammar norms govern article usage by definiteness rules, not solely by theological categories. | #2 (choosing between grammatical and theological explanation for article usage) |
| I7 | Dikaioma's singular/plural pattern is an absolute code: singular always = moral law, plural always = ceremonial. | I-B | E19 (Rom 8:4: singular = moral standard); E20-E21 (Heb 9:1,10: plural = ceremonial). But Rev 15:4 uses plural dikaiomata for God's righteous judgments (not ceremonial), and Rev 19:8 uses plural dikaiomata for saints' righteous deeds (not ceremonial). | The pattern holds within law-referent contexts but breaks down in non-law contexts. Claiming an "absolute code" requires ignoring Rev 15:4 and 19:8, which use plural dikaiomata for non-ceremonial referents. | #1 (adding "absolute code" concept), #2 (choosing to ignore counter-examples) |
| I8 | The Greek vocabulary proves the moral/ceremonial distinction was divinely intended by the NT authors as a deliberate categorical system. | I-C | E1-E32 and N1-N9 document the vocabulary distribution. The pattern exists. | The distribution data is in the E/N tables, but "divinely intended" and "deliberate categorical system" add authorial-intent claims the text does not make about its own vocabulary. The text uses the vocabulary; it does not state why. | #3 (external framework of authorial intent) |

## I-B Resolutions

### I-B Resolution: I6 — Articular/anarthrous nomos as theological signal

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR (the pattern signals theological distinction): E30 (Rom 7:7: articular ho nomos identified as Decalogue by quotation), E31 (Rom 4:15: articular = specific law, anarthrous = generic concept in same verse)
- AGAINST (the pattern is grammatical, not theological): E29 (Rom 3:31: anarthrous nomon used for the law Paul emphatically establishes — this should be the specific Mosaic code if the pattern held), N9 (nomos has four senses regardless of article)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| E30 | Plain | Paul directly quotes the 10th commandment to identify "the law" |
| E31 | Contextually Clear | Article shift visible in one verse; requires awareness of Greek grammar |
| E29 | Contextually Clear | Anarthrous nomon in a passage about the specific law — complicates the rule |
| N9 | Plain | Observable from multiple passages that nomos has different senses |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
Both sides have Contextually Clear items. The pattern exists (E30, E31 support it) but has exceptions (E29 undermines it as an absolute rule). N9 confirms nomos has multiple senses but does not resolve whether the article signals the distinction.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
E30 (Plain: Paul identifies articular ho nomos as Decalogue) demonstrates one instance where the articular form points to a specific known law. E29 (anarthrous nomon = the law Paul establishes) shows the anarthrous form can also refer to a specific, valued law. The clear passage (E30) establishes that articular nomos CAN signal the Decalogue, but E29 shows anarthrous nomos CAN ALSO refer to the law-as-code.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Moderate**
The article pattern is a tendency, not an absolute rule. Articular nomos tends toward specific-known-referent; anarthrous nomos can shift toward qualitative/generic. But exceptions exist, and Greek grammar norms (not theology alone) govern article usage. The pattern has limited diagnostic value when used in isolation; context remains the primary disambiguator.

**Direction:** Neutral — the article pattern is a grammatical observation that supports but does not prove either position.

---

### I-B Resolution: I7 — Dikaioma singular/plural as absolute code

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR (absolute code): E19 (Rom 8:4: singular = moral); E20-E21 (Heb 9:1,10: plural = ceremonial)
- AGAINST (not absolute): Rev 15:4 (plural dikaiomata = God's righteous judgments, not ceremonial); Rev 19:8 (plural dikaiomata = saints' righteous deeds, not ceremonial)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| E19 | Plain | Singular with double article in a passage directly about moral law |
| E20-E21 | Plain | Plural with sarkos/latreias modifiers in an explicitly ceremonial context |
| Rev 15:4 | Plain | Plural dikaiomata clearly means "righteous judgments" (not ceremonial) |
| Rev 19:8 | Plain | Plural dikaiomata clearly means "righteous deeds" (not ceremonial) |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
Plain statements on both sides. The singular/plural pattern holds within law-referent contexts (Rom 8:4 vs. Heb 9:1,10) but not as an absolute code across all contexts (Rev 15:4; 19:8).

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
Rev 15:4 and 19:8 are clear: plural dikaiomata can mean righteous deeds/judgments, not only ceremonial ordinances. The pattern is contextual, not absolute.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Strong — against the "absolute code" claim**
The singular/plural distinction is a contextual pattern within law-referent passages, not a universal code. Within passages discussing law (Rom 8:4 vs. Heb 9:1,10), the pattern holds with the help of modifiers. Outside law passages, the plural has non-ceremonial meanings.

**Direction:** Neutral — the pattern is a grammatical observation, not an absolute code. The qualified version (within law-referent contexts, with modifiers) is I-A Continues; the unqualified "absolute code" claim fails.

- I1, I2 (I-A): Only require #5 (systematizing). Confirmed.
- I6 (I-B): E/N items on BOTH sides. Confirmed.
- I7 (I-B): E/N items on BOTH sides. Confirmed.
- I3, I4 (I-D): Override N1, N2, N3, N6. Confirmed.
- I5, I8 (I-C): Override nothing. Confirmed.

### Step F: SIS connections
- I6 resolution documents SIS between E30 (clear: articular ho nomos = Decalogue) and E29 (anarthrous nomon = established law).
- I7 resolution documents SIS between E19-E21 (law-context pattern) and Rev 15:4, 19:8 (non-law context).

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies)

1. Entole (G1785) without a qualifier is consistently used for God's moral commands across all NT authors (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, author of Hebrews, author of Revelation). When entole appears in a ceremonial context, a qualifier is present (sarkines, en dogmasin, contextual identification).

2. Dogma (G1378) is never used for God's moral commandments in any NT passage. All 5 occurrences are civil decrees or abolished ceremonial material.

3. Cheirographon (G5498) means "hand-written" (cheir + grapho). The Decalogue was written by "the finger of God" (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10). These are different categories of authorship.

4. In Rom 8:4, dikaioma appears as singular with article (to dikaioma tou nomou = THE righteous requirement of THE law), connected to the Decalogue identified in Rom 7:7. In Heb 9:1,10, dikaiomata appears as plural with sarkos/latreias modifiers in a ceremonial context with temporal limitation.

5. Paul explicitly distinguishes "the commandments [entole] of God" from circumcision (ceremonial) in 1 Cor 7:19.

6. The Eph 2:15 construction narrows what was abolished: the law -> of the commandments -> in ordinances (en dogmasin). The narrowing qualifier identifies the abolished portion.

7. NT authors use entole for what continues and dogma for what was abolished. This vocabulary distinction is maintained throughout the NT.

8. Paul uses nomos in at least four distinct senses; context determines which sense is operative. The articular/anarthrous pattern shows a general tendency but is not an absolute rule.

## What CANNOT Be Said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture)

1. It cannot be said that the Greek vocabulary was "deliberately designed" as a categorical system by NT authors. The distribution pattern exists, but no NT author states that entole means "moral" and dogma means "ceremonial" as a terminological definition.

2. It cannot be said that nomos (articular vs. anarthrous) creates an absolute theological distinction between "the Mosaic code" and "law as principle." The tendency exists but Greek grammar norms also govern article usage.

3. It cannot be said that dikaioma singular ALWAYS means moral law and dikaioma plural ALWAYS means ceremonial. The pattern holds in law-referent contexts but not universally (Rev 15:4; 19:8).

4. It cannot be said that cheirographon (Col 2:14) refers to the Decalogue. The etymology (hand-written) and the paired term (tois dogmasin) both point away from the God-written Decalogue.

5. It cannot be said that the vocabulary differences are merely "stylistic variation." The distribution patterns (entole for moral, dogma for abolished) are consistent across multiple authors and contexts, which distinguishes them from random variation.

6. It cannot be said that all NT law vocabulary is interchangeable. Nomos has the widest range, but entole and dogma have demonstrably different distribution patterns that correlate with moral vs. ceremonial referents.

## Classification Decision Trees Applied

### Tree 1 (Tier) — Applied to all 49 items
- E1-E32: Each directly quotes or closely paraphrases verse text -> E-CHECK -> plain lexical meaning -> TIER: E
- N1-N9: Each follows from E-items without added concepts -> N-CHECK -> N1 yes, N2 yes (universal agreement), N3 no (no interpretation choice), N4 no (nothing added) -> TIER: N
- I1-I8: Each systematizes, adds external concepts, or has competing E/N -> not E, not N -> TIER: I -> Tree 2

### Tree 2 (I-Type) — Applied to all 8 inferences
- I1: Source test -> all in E/N? YES -> text-derived -> Direction test -> no E/N overridden? NO -> I-A
- I2: Same -> I-A
- I3: Source test -> "indivisible law" concept in E/N? NO -> external -> Direction test -> overrides N1, N2, N6? YES -> I-D
- I4: Source test -> "Decalogue = cheirographon" in E/N? NO (N3 says opposite) -> requires overriding -> I-D
- I5: Source test -> papyri background in E/N? NO -> external -> Direction test -> overrides anything? NO -> I-C
- I6: Source test -> all in E/N? YES -> text-derived -> Direction test -> E29 complicates? YES -> I-B
- I7: Source test -> all in E/N? YES -> text-derived -> Direction test -> Rev 15:4, 19:8 complicate? YES -> I-B
- I8: Source test -> "divinely intended" in E/N? NO -> external -> Direction test -> overrides nothing? NO -> I-C
