## Question
What do entole, nomos, dogma, cheirographon, and dikaioma reveal about law categories in the NT?

---

## 1. Entole (G1785) -- "Commandment, Injunction, Order"

**Original:** ἐντολή
**Transliteration:** entole
**Pronunciation:** en-tol-AY
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**NT Occurrences:** 71 (BLB), 43 in Strong's translation DB
**Definition:** Injunction, i.e. an authoritative prescription

### Translations in KJV
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|------------|
| commandment | 23 | 53.5% |
| commandments | 12 | 27.9% |
| precept | 2 | 4.7% |
| a commandment | 2 | 4.7% |
| of the commandments | 1 | 2.3% |
| the commandments | 1 | 2.3% |
| of commandments | 1 | 2.3% |
| of the commandment | 1 | 2.3% |

### Classification of All NT Occurrences by Referent

**For Decalogue / God's Moral Commands (majority):**
- Mat 5:19 -- "these least commandments" (in context of law not passing away)
- Mat 15:3,6 -- "commandment of God" vs. tradition of men
- Mat 19:17 -- "keep the commandments" = Decalogue listed (vv.18-19)
- Mat 22:36,38,40 -- greatest commandment = love God/neighbor
- Mar 7:8,9 -- "commandment of God" vs. tradition of men
- Mar 10:19 -- "the commandments" = Decalogue listed
- Mar 12:28,29,30,31 -- first/greatest commandment
- Luk 1:6 -- "commandments and ordinances of the Lord"
- Luk 18:20 -- "the commandments" = Decalogue listed
- Luk 23:56 -- "rested the sabbath day according to the commandment"
- Rom 7:8,9,10,11,12,13 -- "the commandment" = 10th commandment (Thou shalt not covet)
- Rom 13:9 -- Decalogue commands called "commandment"
- 1 Cor 7:19 -- "keeping the commandments of God" (distinguished from circumcision)
- Eph 6:2 -- 5th commandment cited as binding ("first commandment with promise")

**For Jesus's Commands (moral/ethical):**
- Jhn 10:18 -- Father's commandment
- Jhn 12:49,50 -- Father's commandment to Jesus
- Jhn 13:34 -- "new commandment...love one another"
- Jhn 14:15,21 -- "keep my commandments"
- Jhn 14:31 -- "as the Father gave me commandment"
- Jhn 15:10 -- "keep my commandments...Father's commandments"
- Jhn 15:12 -- "This is my commandment, that ye love one another"

**For Believer Obligation (moral/continuing):**
- 1 Jhn 2:3,4 -- "keep his commandments" = test of knowing God
- 1 Jhn 2:7,8 -- old/new commandment (love)
- 1 Jhn 3:22,23,24 -- "keep his commandments"
- 1 Jhn 4:21 -- love brother = commandment from God
- 1 Jhn 5:2,3 -- "keep his commandments; not grievous"
- 2 Jhn 1:4,5,6 -- "walking in truth, as we received commandment"
- 2 Pe 2:21 -- "the holy commandment delivered"
- 2 Pe 3:2 -- "commandment of the apostles"
- Rev 12:17 -- end-time saints "keep the commandments of God"
- Rev 14:12 -- "keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus"
- Rev 22:14 -- "do his commandments...right to the tree of life"

**For Ceremonial/Levitical (always with qualifier):**
- Heb 7:5 -- "commandment to take tithes" (Levitical priesthood function)
- Heb 7:16 -- "law of a CARNAL commandment" (sarkines = qualifier)
- Heb 7:18 -- "disannulling of the commandment going before" (contextual = Levitical)
- Heb 9:19 -- "every precept...according to the law" (Moses's pronouncement of all regulations)

**CRITICAL: Eph 2:15 -- Entole qualified by "en dogmasin":**
- "the law of commandments [entole] IN ORDINANCES [en dogmasin]"
- The en dogmasin qualifier specifies which commandments are abolished
- Without the dogma qualifier, entole elsewhere = moral commands

**Other/Non-law uses:**
- Luk 15:29 -- "thy commandment" (father's household command)
- Acts 17:15 -- "commandment" (Paul's instruction to deliver message)
- Col 4:10 -- "commandments" (apostolic instructions about Marcus)
- Tit 1:14 -- "commandments of MEN" (pejorative)
- 1 Tim 6:14 -- "this commandment" (Timothy's charge)
- 1 Cor 14:37 -- "commandments of the Lord"
- Jhn 11:57 -- chief priests' commandment

### Key Finding
Entole alone (without qualifiers like sarkines or en dogmasin) is NEVER used in the NT for a ceremonial regulation that was abolished. When entole appears in a ceremonial/cessation context, it always carries a qualifier:
- Heb 7:16: "entoles SARKINES" (carnal commandment)
- Eph 2:15: "ton entolon EN DOGMASIN" (of commandments in ordinances)

### LXX Connection
- Primary Hebrew source: **mitsvah (H4687)** -- 153 times (dominant mapping)
- Secondary sources: piqqud (H6490) 19x, chuqqah (H2708) 23x, choq (H2706) 22x, torah (H8451) 23x
- The LXX established entole as the standard Greek translation for mitsvah (divine command)

## 2. Nomos (G3551) -- "Law, Custom, Principle"

**Original:** νόμος
**Transliteration:** nomos
**Pronunciation:** NOM-os
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**NT Occurrences:** 197 (BLB), 169 in Strong's DB
**Definition:** From nemo (to parcel out); law

### Translations in KJV
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|------------|
| law | 95 | 56.2% |
| the law | 49 | 29.0% |
| of the law | 14 | 8.3% |
| a law | 2 | 1.2% |
| laws | 2 | 1.2% |
| other | 7 | 4.1% |

### Paul's Four Senses of Nomos
(Per prior study law-16)

1. **Torah/Code** -- The Mosaic law as a body: Rom 2:17,18,20,23; 3:19; Gal 3:17-19
2. **Decalogue specifically** -- When Paul quotes content: Rom 7:7 (Thou shalt not covet); Rom 13:8-10 (Decalogue commands)
3. **Operating principle** -- "law of faith" (Rom 3:27), "law of sin" (Rom 7:23), "law of the Spirit" (Rom 8:2), "law of Christ" (Gal 6:2)
4. **Pentateuch as Scripture-witness** -- Rom 3:21 ("witnessed by the law and the prophets")

### The Article Pattern: Articular vs. Anarthrous Nomos

**Articular (ho nomos / ton nomon / tou nomou) -- tends toward specific, known referent:**
- Rom 2:12,14,23,25,27: "the law" = the Mosaic law as known system
- Rom 3:19,31: "the law" = the established law code
- Rom 4:15: "THE law worketh wrath" (first occurrence, articular = the known Mosaic law)
- Rom 7:1,7,12,14,22,25: "the law" = specific law Paul is discussing (identified as Decalogue in v.7)
- Gal 3:17,19,21,23: "the law" = the Mosaic code given 430 years after Abraham
- Gal 5:14: "all THE law is fulfilled" = the entire known moral standard

**Anarthrous (nomos / nomou / nomo) -- tends toward qualitative/principle/generic:**
- Rom 2:14: "Gentiles which have not law...are a law unto themselves" (generic concept)
- Rom 3:20: "by deeds of law" (anarthrous = law-principle, not specific code)
- Rom 3:21: "apart from law" (choris nomou = apart from the law-system)
- Rom 3:27: "law of works...law of faith" (anarthrous = principle/type)
- Rom 4:15: "where no law is" (second occurrence, anarthrous = generic concept of law)
- Gal 2:16: "works of law" (ergon nomou -- anarthrous, debated whether = "legalistic works" or "Torah-works")
- Gal 2:19: "through law...dead to law" (both anarthrous = law-principle)
- Gal 3:21: "if a law given" (anarthrous = hypothetical any-law)

**Important caveat:** Greek article usage is governed by grammar norms (definiteness, previous reference, monadic nouns), not solely by theological categories. Nomos as a monadic noun (one-of-a-kind) can be definite without the article. The pattern is a tendency, not an absolute rule.

### Non-Pauline Nomos Usage
- **James:** "perfect law of liberty" (1:25), "royal law" (2:8), "law of liberty" (2:12) -- articular, definitive
- **Hebrews:** "laws into their minds" (8:10, 10:16 -- plural, new covenant); "law of a carnal commandment" (7:16); "the law having a shadow" (10:1)
- **John:** nomos rarely used; primarily "the law" referring to Mosaic system

### LXX Connection
- Primary Hebrew source: **torah (H8451)** -- 188 times (dominant mapping)
- Secondary sources: choq (H2706) 17x, chuqqah (H2708) 15x, mitsvah (H4687) 18x, dath (H1882/1881) 12x
- Torah->nomos is the most stable Hebrew-to-Greek mapping in the LXX law vocabulary

## 3. Dogma (G1378) -- "Decree, Ordinance, Dogma"

**Original:** δόγμα
**Transliteration:** dogma
**Pronunciation:** DOG-mah
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**NT Occurrences:** 5
**Definition:** From the base of dokeo; a law (civil, ceremonial or ecclesiastical)

### All 5 NT Occurrences
| Verse | Translation | Context | Referent |
|-------|------------|---------|----------|
| Luke 2:1 | a decree | Caesar Augustus's census decree | Civil/imperial |
| Acts 16:4 | decrees | Jerusalem Council decisions | Ecclesiastical |
| Acts 17:7 | decrees | Caesar's decrees (accusation) | Civil/imperial |
| Eph 2:15 | ordinances | "law of commandments in ordinances" | Ceremonial (ABOLISHED) |
| Col 2:14 | of ordinances | "handwriting of ordinances" | Ceremonial (NAILED TO CROSS) |

### Verbal Form: Dogmatizo (G1379)
- 1 occurrence: Col 2:20 -- "why are ye subject to ordinances?"
- Passive voice: being subjected to ceremonial rules from outside
- Context: "Touch not; taste not; handle not" -- dietary/purity regulations

### Key Finding
Dogma is NEVER used for God's moral commandments in any NT passage. Its distribution is:
- 2x civil/imperial decrees (Caesar)
- 1x ecclesiastical decrees (Jerusalem Council)
- 2x ceremonial regulations that were abolished (Eph 2:15, Col 2:14)

### The Eph 2:15 Construction
Greek: τὸν νόμον τῶν ἐντολῶν ἐν δόγμασιν (ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin)

Grammatical analysis:
- ton nomon (Acc Sg M) = "THE law" (articular, direct object of katargesas)
- ton entolon (Gen Pl F) = "of THE commandments" (articular genitive, descriptive)
- en dogmasin (Dat Pl N) = "in ordinances" (dative of sphere/location)

This is a NARROWING construction:
1. The law (broad)
2. -> of the commandments (which commandments?)
3. -> in/consisting of ordinances (the ceremonial-decree kind)

The en dogmasin acts as the final qualifier that identifies WHICH law of commandments is abolished -- the portion expressed as dogmata (decrees/ordinances), not the entolai themselves as a whole.

### LXX Background
The lexicon notes dogma appears in LXX contexts (Dan 2:13; 3:10; 4:3; 6:13; Esther 2; 3:9) -- all in the sense of royal/governmental decrees, never for God's moral commandments. This usage pattern is consistent from LXX through NT.

## 4. Cheirographon (G5498) -- "Handwriting, Certificate of Debt"

**Original:** χειρόγραφον
**Transliteration:** cheirographon
**Pronunciation:** khi-ROG-ra-fon
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**NT Occurrences:** 1 (hapax legomenon)
**Definition:** Compound of cheir (G5495, hand) + grapho (G1125, write) = "something hand-written"

### The Single Occurrence: Colossians 2:14
Greek: ἐξαλείψας τὸ καθ' ἡμῶν χειρόγραφον τοῖς δόγμασιν
- exaleipsas = "having blotted out" (Aor Act Ptcp)
- to cheirographon = "the handwriting" (articular, Acc Sg N)
- tois dogmasin = "in/by the ordinances" (articular, Dat Pl N)

### Compound Etymology
- cheir (G5495) = "hand" -- human hand
- grapho (G1125) = "to write"
- Combined = "hand-written document"

### Authorship Contrast
| Document | Written By | Medium | Location |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Decalogue | "finger of God" (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10) | Tables of stone | IN the ark (Exo 25:16) |
| Book of the Law | Moses's hand (Deu 31:24) | A book/scroll | BESIDE the ark (Deu 31:26) |
| Cheirographon | "hand-written" (human authorship implied) | Document | Nailed to the cross |

The compound cheir-graphon ("hand-written") inherently contrasts with what was written by "the finger of God." The Decalogue cannot be a cheirographon because it was not hand-written by a human author.

### Greco-Roman Legal Background
In Greco-Roman papyri, cheirographon was a technical legal term for:
- A handwritten debt certificate or IOU
- A signed acknowledgment of debt or obligation
- A legal bond or contract

The phrase "to cheirographon tois dogmasin" may therefore mean "the debt-certificate consisting of/expressed in the ordinances" -- the ceremonial law as a record of obligations that stood against humanity.

### The Dative tois dogmasin
Three possible readings of the dative:
1. **Instrumental:** "the handwriting BY MEANS OF ordinances" (the document written through ordinances)
2. **Locative:** "the handwriting IN THE SPHERE OF ordinances" (the document that exists in the ordinance-system)
3. **Content/Appositional:** "the handwriting CONSISTING OF ordinances" (the document that is the ordinances themselves)

All three readings associate cheirographon with dogma, not with entole or the Decalogue.

## 5. Dikaioma (G1345) -- "Ordinance, Righteous Requirement, Righteous Act"

**Original:** δικαίωμα
**Transliteration:** dikaioma
**Pronunciation:** dik-AH-yo-mah
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**NT Occurrences:** 10
**Definition:** From dikaioo; an equitable deed; by implication, a statute or decision

### All 10 NT Occurrences with Classification
| Verse | Form | Translation | Context | Category |
|-------|------|------------|---------|----------|
| Luk 1:6 | dikaiōmasin (Dat Pl) | ordinances | "commandments AND ordinances of the Lord" | General obedience |
| Rom 1:32 | dikaiōma (Nom Sg) | judgment | "the judgment of God" | God's righteous decree |
| Rom 2:26 | dikaiōmata (Acc Pl) | righteousness | "keep the righteousness of the law" | Moral law requirements |
| Rom 5:16 | dikaiōma (Acc Sg) | justification | "free gift...unto justification" | Forensic/legal act |
| Rom 5:18 | dikaiōmatos (Gen Sg) | righteousness | "by the righteousness of one" | Christ's righteous act |
| **Rom 8:4** | **dikaiōma (Nom Sg, ARTICULAR)** | **righteousness** | **"THE righteousness of THE law fulfilled in us"** | **Moral law's unified requirement** |
| **Heb 9:1** | **dikaiōmata (Acc Pl, ANARTHROUS)** | **ordinances** | **"ordinances of divine service"** | **Ceremonial regulations** |
| **Heb 9:10** | **dikaiōmata (Nom Pl, ANARTHROUS)** | **ordinances** | **"carnal ordinances...until the time of reformation"** | **Ceremonial (temporal)** |
| Rev 15:4 | dikaiōmata (Nom Pl) | judgments | "thy judgments are made manifest" | God's righteous acts |
| Rev 19:8 | dikaiōmata (Acc Pl) | righteousness | "the righteousness of saints" | Saints' righteous deeds |

### The Singular/Plural Pattern
**SINGULAR (to dikaioma, with article) -- Rom 8:4:**
- "THE righteous requirement of THE law" = one unified moral standard
- Greek: τὸ δικαίωμα τοῦ νόμου (to dikaioma tou nomou)
- Both article present = specific, definite
- Connects back to Rom 7:7 where Paul identified "the law" as the Decalogue
- Fulfilled "in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit"

**PLURAL (dikaiomata, typically anarthrous) -- Heb 9:1,10:**
- "ordinances of divine service" = multiple ceremonial regulations
- "carnal ordinances imposed until the time of reformation" = explicitly temporal
- Greek: δικαιώματα λατρείας (dikaiomata latreias) / δικαιώματα σαρκός (dikaiomata sarkos)
- Plural = multiple individual regulations; qualified as "carnal" and "until..."

### The Dual-Referent Pattern
Dikaioma's semantic range spans both moral and ceremonial contexts:
- **Moral/righteous requirement:** Rom 2:26; 8:4 (singular, articular when referring to unified moral standard)
- **Ceremonial regulations:** Heb 9:1,10 (plural, qualified by latreia/sarkos)
- **Forensic/justification:** Rom 5:16,18 (Christ's righteous act)
- **General righteous acts:** Rev 15:4; 19:8

The context always disambiguates, particularly through:
1. Number (singular vs. plural)
2. Article (articular vs. anarthrous)
3. Modifiers (sarkos = carnal; latreia = worship service)

### LXX Connection -- The "Catch-All" Function
Dikaioma translates SEVEN different Hebrew law terms in the LXX:
| Hebrew Term | Count | Primary Meaning |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| mishpat (H4941) | 63 | judgment, ordinance |
| choq (H2706) | 52 | statute, decree |
| chuqqah (H2708) | 35 | statute, ordinance |
| mitsvah (H4687) | 27 | commandment |
| torah (H8451) | 16 | instruction, law |
| piqqud (H6490) | 6 | precept |
| edah (H5713) | 4 | testimony |

This explains dikaioma's wide NT semantic range: it inherited the breadth of seven Hebrew predecessors through the LXX translation process. It is NOT inherently "ceremonial" or "moral" -- context determines the referent.

## 7. The Vocabulary Map: Do the Five Terms Encode Categories?

### Distribution Pattern Across Law Contexts

| Term | Moral Law Affirmed | Ceremonial Law Abolished | Neutral/Mixed |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| **entole (G1785)** | Mat 19:17; Mar 10:19; Rom 7:12; 13:9; 1 Cor 7:19; 1 Jhn 2:3; Rev 12:17; 14:12 | ONLY with qualifier: Eph 2:15 (en dogmasin); Heb 7:16 (sarkines) | Jhn 14:15; Col 4:10; Acts 17:15 |
| **nomos (G3551)** | Rom 3:31; 7:12,14,22; 8:4; Jas 1:25; 2:8-12 | Eph 2:15 (qualified); Heb 7:12,16; 10:1 (as shadow) | Rom 3:27 (principle); Gal 3:19,24 |
| **dogma (G1378)** | NEVER | Eph 2:15; Col 2:14 | Luk 2:1; Acts 16:4; 17:7 (civil/ecclesiastical) |
| **cheirographon (G5498)** | NEVER | Col 2:14 | -- |
| **dikaioma (G1345)** | Rom 2:26; 8:4 (singular) | Heb 9:1,10 (plural + sarkos/latreia) | Rom 1:32; 5:16,18; Rev 15:4; 19:8 |

### Key Observations
1. **Entole** alone = overwhelmingly moral commands. Ceremonial use requires explicit qualifier.
2. **Dogma** = EXCLUSIVELY non-moral: civil decrees OR abolished ceremonial regulations. Never for God's moral commands.
3. **Cheirographon** = the document of ceremonial obligations, hand-written (vs. God-written Decalogue).
4. **Dikaioma** = context-dependent; singular+articular = moral standard; plural+sarkos = ceremonial.
5. **Nomos** = widest range; encompasses both; context (including article usage) determines referent.

### The Greek Article Pattern in Nomos -- Summary
| Pattern | Tendency | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| ho nomos (articular nominative) | Specific known law (Mosaic code) | Rom 7:7,12: "THE law is holy" |
| ton nomon (articular accusative) | Specific law being discussed | Rom 3:31: "do we make void THE law?" |
| tou nomou (articular genitive) | "of THE law" = the Mosaic standard | Rom 8:4: "THE righteousness of THE law" |
| nomou (anarthrous genitive) | Law as principle/category | Rom 3:20: "by deeds of law" |
| nomos (anarthrous nominative) | Law as concept/generic | Rom 4:15: "where no law is" |
| nomon X (anarthrous + qualifier) | A type of law/principle | Rom 3:27: "law of works...law of faith" |

### LXX Bridge Summary
| Hebrew | Primary Greek | NT Function |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| torah (H8451) | nomos (G3551) 188x | Widest law term; requires context |
| mitsvah (H4687) | entole (G1785) 153x | Moral command; Decalogue association |
| choq (H2706) | dikaioma (G1345) 52x | Statute; ceremonial when plural+qualified |
| mishpat (H4941) | krima (G2917) 175x | Judgment (not a primary law-20 term) |
| chuqqah (H2708) | dikaioma (G1345) 35x | Ordinance; overlaps with choq |

The LXX maintained torah->nomos and mitsvah->entole as stable mappings. But it COMPRESSED other Hebrew distinctions: piqqud collapsed into entole; choq/chuqqah had no single dominant equivalent (dikaioma was partial). This means NT Greek has LESS law-vocabulary precision than OT Hebrew (per law-06 finding N032).

## 8. Greek Parsing Data for Key Verses

### Matthew 19:17 -- "keep the commandments"
- τήρει (tereo) = Present Active Imperative 2S ("keep!" -- ongoing obligation)
- τὰς ἐντολάς (tas entolas) = ARTICULAR accusative plural ("THE commandments")
- Jesus then identifies these as Decalogue commands in vv.18-19

### Hebrews 7:16 -- "carnal commandment"
- νόμον (nomos) = Accusative Singular (ANARTHROUS = qualitative)
- ἐντολῆς (entoles) = Genitive Singular (descriptive genitive)
- σαρκίνης (sarkines) = Genitive Singular Feminine ("CARNAL" -- modifier of entole)
- Contrast: κατὰ δύναμιν ζωῆς ἀκαταλύτου ("according to power of indestructible life")

### Romans 8:4 -- "the righteousness of the law"
- τὸ δικαίωμα (to dikaioma) = ARTICULAR nominative singular ("THE righteous requirement")
- τοῦ νόμου (tou nomou) = ARTICULAR genitive singular ("of THE law")
- πληρωθῇ (plerothe) = Aorist Passive Subjunctive 3S ("might be fulfilled" -- divine passive)
- Double article = specific, definite referent = the one moral standard of the known law

### Hebrews 9:1 -- "ordinances of divine service"
- δικαιώματα (dikaiomata) = ANARTHROUS accusative PLURAL ("regulations")
- λατρείας (latreias) = Genitive Singular ("of worship/service")
