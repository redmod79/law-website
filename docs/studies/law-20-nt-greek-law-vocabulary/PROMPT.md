# law-20: NT Greek Law Vocabulary

## Question
What do entole, nomos, dogma, cheirographon, and dikaioma reveal about law categories in the NT? Investigate whether the Greek vocabulary itself encodes the moral/ceremonial distinction. Study entole (G1785 -- commandment: used for Decalogue in Mat 19:17-19, Mark 10:19, Rom 13:9, but also for ceremonial in Heb 7:16, 9:19), nomos (G3551 -- law: widest range, from Pentateuch to moral law to principle), dogma (G1378 -- decree/ordinance: Luke 2:1, Acts 16:4, Eph 2:15, Col 2:14), cheirographon (G5498 -- handwriting: Col 2:14 only), dikaioma (G1345 -- ordinance/righteous requirement: Heb 9:1,10 for sanctuary ordinances, Rom 8:4 for law's requirement fulfilled in us). Include grammar patterns: when Paul uses nomos with and without the article, what difference does it make?

## Series Context
This is study 20 in a 31-study series on the Law of God. The series investigates whether God's moral law (Ten Commandments, including Sabbath) continues or was abolished at the cross. Both positions agree ceremonial/civil laws ceased -- the debate is ONLY about the moral law.

## Prior Study Analysis

### Highly Relevant Prior Studies

The study database returned extensive prior analysis on the five Greek law terms. The following prior studies are directly relevant:

#### 1. law-06-hebrew-law-vocabulary (CRITICAL -- OT companion study)
- The Hebrew counterpart to this study: analyzed torah, mitsvah, choq, mishpat, edut, piqqud, chuqqah
- **Key finding:** Hebrew law terms describe formal character (instruction, command, decree, judgment, testimony) not moral categories (moral, ceremonial, civil). No Hebrew term means exclusively "moral law" or "ceremonial law."
- **N032:** The LXX translators maintained torah->nomos and mitsvah->entole as stable mappings but compressed other Hebrew terms (piqqud collapsed into entole; choq/chuqqah had no single dominant equivalent). NT Greek has LESS law-vocabulary precision than OT Hebrew.
- **E218:** Torah maps to nomos 188 times in the LXX; mitsvah maps to entole 153 times.
- **E220:** Dikaioma (G1345) is the LXX catch-all -- secondary translation for seven different Hebrew terms (torah 16x, mitsvah 27x, choq 52x, chuqqah 35x, mishpat 63x, edah 4x, piqqud 6x).
- **I038:** Paul's nomos/entole distinction in Rom 7:7-12 maps to the Hebrew torah/mitsvah distinction via LXX.
- Conclusion path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-06-hebrew-law-vocabulary/CONCLUSION.md

#### 2. nt-commandments-vs-ordinances (CRITICAL -- directly overlapping)
- Studied exactly the entole vs. dogma vs. dikaioma distinction
- **Key finding:** NT authors use entole (G1785) for God's moral commands and dogma (G1378) for ceremonial regulations. Dogma is NEVER used for God's moral commandments in any NT passage.
- Entole: 71 NT occurrences; consistently for moral commands; used for Decalogue in Rom 7:7-12, Mat 22:36-40, Rom 13:9
- Dogma: 5 NT occurrences; Caesar's decree (Luke 2:1, Acts 17:7), apostolic council (Acts 16:4), abolished ordinances (Eph 2:15, Col 2:14) -- never for moral commands
- Dikaioma: 10 NT occurrences; dual range -- ceremonial statutes (Heb 9:1,10) vs. righteous requirement (Rom 8:4)
- Luke 1:6 uses entole AND dikaioma side by side as two categories
- Eph 2:15 narrowing construction: ton nomon -> ton entolon -> en dogmasin
- Conclusion path: D:/bible/bible-studies/nt-commandments-vs-ordinances/CONCLUSION.md

#### 3. law-08-abolished-at-cross (CRITICAL -- vocabulary comparison)
- Analyzed all seven NT abolition passages and their Greek vocabulary
- **Key finding:** Each abolition passage identifies its referent through specific Greek vocabulary; none names the Decalogue as abolished
- **E1/E054:** Col 2:14 uses cheirographon tois dogmasin -- hand-written document of ordinances
- **E2/E053:** Eph 2:15 uses ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin -- law of commandments IN ordinances
- **E31/E250:** Cheirographon = "hand-written" (hapax legomenon); Decalogue was written by "the finger of God" (Exo 31:18)
- **N1:** None of the seven abolition passages names the Decalogue
- **N2/N018:** Dogma (G1378) is never used for the Decalogue
- **N3:** Cheirographon = hand-written vs. Decalogue = God-written (different authorships)
- **I2:** Dogma/cheirographon form a "cessation vocabulary" separate from entole/nomos used for moral law
- Full vocabulary comparison table across all 7 passages in word study
- Conclusion path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-08-abolished-at-cross/CONCLUSION.md

#### 4. law-16-paul-and-law-in-romans (HIGHLY relevant -- nomos usage)
- Systematic examination of nomos in Romans (74 uses)
- **N080:** Paul uses nomos in at least four distinct senses: (1) Torah/code, (2) Decalogue specifically (when quoting content, e.g., Rom 7:7), (3) operating principle ("law of faith" Rom 3:27, "law of sin" Rom 7:23), (4) Pentateuch as Scripture-witness (Rom 3:21)
- **E403/E026:** Rom 8:4 -- singular dikaioma with article = "THE righteous requirement of THE law" fulfilled in Spirit-walkers
- **E407:** Rom 13:9 -- Paul quotes five Decalogue commands as content love fulfills
- Key for nomos article question: When Paul writes ho nomos (articular), he typically means the Mosaic law as a specific body; when anarthrous nomos appears, it can mean "law as principle" or "a law"
- Conclusion path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-16-paul-and-law-in-romans/CONCLUSION.md

#### 5. law-17-paul-and-law-in-galatians (RELEVANT -- nomos usage)
- 32 occurrences of nomos in Galatians
- Paul's semantic range in Galatians: Torah/code, Decalogue, operating principle, Scripture-witness
- "Law of Christ" (Gal 6:2) as distinct usage
- Conclusion path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-17-paul-and-law-in-galatians/CONCLUSION.md

#### 6. law-04-ceremonial-laws (RELEVANT -- vocabulary distinction)
- Established the ceremonial vocabulary pattern: dogma in Eph 2:15/Col 2:14, dikaioma in Heb 9:1,10, skia (shadow) in Heb 10:1/Col 2:17
- **Comprehensive Contrast Table:** Decalogue vs. Ceremonial Law across delivery, authorship, medium, repository, vocabulary dimensions
- **The Vocabulary Distinction section:** NT consistently uses specific vocabulary for what was abolished: dogma for abolition passages, dikaioma with "carnal" modifier for temple regulations, entole for continuing moral commands
- Conclusion path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-04-ceremonial-laws/CONCLUSION.md

#### 7. law-07-law-of-moses (RELEVANT -- nomos/dikaioma)
- Analyzed all 21 "law of Moses" occurrences
- Word study on dikaioma (G1345) -- all 10 NT occurrences with context table
- Key observation: dikaioma shows how the same Greek term can reference both ceremonial regulations (Heb 9:1,10) and the moral law's righteous requirement (Rom 8:4)
- Vocabulary distribution pattern table: nomos, entole, dogma, dikaioma mapped to "Law of Moses" vs. "Law of God" contexts
- Conclusion path: D:/bible/bible-studies/law-07-law-of-moses/CONCLUSION.md

#### 8. law-01-gods-moral-law (RELEVANT -- word study foundation)
- Word studies on [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} entole, [G1378](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1378/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} dogma, [G1345](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1345/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} dikaioma, [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} nomos

## Key Research Angles

### Angle 1: Entole (G1785) -- Does It Encode "Moral Command"?
Entole has 71 NT occurrences. Prior studies found it consistently used for God's moral commands (Decalogue: Rom 7:7-12, Mat 22:36-40, Rom 13:9; believer obligation: 1 Jhn 2:3, Rev 12:17, 14:12) and NEVER for something abolished WITHOUT the qualifier "en dogmasin" (Eph 2:15). However, Heb 7:16,18 uses entole for the Levitical priesthood succession commandment.

**Research needed:**
- Retrieve ALL 71 NT occurrences of entole (G1785) with context
- Classify each occurrence by referent: Decalogue, Jesus's commands, moral obligation, ceremonial/Levitical, other
- Determine if entole alone (without qualifiers) is ever used for a ceremonial regulation that was abolished
- Examine Heb 7:16 "entoles sarkines" (carnal commandment) and Heb 9:19 "every entole" -- do these challenge the moral-command pattern?
- Compare entole in the Synoptics (Jesus's usage) vs. Paul vs. John vs. Hebrews

### Angle 2: Nomos (G3551) -- The Article Question
Nomos has 197 NT occurrences -- widest range of all. Paul uses nomos in at least four senses. The study question specifically asks: when Paul uses nomos with and without the article, what difference does it make?

**Research needed:**
- Retrieve a substantial sample of nomos passages showing articular (ho nomos) vs. anarthrous (nomos) usage
- Check: Does ho nomos (with article) consistently refer to the Mosaic law/Torah? Does anarthrous nomos shift toward "law as principle"?
- Key test passages: Rom 2:12 (anomos = without law), Rom 2:14 ("Gentiles which have not THE law...are a law unto themselves"), Rom 3:27 (nomos ergon vs. nomos pisteos -- both anarthrous), Rom 7:1 (ho nomos), Rom 7:21 (ton nomon -- principle?), Rom 7:22-23 (ho nomos tou theou vs. heteron nomon vs. nomo tou noos vs. nomo tes hamartias)
- Galatians: Gal 2:16 "works of law" (ergon nomou -- anarthrous), Gal 3:21 "if there had been a law given" (nomos, anarthrous)
- Does anarthrous usage in "works of law" (ergon nomou) carry theological significance?
- Compare with non-Pauline usage: Hebrews, James, John

### Angle 3: Dogma (G1378) -- A Cessation-Only Term?
Dogma appears only 5 times in the NT. Prior studies found it is NEVER used for God's moral commandments. Two uses are Caesar's decrees, one is the apostolic council, and two are abolition passages.

**Research needed:**
- Retrieve all 5 NT occurrences of dogma with full context
- Retrieve the single occurrence of dogmatizo (G1379, Col 2:20) with full context
- Is dogma's semantic range truly limited to civil/ceremonial regulations?
- Investigate the Eph 2:15 construction: ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin -- what does "en dogmasin" do grammatically to limit "ton nomon ton entolon"?
- LXX usage: Does dogma appear in the LXX? What Hebrew term(s) does it translate?
- Investigate Dan 2:13; 6:8 (LXX) for dogma usage in decree contexts

### Angle 4: Cheirographon (G5498) -- Hapax Analysis
Cheirographon appears only in Col 2:14 -- a hapax legomenon. Prior studies established: compound of cheir (hand) + grapho (write) = "hand-written document." This contrasts with the Decalogue written by God's finger.

**Research needed:**
- Full lexical analysis of [G5498](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5498/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} cheirographon
- Greco-Roman papyri and legal background: Was cheirographon a debt certificate, IOU, or legal bond?
- What does "to cheirographon tois dogmasin" mean -- "the handwriting IN the ordinances" or "the handwriting CONSISTING OF the ordinances"?
- The dative tois dogmasin: instrumental ("by means of ordinances"), locative ("in the sphere of ordinances"), or appositional ("namely, the ordinances")?
- Contrast with Exo 31:18 "written with the finger of God" and Deu 31:24 "Moses...finished writing...in a book"

### Angle 5: Dikaioma (G1345) -- The Dual-Referent Term
Dikaioma has 10 NT occurrences spanning ceremonial and moral contexts. The singular/plural pattern is striking.

**Research needed:**
- Retrieve all 10 NT occurrences of dikaioma with full context
- Document the singular (Rom 1:32; 2:26; 5:16,18; 8:4) vs. plural (Luk 1:6; Heb 9:1,10; Rev 15:4; 19:8) pattern
- Does singular dikaioma with article consistently point to the moral law's unified requirement?
- Does plural dikaiomata consistently point to ceremonial/ritual regulations?
- In Rom 8:4, how does "to dikaioma tou nomou" (the righteous requirement of the law) connect to the Decalogue identified in Rom 7:7?
- In Heb 9:1,10, how does "dikaiomata latreia" and "dikaiomata sarkos" differ from dikaioma in Rom 8:4?
- LXX catch-all function: How does dikaioma's absorption of seven Hebrew terms affect its NT usage?

### Angle 6: The Vocabulary Map -- Do the Five Terms Encode Categories?
The central question: Does the NT Greek vocabulary itself create a two-category system (moral vs. ceremonial)?

**Research needed:**
- Build a comprehensive cross-reference table: Which Greek term appears in which context (moral law affirmed, ceremonial law abolished, neutral)?
- Test for exceptions: Does entole ever appear in a pure cessation context without a qualifier? Does dogma ever appear in a moral-law context?
- Map the five terms to the "abolished" vs. "continues" passages identified in law-08
- Investigate overlap: Are there passages where the terms seem interchangeable?
- Consider the counter-argument: If the vocabulary encoded the distinction, why doesn't Paul use it more explicitly? Why does he use nomos for both?

### Angle 7: The Article Pattern in Nomos -- Grammatical Investigation
Beyond the general question, specific grammatical patterns need investigation:

**Research needed:**
- Rom 2:12-14: Three different constructions in rapid succession -- anomos, en nomo, nomon, nomos -- what does the variation signal?
- Rom 3:21: "choris nomou dikaiosyne theou" (apart from law, God's righteousness) -- anarthrous nomos
- Rom 4:15: "ho nomos orgen katergazetai; hou de ouk estin nomos, oude parabasis" -- articular then anarthrous in same verse
- Gal 2:19: "ego gar dia nomou nomo apethanon" (through law I died to law) -- both anarthrous
- Does the Greek grammar community recognize a consistent article/anarthrous distinction in Pauline nomos usage?

### Angle 8: Counter-Arguments to Investigate
The Abolished position argues:
- The Greek vocabulary is not as neatly divided as claimed; nomos (the broadest term) is used for both moral and ceremonial, showing the law is a single undivided body
- Entole in Heb 7:16,18 refers to a ceremonial commandment, proving entole is not exclusively "moral"
- Dikaioma in Heb 9:1,10 AND Rom 8:4 proves the term crosses categories -- it cannot encode a distinction
- Paul's articular/anarthrous nomos patterns are governed by Greek grammar norms (definiteness), not theological categories
- Cheirographon could be a metaphorical debt certificate (record of sins), not the ceremonial law code

**Research needed:**
- Investigate Heb 7:16,18 thoroughly: Is entole here an exception to the moral-command pattern, or is the context providing a different qualifier?
- Can dikaioma's dual usage be explained by context rather than encoded meaning?
- What do Greek grammar resources say about article usage with nomos?
- Is there scholarly support for reading cheirographon as a debt certificate rather than a law code?

### Key Prior Study Conclusions
- **law-06:** Hebrew vocabulary describes formal character, not moral categories; LXX compressed distinctions; NT Greek has less precision than Hebrew
- **nt-commandments-vs-ordinances:** NT makes lexically demonstrable distinction between entole (moral) and dogma (ceremonial); dogma never for moral commands
- **law-08:** Each abolition passage identifies referent through specific Greek vocabulary; none names the Decalogue; dogma/cheirographon = cessation vocabulary, entole/nomos = continuation vocabulary
- **law-16:** Paul uses nomos in at least four distinct senses; context determines referent; Rom 8:4 dikaioma singular = unified moral standard
- **law-04:** NT consistently uses specific vocabulary for abolished items (dogma, dikaioma+sarkos, skia) vs. continuing items (entole, nomos+holy/just/good)

## Differentiation from Prior Studies

**IMPORTANT:** Several prior studies have examined individual Greek law terms (law-01 word studies, law-04 vocabulary distinction, law-06 Hebrew/LXX mapping, law-08 vocabulary comparison, nt-commandments-vs-ordinances). Law-20 is different because it:

1. **Focuses specifically on the Greek vocabulary question:** Prior studies examined these terms within broader topical investigations. Law-20 makes the vocabulary analysis itself the primary subject.
2. **Addresses the nomos article question directly:** No prior study has systematically investigated articular vs. anarthrous nomos patterns in Paul.
3. **Synthesizes the LXX bridge from law-06 with NT usage:** Law-06 mapped Hebrew to Greek via LXX; law-20 picks up at the Greek end and examines how NT authors deploy the received vocabulary.
4. **Tests the vocabulary-encodes-distinction thesis:** Prior studies observed vocabulary patterns as supporting evidence; law-20 makes this the central question and must test for exceptions and counter-evidence.
5. **Must produce NEW E/N/I items** not already in the master evidence file, focusing on the specific grammatical and lexical patterns that have not yet been formally classified.

The research agent should USE prior study findings as established ground but must independently verify through the tool chain and discover new material, especially on the article pattern question and any passages where the vocabulary pattern breaks down.
