# Analysis: NT Greek Law Vocabulary

## Question
What do entole, nomos, dogma, cheirographon, and dikaioma reveal about law categories in the NT? Does the Greek vocabulary itself encode or support a moral/ceremonial distinction?

## Term 1: Entole (G1785) — "Commandment"

### Distribution by Referent

Entole appears 71 times in the NT. The occurrences classify by referent as follows:

| Referent Category | Count | Representative Passages |
|---|---|---|
| Decalogue / God's moral commands | ~20 | Mat 19:17-19; Mar 10:19; Luk 18:20; Rom 7:7-13; Rom 13:9; 1 Cor 7:19; Eph 6:2 |
| Jesus's commands (moral/ethical) | ~10 | Jhn 13:34; 14:15,21; 15:10,12; Jhn 10:18; 12:49-50 |
| Believer obligation (continuing) | ~20 | 1 Jhn 2:3-4,7-8; 3:22-24; 4:21; 5:2-3; 2 Jhn 1:4-6; Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14 |
| Ceremonial/Levitical (with qualifier) | 4 | Heb 7:5,16,18; 9:19 |
| Other/non-law uses | ~8 | Luk 15:29; Acts 17:15; Col 4:10; Tit 1:14; 1 Tim 6:14 |
| Abolition passage (with qualifier) | 1 | Eph 2:15 (entole + en dogmasin) |

### The Qualifier Pattern

The text states that when entole appears in a ceremonial or cessation context, a qualifying term is present:

- **Heb 7:16:** "entoles sarkines" — "carnal commandment." The adjective sarkines (G4560, "carnal/fleshly") modifies entole and identifies the referent as the Levitical priesthood succession law, contrasted in the same verse with "the power of an indestructible life."
- **Heb 7:18:** "the disannulling of the commandment going before" — context identifies this as the same Levitical succession command discussed since Heb 7:5.
- **Heb 9:19:** "every precept" — Moses's pronouncement of all regulations at covenant inauguration. The context is the blood-sprinkling ceremony, and "every entole" encompasses the entire body of law Moses communicated, not a specific moral or ceremonial subset.
- **Eph 2:15:** "ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin" — "the law of commandments in ordinances." The phrase en dogmasin (in decrees/ordinances) narrows which commandments are in view. Without this qualifier, entole alone does not appear in cessation passages.

When entole appears **without** a qualifier, it consistently references:
- Decalogue commands (Mat 19:17-19: Jesus lists specific Decalogue commandments; Mar 10:19: same listing; Rom 7:7-12: Paul quotes the 10th commandment; Rom 13:9: Paul lists five Decalogue commands)
- Jesus's commands to love (Jhn 13:34; 14:15; 15:10,12)
- Ongoing believer obligation (1 Jhn 2:3-4; 3:22-24; 5:2-3; Rev 12:17; 14:12; 22:14)
- The commandments of God distinguished from circumcision (1 Cor 7:19)

### The 1 Corinthians 7:19 Distinction

The text states: "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments [entolon] of God." Paul here uses entole for what matters and explicitly excludes circumcision (a ceremonial rite) from the category entole describes. This passage directly distinguishes entole from ceremonial law.

### Counter-evidence: Heb 7:16

The Abolished position cites Heb 7:16 as evidence that entole can refer to a ceremonial command. The text states: "not after the law of a carnal commandment [entoles sarkines]." The presence of the qualifier sarkines is itself a data point: the author of Hebrews found it necessary to add "carnal" to signal that this entole is not a moral command. If entole already carried ceremonial connotations, the qualifier would be redundant.

### Entole Verdict

The textual data shows: entole unqualified = moral commands. Entole in ceremonial contexts = always qualified. This is an observable vocabulary pattern across multiple NT authors (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, the author of Hebrews, the author of Revelation).

## Term 2: Nomos (G3551) — "Law"

### Semantic Range

Nomos has the widest semantic range of the five terms (197 NT occurrences). Prior study law-16 identified at least four Pauline senses:

1. **Torah/Code** — The Mosaic law as a legislative body: Rom 2:17-23; Gal 3:17-19
2. **Decalogue specifically** — When Paul quotes Decalogue content: Rom 7:7 (quotes 10th commandment); Rom 13:8-10 (lists Decalogue commands)
3. **Operating principle** — "Law of faith" (Rom 3:27), "law of sin" (Rom 7:23), "law of the Spirit" (Rom 8:2), "law of Christ" (Gal 6:2)
4. **Pentateuch as Scripture-witness** — Rom 3:21 ("witnessed by the law and the prophets")

### The Article Pattern: Articular vs. Anarthrous Nomos

The study question asks whether Paul's use of nomos with and without the Greek article correlates with different referents.

**Articular (ho nomos / ton nomon / tou nomou) — observed tendencies:**

| Passage | Form | Apparent Referent |
|---|---|---|
| Rom 7:1 | ho nomos | The Mosaic law as a known system |
| Rom 7:7 | ho nomos | The Decalogue (identified by 10th commandment quotation) |
| Rom 7:12 | ho nomos | The law Paul has been discussing = the Decalogue |
| Rom 7:14 | ho nomos | Same referent — "the law is spiritual" |
| Rom 7:22 | to nomo tou theou | "The law of God" — specific, identified law |
| Rom 3:19 | ho nomos | The law code that speaks to those under it |
| Rom 3:31 | nomon (anarthrous) | See below — articular NOT used here |
| Gal 3:17 | ho nomos | The law given 430 years after Abraham |
| Gal 5:14 | ho pas nomos | "All the law" = the entire known moral standard |

**Anarthrous (nomos / nomou / nomo) — observed tendencies:**

| Passage | Form | Apparent Referent |
|---|---|---|
| Rom 2:14 | nomon (2x) | "Law" as a generic concept — Gentiles "have not law" |
| Rom 3:20 | nomou | "By deeds of law" — law-as-principle/system |
| Rom 3:21 | choris nomou | "Apart from law" — the law-system generically |
| Rom 3:27 | nomou (2x) | "Law of works...law of faith" — operating principles |
| Rom 4:15 | nomos (2nd occurrence) | "Where no law is" — generic concept |
| Gal 2:16 | ergon nomou (3x) | "Works of law" — debated: Torah-works or legalistic works |
| Gal 2:19 | nomou, nomo | "Through law...dead to law" — law-as-system |
| Gal 3:21 | nomos | "If a law given" — hypothetical any-law |

**The same verse with both patterns:**

- **Rom 4:15:** "THE law [ho nomos] worketh wrath: for where no law [nomos, anarthrous] is, there is no transgression." The articular form refers to the specific Mosaic law; the anarthrous form shifts to a general principle (where there is no law-concept).
- **Rom 7:7:** Paul opens with articular ho nomos ("Is THE law sin?"), shifts to anarthrous dia nomou ("through law"), then returns to articular ho nomos when quoting the Decalogue. The articular form anchors to the specific known law; the anarthrous form gestures toward the law-concept.

**Important grammatical caveat:** Greek article usage is governed by grammar norms (definiteness, previous reference, monadic nouns), not solely by theological categories. Nomos as a monadic noun (one-of-a-kind referent) can be definite even without the article. The pattern is a tendency that requires context to confirm, not an absolute rule.

### Article Pattern Verdict

The textual data shows a general tendency: articular nomos points toward the specific, known Mosaic law/Torah, while anarthrous nomos can shift toward a qualitative, generic, or principial sense. However, exceptions exist in both directions, and Greek grammar alone does not create a rigid theological division. Context remains the primary disambiguator.

## Term 3: Dogma (G1378) — "Decree, Ordinance"

### Complete Distribution (5 NT occurrences)

| Passage | Category | Text |
|---|---|---|
| Luke 2:1 | Civil/imperial | "A decree from Caesar Augustus" |
| Acts 16:4 | Ecclesiastical | "The decrees ordained of the apostles and elders" |
| Acts 17:7 | Civil/imperial | "Contrary to the decrees of Caesar" |
| Eph 2:15 | Abolished ceremonial | "The law of commandments contained in ordinances" |
| Col 2:14 | Abolished ceremonial | "The handwriting of ordinances...nailing it to his cross" |

The verbal form dogmatizo (G1379) appears once:
- **Col 2:20:** "Why are ye subject to ordinances?" — the context immediately identifies these as "Touch not; taste not; handle not" (Col 2:21), which are dietary/purity regulations characterized as "commandments and doctrines of men" (Col 2:22).

### Key Finding

Dogma is never used for God's moral commandments in any NT passage. Its distribution splits between civil/governmental decrees (Luke 2:1; Acts 16:4; 17:7) and ceremonial/regulatory material that was abolished (Eph 2:15; Col 2:14). Zero occurrences apply dogma to the Decalogue or to any moral command of God.

### LXX Background

In the LXX, dogma appears in Daniel and Esther in the sense of royal/governmental decrees (Dan 2:13; 3:10; 4:3; 6:13; Esth 3:9). This usage pattern — official decrees, never divine moral commands — is consistent from LXX through NT.

### The Eph 2:15 Narrowing Construction

Greek: ton nomon ton entolon en dogmasin

This is a progressive narrowing chain:
1. **ton nomon** (the law) — broadest term
2. **ton entolon** (of the commandments) — narrows to specific prescriptions
3. **en dogmasin** (in ordinances/decrees) — final qualifier specifying which commandments are abolished: those expressed as dogmata

The grammatical structure is: "the law [consisting] of commandments [expressed] in ordinances." The en dogmasin functions as a locative or instrumental qualifier that identifies which aspect of "the law of commandments" was abolished — the decree/ordinance portion, not the moral-command portion.

### Counter-considerations

The Abolished position does not cite dogma as evidence for its case (since dogma is never applied to the moral law). The vocabulary distribution of dogma is a data point both sides must reckon with.

## Term 4: Cheirographon (G5498) — "Handwriting, Certificate of Debt"

### The Single Occurrence: Col 2:14

Greek: exaleipsas to kath' hemon cheirographon tois dogmasin

The text states: "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross."

### Compound Etymology

Cheirographon = cheir (G5495, "hand") + grapho (G1125, "to write") = "a hand-written document."

### Authorship Contrast

The text provides the following data points about who wrote what:

| Document | Author | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Decalogue | God | "Written with the finger of God" (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10) |
| Book of the Law | Moses | "Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book" (Deu 31:24) |
| Cheirographon | Human hand implied | Compound cheir-graphon = "hand-written" |

The Decalogue was written by "the finger of God." A cheirographon is by definition "hand-written" (human authorship). These are different categories of authorship stated by the text itself.

### The Dative tois dogmasin

Three grammatically possible readings:
1. **Instrumental:** "the handwriting BY MEANS OF ordinances"
2. **Locative:** "the handwriting IN THE SPHERE OF ordinances"
3. **Content/Appositional:** "the handwriting CONSISTING OF ordinances"

All three readings associate cheirographon with dogma (decrees/ordinances), not with entole or the Decalogue.

### Greco-Roman Legal Background

In Greco-Roman papyri, cheirographon functioned as a technical legal term for a handwritten debt certificate, IOU, or signed acknowledgment of obligation. This background suggests Col 2:14 describes a record of debt/obligation — possibly the ceremonial system as a record of obligations that stood against sinners — that was blotted out at the cross.

### Counter-argument: Metaphorical Debt Certificate

The Abolished position offers an alternative reading: cheirographon is not a law code at all but a metaphorical record of sins or debt of guilt that humans owe God. On this reading, "tois dogmasin" would refer to the regulations by which that guilt was established. This reading does not require identifying cheirographon with either the Decalogue or the ceremonial law specifically — it makes it a record of condemnation.

This alternative reading is grammatically possible. However, even on this reading, cheirographon is not the Decalogue itself, since it is qualified by tois dogmasin (the ordinances/decrees) and described as something "nailed to the cross" — whereas the moral law is elsewhere described as "holy, just, and good" (Rom 7:12) and as something Paul "establishes" (Rom 3:31), not as something "against us."

## Term 5: Dikaioma (G1345) — "Ordinance, Righteous Requirement"

### Complete Distribution (10 NT occurrences)

| Passage | Number | Article | Modifier | Translation | Category |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Luk 1:6 | Plural | Anarthrous (under pasais) | tou Kyriou | ordinances | General obedience |
| Rom 1:32 | Singular | Anarthrous | tou Theou | judgment | God's righteous decree |
| Rom 2:26 | Plural | Anarthrous | tou nomou | righteousness | Moral law requirements |
| Rom 5:16 | Singular | Anarthrous | — | justification | Forensic/legal act |
| Rom 5:18 | Singular (genitive) | Anarthrous | — | righteousness | Christ's righteous act |
| **Rom 8:4** | **Singular** | **Articular (to dikaioma)** | **tou nomou** | **righteousness** | **Moral law's unified requirement** |
| **Heb 9:1** | **Plural** | **Anarthrous** | **latreias** | **ordinances** | **Ceremonial regulations** |
| **Heb 9:10** | **Plural** | **Anarthrous** | **sarkos** | **ordinances** | **Ceremonial (temporal)** |
| Rev 15:4 | Plural | Anarthrous | — | judgments | God's righteous acts |
| Rev 19:8 | Plural | Anarthrous | — | righteousness | Saints' righteous deeds |

### The Singular/Plural Pattern

**Singular with article (Rom 8:4):** "to dikaioma tou nomou" = "THE righteous requirement of THE law." Both nouns carry the article. The singular points to one unified moral standard. Context links to Rom 7:7 where Paul identified "the law" as the Decalogue by quoting the 10th commandment. This requirement is "fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit" — a present, ongoing moral reality.

**Plural (Heb 9:1,10):** "dikaiomata latreias" = "ordinances of divine service" and "dikaiomata sarkos" = "carnal ordinances." The plural points to multiple individual regulations. The modifiers latreias (worship service) and sarkos (carnal/fleshly) specify the ceremonial character. These are explicitly temporal: "imposed until the time of reformation" (Heb 9:10).

### The Luke 1:6 Two-Category Listing

"Walking in all the commandments [entolais, G1785] and ordinances [dikaiōmasin, G1345] of the Lord blameless."

Luke lists entolai and dikaiomata as two distinct categories of obedience, both under "the Lord." The conjunction kai (and) coordinates them as separate groups, not synonyms. Entolai is articular (tais entolais = THE commandments); dikaiōmasin is anarthrous.

### Dikaioma's Dual Usage

Dikaioma functions in both moral and ceremonial contexts. The term itself does not encode one category. Instead, the context disambiguates:
- **Number** (singular = unified standard; plural = multiple regulations)
- **Article** (articular = specific, identified; anarthrous = generic)
- **Modifiers** (sarkos = carnal; latreias = worship service; tou nomou = of the law)

This is consistent with dikaioma's LXX function as a "catch-all" translating seven different Hebrew law terms. It inherited breadth, not specificity.

## Synthesis: Does the Greek Vocabulary Encode a Moral/Ceremonial Distinction?

### The Vocabulary Distribution Map

| Term | Moral Law Affirmed | Ceremonial Law Abolished | Civil/Neutral |
|---|---|---|---|
| **entole** | Consistently (without qualifier) | Only with qualifier (sarkines, en dogmasin) | Some non-law uses |
| **nomos** | Rom 3:31; 7:12,14,22; 8:4; Jas 1:25; 2:8-12 | Eph 2:15 (qualified by en dogmasin); Heb 7:12,16; 10:1 | Multiple senses; context determines |
| **dogma** | Never | Eph 2:15; Col 2:14 | Luke 2:1; Acts 16:4; 17:7 (civil/ecclesiastical) |
| **cheirographon** | Never | Col 2:14 | — |
| **dikaioma** | Rom 2:26; 8:4 (singular, articular) | Heb 9:1,10 (plural + sarkos/latreia) | Rom 1:32; 5:16,18; Rev 15:4; 19:8 |

### Pattern Summary

1. **Entole alone = moral commands.** The pattern holds across Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, and Revelation. Every ceremonial use carries a qualifier.
2. **Dogma = never moral commands.** All 5 NT occurrences are civil decrees or abolished ceremonial material.
3. **Cheirographon = hand-written document.** The single occurrence is paired with dogma and contrasts by etymology with the God-written Decalogue.
4. **Dikaioma = context-dependent.** Singular articular = moral standard (Rom 8:4). Plural with carnal/service modifiers = ceremonial ordinances (Heb 9:1,10).
5. **Nomos = widest range.** Requires context for disambiguation; cannot be classified by the term alone.

### The Distinction Question

The textual data shows that NT authors do not use a single all-purpose term indiscriminately. The vocabulary distributes along consistent lines: entole for moral commands, dogma for what was abolished, dikaioma split by number and modifier. This is an observable pattern.

The question of whether this pattern was intentional or incidental is not answered by the text itself — that would require reading authorial intent. What the text provides is the distribution data.

### Counter-evidence to Evaluate

**1. Nomos is used for both categories.** This is true. Nomos has the widest range and appears in both continuation and cessation contexts. However, when nomos appears in a cessation context, it is either (a) qualified by additional terms (Eph 2:15: nomos + entolon + en dogmasin; Heb 7:16: nomon + entoles + sarkines) or (b) referring to the law-system generically, not to the Decalogue by name.

**2. Entole is not exclusive to moral law (Heb 7:16).** The text states that entole appears in a ceremonial context in Heb 7:16. The text also states that it carries the qualifier sarkines when it does so. The exception proves the qualifier-pattern: the author found it necessary to mark the ceremonial use.

**3. Dikaioma crosses categories.** True. Dikaioma appears in both moral (Rom 8:4) and ceremonial (Heb 9:1,10) contexts. However, the disambiguation markers (number, article, modifiers) are consistent. The term functions differently in each context, and those functional differences are signaled by grammar.

**4. The article pattern is grammatical, not theological.** This is a valid observation. Greek article usage follows grammar norms, and nomos as a monadic noun can be definite without the article. The article pattern is a tendency, not an absolute rule. It cannot be pressed into a rigid theological system.

**5. Cheirographon as debt certificate, not law code.** This alternative reading makes cheirographon a record of guilt rather than a law code. Even so, it does not identify cheirographon with the Decalogue.

---

## Focus Area Responses

### 1. Does entole correlate with moral/Decalogue content? When used for ceremonial (Heb 7:16), does a qualifier appear?

The text shows entole correlates with Decalogue/moral content in the majority of its NT occurrences. When entole appears in ceremonial contexts, qualifiers are present: sarkines in Heb 7:16, en dogmasin in Eph 2:15, contextual identification in Heb 7:5,18 (Levitical succession law). The qualifier pattern is consistent across multiple authors.

### 2. Is dogma NEVER used for moral law? Is it always ceremonial/governmental decrees?

The text shows dogma (all 5 NT occurrences) is never used for God's moral commandments. Its distribution: 2x Caesar's decrees, 1x apostolic council decrees, 2x abolished ceremonial material. This pattern extends to the LXX (royal decrees in Daniel and Esther).

### 3. Does cheirographon (Col 2:14) point to the Decalogue or to something else?

The text shows cheirographon means "hand-written" (cheir + grapho). The Decalogue was written by "the finger of God" (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10). A hand-written document is by definition not a God-written document. Additionally, cheirographon is paired with tois dogmasin (the ordinances/decrees), which are never used for the Decalogue. Whether cheirographon refers to the ceremonial law code or to a metaphorical debt certificate, neither reading identifies it with the Ten Commandments.

### 4. Does dikaioma split: singular = moral requirement (Rom 8:4), plural = ceremonial ordinances (Heb 9:1)?

The data shows a pattern: singular articular dikaioma in Rom 8:4 = "THE righteous requirement of THE law" (moral, unified standard); plural dikaiomata in Heb 9:1,10 = multiple "ordinances of divine service" / "carnal ordinances" (ceremonial, temporal). However, the plural also appears in non-ceremonial contexts (Rev 15:4; 19:8 = righteous acts/judgments). The split is not absolute (plural can mean "righteous deeds" generically), but within law-referent contexts, the singular/plural + modifier pattern holds.

### 5. When Paul uses nomos with article vs without, does it correlate with law-as-code vs law-as-principle?

The data shows a general tendency: articular ho nomos points toward the specific Mosaic law (code), while anarthrous nomos can function as law-as-principle or law-as-generic-concept. This is visible in Rom 4:15 where both appear in one verse. However, Greek grammar governs article usage by rules of definiteness, and nomos as a monadic noun can be definite without the article. The tendency exists but cannot be pressed into a rigid rule.

### 6. Overall: does the Greek vocabulary itself encode or support a moral/ceremonial distinction?

The vocabulary distribution data shows: (a) entole (unqualified) = moral commands across all NT authors; (b) dogma = never moral commands; (c) cheirographon = hand-written, paired with dogma; (d) dikaioma = split by number/article/modifier between moral and ceremonial referents; (e) nomos = widest range, requires context. This distribution is consistent with a moral/ceremonial distinction. Whether the distinction was encoded intentionally by the authors or is an emergent pattern of usage is not stated by the text.
