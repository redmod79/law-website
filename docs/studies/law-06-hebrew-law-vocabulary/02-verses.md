**Note:** Six terms in three couplets: torah/eduth (v.7), piqqudim/mitsvah (v.8), yirah/mishpatim (v.9). Each paired with a quality attribute (perfect/sure, right/pure, clean/true). All refer to one unified reality — "the law of the LORD."

### Psalm 119 — Sample Stanzas (8 law terms across 176 verses)

**Aleph (vv.1-8) — All 8 terms present:**
> 119:1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the **law** [H8451 torah] of the LORD.

**Note on Aleph stanza:** 7 of 8 terms appear (torah, edah, piqqud, choq, mitsvah, mishpat, choq again). The 8th term dabar ("word") appears elsewhere. "Statutes" (choq) appears twice (vv.5,8), suggesting these are not rigidly one-per-verse.

**Note:** 1 Kings 2:3 contains 6 law terms in one verse — mishmereth, chuqqah, mitsvah, mishpat, eduth — all said to be "written in the torah of Moses." Torah is the umbrella; the others are sub-categories.

### Deuteronomy 10:12-13; 11:1
> 10:12 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,

> 9:29 And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy **law** [H8451]: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy **commandments** [H4687], but sinned against thy **judgments** [H4941], (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
> 9:34 Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy **law** [H8451], nor hearkened unto thy **commandments** [H4687] and thy **testimonies** [H5715 eduth], wherewith thou didst testify against them.

## NT Greek Terms Mapping to Hebrew

### Romans 3:31
> Do we then make void the **law** [G3551 nomos] through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the **law** [G3551 nomos].

### Romans 7:7-12
> 7:7 What shall we say then? Is the **law** [G3551 nomos] sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the **law** [G3551]: for I had not known lust, except the **law** [G3551] had said, Thou shalt not covet.
> 7:8 But sin, taking occasion by the **commandment** [G1785 entole], wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the **law** [G3551] sin was dead.
> 7:9 For I was alive without the **law** [G3551] once: but when the **commandment** [G1785] came, sin revived, and I died.
> 7:10 And the **commandment** [G1785], which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.
> 7:11 For sin, taking occasion by the **commandment** [G1785], deceived me, and by it slew me.
> 7:12 Wherefore the **law** [G3551 nomos] is holy, and the **commandment** [G1785 entole] holy, and just, and good.

**Note:** Paul uses nomos and entole as distinct but related terms. He identifies a specific commandment (entole = "Thou shalt not covet" = Decalogue) within the broader nomos. This parallels the Hebrew torah/mitsvah relationship.

### 1 Corinthians 7:19
> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the **commandments** [G1785 entole] of God.

**Note:** Entole (commandments of God) is explicitly distinguished from circumcision. Since circumcision was a mitsvah/choq, this suggests entole here refers to the moral commandments, not the ceremonial ones.

### James 1:25; 2:8-12
> 1:25 But whoso looketh into the perfect **law** [G3551 nomos] of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
> 2:8 If ye fulfil the royal **law** [G3551 nomos] according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
> 2:9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the **law** [G3551] as transgressors.
> 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole **law** [G3551], and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.
> 2:11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the **law** [G3551].
> 2:12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the **law** [G3551 nomos] of liberty.

**Note:** James uses nomos and explicitly identifies it with the Decalogue (Do not commit adultery, Do not kill — commandments 7 and 6). He calls it the "royal law" and "law of liberty."

### Revelation 12:17; 14:12
> 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the **commandments** [G1785 entole] of God, and have the **testimony** [G3141 martyria] of Jesus Christ.
> 14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the **commandments** [G1785 entole] of God, and the faith of Jesus.

**Note:** Entole (commandments of God) used in an end-time context. The Greek entole maps primarily to Hebrew mitsvah in the LXX.
