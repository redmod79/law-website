# What Do the Hebrew Words for "Law" Actually Mean?

## A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence

---

### Introduction

When English Bibles say "law," a single word is doing the work of at least seven distinct Hebrew terms. The Old Testament uses *torah*, *mitsvah*, *choq*, *chuqqah*, *mishpat*, *eduth*, and *piqqud* -- each with its own root, meaning, and usage pattern. Understanding what these words actually mean, and how they relate to one another, sheds light on a central question: does the Hebrew vocabulary itself distinguish between "moral law" and "ceremonial law," or does it treat all of God's commands as a single undifferentiated category?

The answer is more nuanced than either side of the debate typically admits. The Hebrew terms describe the *formal character* of laws -- whether something was an instruction, a command, a decree, a judicial ruling, or a testimony -- not their *moral category*. No single Hebrew word means "moral law" or "ceremonial law." However, the terms are not interchangeable: they have distinct meanings, distribution patterns, and structural roles that are consistent with categorical distinctions, even if they do not name those categories outright.

## The Seven Major Law Terms and What They Mean

### Torah: "Instruction" -- Not Just "Law"

The most common Hebrew word translated "law" is *torah*, which appears 219 times in the Old Testament. The King James Version renders it as "law" 187 of those times, but this can be misleading. The root *yarah* means "to instruct" or "to direct." At its core, *torah* means "instruction" or "teaching."

> "The law [torah] of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple." (Psalm 19:7)

In legislative contexts, *torah* serves as the broadest umbrella term, containing other types of law within it:

> "And this is the law [torah] which Moses set before the children of Israel: These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments." (Deuteronomy 4:44-45)

The *torah* is presented as a container that unpacks into three sub-categories: testimonies, statutes, and judgments. It is the comprehensive term for the whole body of divine instruction.

### Mitsvah: "Command"

*Mitsvah* comes from a root meaning "to command" or "to give orders." It is translated "commandment" approximately 85% of the time. Like *torah*, it can serve as an umbrella term:

> "Now these are the commandments [mitsvah], the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you." (Deuteronomy 6:1)

The Greek translation of *mitsvah* -- *entole* -- becomes critical in the New Testament, where Paul writes:

> "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments [entole] of God." (1 Corinthians 7:19)

Paul dismisses a ceremonial rite while affirming the *entole* -- the Greek word that maps to Hebrew *mitsvah*. Even in Greek, the vocabulary could distinguish moral commands from ceremonial practices.

### Choq and Chuqqah: "Decree" or "Statute"

These related terms come from a root meaning "to cut in" or "to inscribe" -- something firmly established, decreed. *Choq* has an extraordinarily wide semantic range, with 55 different translations in the King James Version.

*Chuqqah* appears frequently in ceremonial feast legislation with the phrase "statute forever" (*chuqqat olam*):

> "And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance [chuqqah] for ever." (Exodus 12:14)

However, *chuqqah* is not exclusively ceremonial. It appears in Genesis 26:5 for Abraham's pre-Sinai obedience and in Leviticus 26:3 for comprehensive covenant faithfulness: "If ye walk in my statutes [chuqqot]." The word describes the form of a law -- a firm decree -- rather than its moral category.

### Mishpat: "Judgment" and "Case Law"

*Mishpat* has the widest semantic range of all Hebrew law terms: 133 unique translations in the King James Version and over 421 occurrences. The root *shaphat* means "to judge":

> "Now these are the judgments [mishpatim] which thou shalt set before them." (Exodus 21:1)

Nehemiah assigns a distinctive quality to each law term, showing they are not mere repetitions:

> "Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments [mishpatim], and true laws [torah], good statutes [chuqqim] and commandments [mitsvot]." (Nehemiah 9:13)

### Eduth: "Testimony" -- With a Special Connection to the Ten Commandments

*Eduth* means "testimony" or "witness" and has a unique distribution. In the Exodus narratives, it refers specifically and exclusively to the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments. The ark is called "the ark of the testimony." The tabernacle is "the tabernacle of the testimony." The tablets themselves are "tables of testimony":

> "And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God." (Exodus 31:18)

> "And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee." (Exodus 25:16)

No other law document receives the "testimony" designation in the narrative accounts. This creates a vocabulary link between *eduth* and the Decalogue that no other law term shares.

In the Psalms, however, *eduth* broadens to refer to God's revealed will generally:

> "The testimony [eduth] of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple." (Psalm 19:7)

This bimodal distribution -- specific to the Decalogue in narrative, broader in poetry -- is unique among the law terms.

### Piqqud: "Precept" -- A Devotional Term

*Piqqud* means "appointed charge" or "precept." Of its 24 total occurrences, 19 are in Psalm 119, with the rest in Psalms 19, 103, and 111. It never appears in any Pentateuchal legislation, prophets, wisdom literature, or historical books. It is purely devotional vocabulary -- a word the psalmists used when praising God's law in worship, not a term that appears in actual legal texts.

## How the Terms Work Together: Umbrella and Species

In legislative prose, these terms participate in a clear hierarchical structure. Both *torah* and *mitsvah* function as umbrella terms containing other categories. The most comprehensive vocabulary cluster appears in 1 Kings 2:3:

> "And keep the charge [mishmereth] of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes [chuqqot], and his commandments [mitsvot], and his judgments [mishpatim], and his testimonies [edot], as it is written in the law [torah] of Moses." (1 Kings 2:3)

Six law terms in one verse, all said to be "written in the torah of Moses." The *torah* is the ultimate container holding five sub-categories. This structured hierarchy demonstrates that the terms are not random synonyms.

## The Same Terms Behave Differently in Poetry

In devotional poetry, the same terms that show structural distinctions in legislation function as near-synonyms. Psalm 19:7-9 presents six terms in three elegant couplets:

> "The law [torah] of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony [eduth] of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes [piqqudim] of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment [mitsvah] of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear [yirah] of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments [mishpatim] of the LORD are true and righteous altogether." (Psalm 19:7-9)

Each term receives a quality (perfect, sure, right, pure, clean, true) and an effect (converting the soul, making wise, rejoicing the heart, enlightening the eyes, enduring forever, being righteous altogether). All are attributed to "the LORD" and praised equally.

Psalm 119 extends this devotional approach across 176 verses, using eight terms as variations on the theme of God's revealed will:

> "Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law [torah] of the LORD. Blessed are they that keep his testimonies [edot], and that seek him with the whole heart... O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes [chuqqim]! Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments [mitsvot]." (Psalm 119:1-2, 5-6)

This poetic usage does not contradict the legislative distinctions. Terms that carry precise functional meanings in legal prose are used more broadly in worship. This is a standard feature of any language -- technical terms used precisely in one genre can be employed loosely in another without erasing their technical meanings.

## From Hebrew to Greek: What Was Lost in Translation

When the Hebrew Old Testament was translated into Greek (the Septuagint), some vocabulary distinctions were preserved and others were compressed. Two mappings were stable:

- *Torah* became *nomos* ("law") -- 188 times
- *Mitsvah* became *entole* ("commandment") -- 153 times

Other terms fared less well. *Piqqud* was collapsed into *entole* -- the same Greek word used for *mitsvah* -- so Greek readers lost the Hebrew distinction between commands and precepts. *Choq* and *chuqqah* scattered across multiple Greek words with no single dominant equivalent. The catch-all Greek term *dikaioma* served as a secondary translation for seven different Hebrew law terms.

This compression meant that New Testament readers working in Greek had fewer vocabulary tools for distinguishing types of law than Hebrew readers had.

Despite this, Paul still shows awareness of Hebrew vocabulary structure. In Romans 7:7-12, he distinguishes between *nomos* (law generally) and *entole* (the specific commandment "Thou shalt not covet"):

> "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." (Romans 7:12)

## Abraham Before Sinai: A Revealing Test Case

Genesis 26:5 applies law vocabulary to a time centuries before Sinai:

> "Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge [mishmereth], my commandments [mitsvot], my statutes [chuqqot], and my laws [torot]." (Genesis 26:5)

Four of the major Hebrew law terms describe Abraham's pre-Sinai obedience. The same vocabulary used for Sinai legislation applies to obedience that predates it. This suggests these terms describe the formal character of divine instruction rather than being tied exclusively to a specific historical law code.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

**No Hebrew term means "moral law" or "ceremonial law."** Despite widespread assumptions, no single Hebrew word exclusively labels a category as moral or ceremonial. *Chuqqah* is used for both Passover observance (Exodus 12:14) and general covenant faithfulness (Leviticus 26:3). *Mitsvah* applies to both Decalogue commands (Deuteronomy 5:29) and commands generally. Each term's semantic range crosses what we think of as moral/ceremonial boundaries.

**The terms are not pure synonyms.** Legislative contexts demonstrate genuine structural differences: umbrella/species relationships, distinct distribution patterns, and different semantic ranges. In Deuteronomy, *torah* contains *edot*, *chuqqim*, and *mishpatim* as sub-categories. They are related but functionally distinct.

**The absence of a vocabulary label does not prove the absence of a distinction.** Some argue that because Hebrew lacks dedicated terms for "moral law" and "ceremonial law," no such distinction exists in Scripture. But the New Testament makes categorical distinctions without needing Hebrew vocabulary labels. Paul contrasts circumcision with "the commandments of God" in a single verse (1 Corinthians 7:19). Hebrews calls certain regulations "carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation" (Hebrews 9:10) while affirming God's laws written on hearts (Hebrews 10:16). The distinction is real even without a dedicated term.

**Distribution patterns are tendencies, not absolute boundaries.** While *chuqqah* concentrates in ceremonial feast legislation and *eduth* associates with the Decalogue in narrative, these are patterns, not rigid rules. Each term crosses the moral/ceremonial line at various points.

**The poetic synonymous usage does not cancel the legislative distinctions.** The fact that Psalm 119 uses eight law terms as near-synonyms does not mean the legislative distinctions in Deuteronomy are invalid. Different genres use vocabulary differently. Poetic parallelism uses terms interchangeably for literary effect; legislative prose uses the same terms with greater precision.

## Conclusion

The Hebrew law vocabulary consists of terms with genuine functional differences. *Torah* means "instruction" and serves as the broadest umbrella. *Mitsvah* means "command" and can also function comprehensively. *Choq/chuqqah* means "enacted decree." *Mishpat* means "judgment" or "case law." *Eduth* means "testimony" and has a unique association with the Ten Commandments in narrative contexts that no other law term shares. *Piqqud* means "appointed charge" and appears almost exclusively in devotional poetry.

These terms describe laws by their formal character rather than by moral category. The distribution patterns show real functional tendencies -- *chuqqah* concentrates in feast legislation, *mishpat* in case law, *eduth* in Decalogue contexts -- but they do not explicitly encode a moral/ceremonial taxonomy. They provide the building blocks from which categorical distinctions can be observed, but they do not name those categories.

The New Testament, working with Greek translations that compressed some Hebrew distinctions, still preserves the core *torah/nomos* and *mitsvah/entole* mappings. Paul explicitly differentiates between ceremonial rites and moral commandments in a single sentence (1 Corinthians 7:19). This demonstrates that categorical thinking about different types of law existed even when the vocabulary was more limited.

The Hebrew vocabulary neither proves nor disproves the moral/ceremonial distinction. It describes the formal types of divine instruction, leaving the question of internal categories to be answered by examining how the Bible *treats* different laws -- their delivery, purpose, duration, and New Testament application -- rather than by what they are *called*.
