## Question
What do torah, mitsvah, choq, mishpat, edut, piqqud, and chuqqah mean, and do they distinguish moral from ceremonial law?

---

## torah — [H8451](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8451/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}

**Original:** תּוֹרָה (towrah)
**Transliteration:** towrah / torah
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 219 (BLB) / 244 (search_strongs)
**Root:** From [H3384](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3384/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (yarah, "to throw, shoot, cast, pour; to direct, teach, instruct")
**Definition:** "A precept or statute, especially the Decalogue or Pentateuch: law" (Strong's). From the root meaning "to direct, instruct" — the basic sense is "instruction, direction, teaching."

### Translations (KJV)
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| the law | 60 | 24.6% |
| of the law | 28 | 11.5% |
| law | 24 | 9.8% |
| thy law | 20 | 8.2% |
| in the law | 19 | 7.8% |
| my law | 10 | 4.1% |
| (other) | ~83 | ~34% |

**KJV translation is dominated by "law" (187x total).** This obscures the original sense of "instruction/direction." The word encompasses everything from a single piece of instruction to the entire Pentateuch.

### Semantic Range
Torah functions at multiple levels in the OT:
1. **Specific instruction/teaching** — A single directive or piece of guidance (e.g., Prov 1:8 "the law [torah] of thy mother"; Prov 13:14 "the law [torah] of the wise")
2. **Body of legislation** — The collected laws given through Moses (e.g., Deut 4:44 "this is the torah which Moses set before the children of Israel")
3. **Umbrella term** — Torah as the genus containing species: Deut 4:44-45 names "the torah" (v.44), then enumerates it as edoth + chuqqim + mishpatim (v.45)
4. **The Pentateuch** — By metonymy, the five books of Moses (e.g., Luke 24:44 "in the law of Moses")

### Key Verses
- **Gen 26:5** — "and my laws [torotay]" — PLURAL form (rare!), suggesting multiple bodies of instruction
- **Deut 4:44** — "And this is the torah which Moses set before the children of Israel" — torah as umbrella for the entire body of law
- **Psa 19:7** — "The torah of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul" — torah as God's complete instruction
- **Psa 119:1** — "Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the torah of the LORD"
- **Psa 119:97** — "O how love I thy torah! it is my meditation all the day"
- **Isa 2:3** — "for out of Zion shall go forth the torah"
- **Jer 31:33** — "I will put my torah in their inward parts"

### LXX Connections
| Greek Term | Count | Score | Meaning |
|------------|-------|-------|---------|
| [G3551](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3551/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} nomos | 188x | 33.81 | Law, custom, principle |
| [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} entole | 23x | — | Commandment, injunction |
| [G975](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g975/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} biblion | 21x | — | Book, scroll |
| [G1345](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1345/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} dikaioma | 16x | — | Ordinance, righteous requirement |
| [G1125](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1125/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} grapho | 32x | — | Writing (= "the written law") |

**The LXX overwhelmingly renders torah as nomos (188x).** This is the Greek word used throughout the NT for "law." The secondary mapping to entole (23x) and dikaioma (16x) shows the LXX translators recognized torah could refer specifically to commandments or ordinances, not just "law" generically. The mapping to biblion and grapho reflects passages where torah means "the written book of the law."

### Distribution Pattern
Torah appears across the entire OT: heavily in Deuteronomy (22x), Psalms (esp. 119), Joshua, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra-Nehemiah, and the prophets. It is the broadest and most flexible of all the law terms.

### Morphological Notes
- Hebrew parsing of Gen 26:5 confirms PLURAL form: וְתֹורֹתָי (v'torotay, "and my instructions/laws") — Noun.fp+1us
- Hebrew parsing of Psa 19:7 confirms construct: תֹּורַת (torat, "instruction of") — Noun.fs.Cst
- Psalm 119 consistently uses singular torah

---

## mitsvah — [H4687](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4687/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}

**Original:** מִצְוָה (mitsvah)
**Transliteration:** mitsvah
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 181 (BLB) / 190 (search_strongs)
**Root:** From [H6680](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6680/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (tsavah, "to command, charge, give orders")
**Definition:** "A command, whether human or divine (collectively, the Law): commanded, commandment, law, ordinance, precept" (Strong's)

### Translations (KJV)
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| the commandments | 27 | 14.2% |
| his commandments | 24 | 12.6% |
| my commandments | 23 | 12.1% |
| thy commandments | 20 | 10.5% |
| the commandment | 14 | 7.4% |
| commandment | 10 | 5.3% |
| commandments | 9 | 4.7% |
| (other) | ~63 | ~33% |

**KJV translation is dominated by "commandment(s)" (~85% of occurrences).** This is one of the most consistently translated Hebrew law terms.

### Semantic Range
Mitsvah carries a clear sense of direct, authoritative command:
1. **Direct divine command** — An explicit order from God (e.g., Deut 5:31 "all the commandments")
2. **Umbrella term** — Like torah, mitsvah can function as a genus: Deut 6:1 "this is the mitsvah [singular!], the chuqqim and the mishpatim" — singular mitsvah as an umbrella broken into plural statutes and judgments
3. **Human commands** — Occasionally used for commands of kings or other authorities
4. **Collective for the Law** — The lexicon notes mitsvah can mean "collectively, the Law"

### Key Verses
- **Gen 26:5** — "my commandments [mitsvotay]" — Noun.fp+1us (PLURAL with 1st person suffix)
- **Deut 6:1** — "this is the commandment [hammitsvah], the statutes, and the judgments" — SINGULAR as umbrella
- **Psa 19:8b** — "the commandment [mitsvat] of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes" — singular construct
- **Psa 119:6** — "when I shall have respect unto all thy commandments [mitsvotekha]"
- **Ecc 12:13** — "Fear God, and keep his commandments [mitsvotav]"
- **1 Cor 7:19** — "keeping the commandments [entole] of God" — NT use of Greek equivalent

### LXX Connections
| Greek Term | Count | Score | Meaning |
|------------|-------|-------|---------|
| [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} entole | 153x | 34.01 | Commandment, injunction |
| [G5442](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5442/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} phylasso | 66x | — | To guard, keep, observe |
| [G1345](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1345/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} dikaioma | 27x | — | Ordinance, righteous requirement |
| [G1781](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1781/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} entellomai | 46x | — | To command, charge |

**Mitsvah maps strongly to entole (153x).** This is significant for NT interpretation: when the NT uses entole ("commandment"), the Hebrew background is predominantly mitsvah. The secondary mapping to phylasso (66x) reflects the common collocation "keep the commandments" (shamar + mitsvah). The mapping to dikaioma (27x) shows some overlap with the statute/ordinance domain.

### Distribution Pattern
Mitsvah appears across Pentateuch, Psalms, Proverbs, and Prophets. Used 20x in Psalm 119. Distributed broadly — not restricted to any single category of law.

### Morphological Notes
- Hebrew parsing of Deut 6:1 confirms singular with article: הַמִּצְוָה (hammitsvah) — Noun.fs (with article)
- Psalm 119:6 confirms plural with 2ms suffix: מִצְוֹתֶיךָ (mitsvotekha) — Noun.fp+2ms

## choq — [H2706](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2706/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}

**Original:** חֹק (choq)
**Transliteration:** choq
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 127 (BLB) / 134 (search_strongs)
**Root:** From [H2710](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2710/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (chaqaq, "to cut in, inscribe, decree")
**Definition:** "An enactment; hence, an appointment (of time, space, quantity, labor or usage): appointed, bound, commandment, convenient, custom, decree, due, law, measure, necessary, ordinance, portion, set time, statute, task" (Strong's)

### Translations (KJV)
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| the statutes | 14 | 10.4% |
| thy statutes | 14 | 10.4% |
| statutes | 13 | 9.7% |
| a statute | 7 | 5.2% |
| his statutes | 7 | 5.2% |
| by a statute | 5 | 3.7% |
| decree | 3 | 2.2% |
| a law | 2 | 1.5% |
| ordinances | 2 | 1.5% |
| due | 2 | 1.5% |
| a portion | 1 | 0.7% |
| a custom | 1 | 0.7% |
| bounds | 1 | 0.7% |
| set time | 1 | 0.7% |
| measure | 1 | 0.7% |

**Much wider semantic range than torah or mitsvah.** 55 unique translations. While "statute(s)" dominates (~50%), the range extends to "decree, portion, custom, bounds, set time, measure." The root meaning of "cutting/inscribing" suggests something engraved or fixed.

### Semantic Range
Choq has the widest semantic range of the core law terms:
1. **Enacted statute** — A prescribed regulation decreed by authority (e.g., Deut 4:45 "the statutes")
2. **Cosmic decree** — God's fixed boundaries for nature (e.g., Job 38:10 "set bars and doors"; Jer 5:22 "sand for the bound [choq] of the sea")
3. **Appointed portion** — A prescribed allotment (e.g., Gen 47:22 "a portion [choq] assigned them of Pharaoh"; Prov 30:8 "feed me with food convenient [choq] for me")
4. **Custom or practice** — An established pattern (e.g., Judg 11:39 "it was a custom [choq] in Israel")
5. **Set time** — An appointed period (e.g., Job 14:13 "appoint me a set time [choq]")
6. **Due or ration** — What is owed (e.g., Exo 5:14 "your task [choq] of bricks")

### Key Verses
- **Deut 4:45** — "the statutes [hachuqqim] and the judgments" — paired with mishpatim
- **Psa 119:5** — "O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes [chuqqekha]!"
- **Psa 119:8** — "I will keep thy statutes [chuqqekha]"
- **Jer 5:22** — "the sand for the bound [choq] of the sea" — cosmic decree sense
- **Job 38:33** — "Knowest thou the ordinances [chuqqot] of heaven?" — cosmic law
- **Psa 2:7** — "I will declare the decree [choq]: the LORD hath said unto me" — royal decree

### LXX Connections
| Greek Term | Count | Score | Meaning |
|------------|-------|-------|---------|
| [G1345](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1345/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} dikaioma | 52x | 25.04 | Ordinance, righteous requirement |
| [G3545](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3545/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} nomimos | 18x | — | Lawful, legitimate |
| [G5442](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5442/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} phylasso | 34x | — | To guard, keep |
| [G2917](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2917/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} krima | 23x | — | Judgment, decree |
| [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} entole | 22x | — | Commandment |

**No single dominant Greek equivalent.** Choq was rendered by 5 different Greek terms with significant frequency. Dikaioma leads (52x) but does not dominate the way nomos dominates for torah or entole dominates for mitsvah. This spread reflects the wide semantic range of choq.

### Distribution Pattern
Choq appears across Pentateuch, Psalms (28x in Psa 119), Job, Proverbs, and Prophets. Its use in both legislative contexts (statutes of Sinai) and cosmic contexts (decrees of nature) is significant — the same word describes both God's moral prescriptions and his physical ordinances for creation.

## chuqqah — [H2708](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2708/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}

**Original:** חֻקָּה (chuqqah)
**Transliteration:** chuqqah
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 104 (BLB) / 116 (search_strongs)
**Root:** Feminine form of [H2706](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2706/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (choq)
**Definition:** "Feminine of [H2706](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2706/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, and meaning substantially the same: appointed, custom, manner, ordinance, site, statute" (Strong's)

### Translations (KJV)
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| my statutes | 24 | 20.7% |
| a statute | 13 | 11.2% |
| in my statutes | 9 | 7.8% |
| the ordinances | 6 | 5.2% |
| his statutes | 6 | 5.2% |
| ordinance | 4 | 3.4% |
| statute | 4 | 3.4% |
| the ordinance | 3 | 2.6% |
| customs | 1 | 0.9% |

### Relationship to Choq (H2706)
The lexicon explicitly states chuqqah is "feminine of [H2706](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2706/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, and meaning substantially the same." Combined, choq and chuqqah account for approximately 235 occurrences. The masculine form (choq) is more common in Psalms, while the feminine form (chuqqah) is more common in Leviticus and Ezekiel for ritual prescriptions — though this distribution is not absolute.

### Key Verses
- **Gen 26:5** — "my statutes [chuqqotay]" — in the pre-Sinai vocabulary cluster
- **Exo 12:14** — "ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance [chuqqat] for ever" — Passover as chuqqah
- **Exo 12:17** — "therefore shall ye observe this day... by an ordinance [chuqqah] for ever" — Unleavened Bread as chuqqah
- **Exo 12:24** — "ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance [choq] to thee and to thy sons for ever"
- **Exo 12:43** — "This is the ordinance [chuqqat] of the passover" — Passover regulations
- **Lev 23:14,21,31,41** — Multiple feast observances called chuqqah
- **Lev 26:3** — "If ye walk in my statutes [b'chuqqotay]" — covenant blessing introduction
- **Lev 26:15** — "if ye shall despise my statutes [chuqqotay]" — covenant curse introduction
- **Lev 26:43** — "they despised my judgments, and their soul abhorred my statutes [chuqqotay]"
- **Lev 26:46** — "These are the statutes [hachuqqot] and judgments and laws [torot]" — closing summary

| [G4521](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4521/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} sabbaton | 7x | — | Sabbath |

**Notable: aionios (20x) and sabbaton (7x) in the LXX mappings.** The aionios mapping reflects the frequent "statute forever" (chuqqat olam) construction. The sabbaton mapping shows passages where chuqqah refers specifically to sabbath/feast observances. This LXX data confirms that chuqqah is prominently used for perpetual ritual observances.

### Distribution Pattern
Chuqqah is concentrated in Leviticus (especially chs. 18-26), Exodus 12 (Passover), Numbers, Deuteronomy, Ezekiel, and 2 Kings. Notable: heavily used for feast/sacrifice regulations ("chuqqat olam" = "statute forever" for Passover, Unleavened Bread, Day of Atonement, Feast of Tabernacles). This distribution differs from choq, which appears more in Psalms and wisdom literature.

## mishpat — [H4941](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4941/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}

**Original:** מִשְׁפָּט (mishpat)
**Transliteration:** mishpat
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 421 (BLB) / 448 (search_strongs)
**Root:** From [H8199](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8199/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (shaphat, "to judge, govern, vindicate")
**Definition:** "Properly, a verdict (favorable or unfavorable) pronounced judicially, especially a sentence or formal decree... including the act, the place, the suit, the crime, and the penalty; abstractly, justice, including a participant's right or privilege (statutory or customary), or even a style" (Strong's)

### Translations (KJV)
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| judgment | 69 | 15.4% |
| my judgments | 23 | 5.1% |
| of judgment | 21 | 4.7% |
| in judgment | 16 | 3.6% |
| the judgment | 15 | 3.3% |
| judgments | 15 | 3.3% |

| worthy | 4 | 0.9% |
| sentence | 2 | 0.4% |
| justice | 1 | 0.2% |
| law | 1 | 0.2% |

**Extremely wide semantic range: 133 unique translations.** This is the broadest of all 11 terms. The root meaning of "judging" extends to verdicts, rights, customs, manners, and standards.

### Semantic Range
Mishpat has the widest range of any Hebrew law term:
1. **Judicial verdict/ruling** — A judge's decision (e.g., Deut 17:11 "according to the sentence [mishpat] of the law... and according to the judgment [mishpat]")
2. **Case law** — Legal precedents and their prescribed penalties (e.g., Exo 21:1 "Now these are the judgments [mishpatim]" — introducing the Book of the Covenant case laws)
3. **Justice/rights** — Abstract justice or a person's legal rights (e.g., Isa 10:2 "turn aside the needy from judgment [mishpat]"; Jer 5:28 "the right [mishpat] of the needy")
4. **Custom/manner** — An established practice or procedure (e.g., 1 Sam 8:9 "the manner [mishpat] of the king"; 1 Ki 18:28 "after their manner [mishpat]")
5. **Standard/specification** — A prescribed plan or pattern (e.g., Exo 26:30 "according to the fashion [mishpat] thereof"; 1 Ki 6:38 "according to all the fashion [mishpat] of it")

### Key Verses
- **Exo 21:1** — "Now these are the judgments [hammishpatim] which thou shalt set before them" — introducing case laws
- **Deut 4:45** — "the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments [hammishpatim]" — as part of the law triad
- **Psa 19:9** — "the judgments [mishp'tey] of the LORD are true and righteous altogether"
- **Psa 119:7** — "when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments [mishpatey tsidqekha]"
- **Neh 9:13** — "Thou... gavest them right judgments [mishp'tey emet], and true laws [torot emet], good statutes [chuqqim tovim] and commandments [mitsvot]" — all 4 core terms in one verse, each with a quality adjective
- **Isa 42:1** — "he shall bring forth judgment [mishpat] to the Gentiles" — messianic justice

| [G2917](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2917/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} krima | 175x | 29.42 | Judgment, decision, verdict |
| [G2920](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2920/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} krisis | 132x | — | Judging, judgment, justice |

| [G5442](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5442/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} phylasso | 47x | — | To guard, keep |

**The judgment family dominates (krima 175x + krisis 132x = 307x).** But the righteousness/justice family is also strongly represented (dikaioma 63x + dikaiosyne 66x + dikaios 41x = 170x). This dual mapping reflects mishpat's dual meaning: both "judgment" (the act/verdict) and "justice/right" (the abstract principle).

### Distribution Pattern
Mishpat has the highest occurrence count (421-448x) of all the law terms. It appears across every major section of the OT. It is especially concentrated in: Exodus 21-23 (case law), Deuteronomy (paired with chuqqim), Psalms (esp. 119, with 23 occurrences), and the prophets (justice vocabulary).

## eduth — [H5715](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5715/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}

**Original:** עֵדוּת (eduth)
**Transliteration:** eduth
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 59 (BLB) / 66 (search_strongs)
**Root:** From [H5749](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5749/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (ud, "to bear witness, testify")
**Definition:** "Testimony: testimony, witness" (Strong's)

### Translations (KJV)
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| of the testimony | 15 | 22.7% |
| the testimony | 13 | 19.7% |
| of testimony | 8 | 12.1% |
| of witness | 4 | 6.1% |
| thy testimonies | 3 | 4.5% |
| his testimonies | 2 | 3.0% |
| a testimony | 2 | 3.0% |

**Narrow translation range: only 17 unique translations**, almost all "testimony/witness." This is one of the most consistently translated law terms.

### Semantic Range
Eduth has two primary domains:
1. **Tabernacle/Decalogue reference** — The stone tablets themselves and everything associated with them: "ark of the testimony" (aron ha'eduth), "tabernacle of the testimony" (mishkan ha'eduth), "tables of the testimony" (luchot ha'eduth). In these uses, eduth refers specifically to the Decalogue inscribed on the tablets.
2. **God's revealed will/law** — Used in Psalms as a near-synonym for God's law: "The testimony [eduth] of the LORD is sure" (Psa 19:7)

### Key Verses
- **Exo 25:16** — "thou shalt put into the ark the testimony [ha'eduth] which I shall give thee" — the stone tablets
- **Exo 25:21-22** — "thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony [ha'eduth]... I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony [ha'eduth]"
- **Exo 31:18** — "two tables of testimony [luchot ha'eduth], tables of stone, written with the finger of God"
- **Exo 32:15** — "the two tables of the testimony [ha'eduth] were in his hand"
- **Exo 34:29** — "the two tables of testimony [ha'eduth] in Moses' hand"
- **Exo 40:20** — "he took and put the testimony [ha'eduth] into the ark"
- **Psa 19:7** — "the testimony [eduth] of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple"

| [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} entole | 5x | — | Commandment |

**LXX mappings reveal dual distribution clearly.** Martyrion (53x) is the primary — "testimony, witness." But the secondary mappings are tabernacle furniture terms: kibotos (ark, 15x), skene (tabernacle, 18x), katapetasma (veil, 9x), hilasterion (mercy seat, 5x), plax (tablet, 3x). These secondary mappings reflect passages where "the eduth" metonymically refers to the tablets themselves or the furnishings that housed them. The entole mapping (5x) reflects Psalm passages where eduth functions as a law synonym.

### Distribution Pattern
Eduth has a distinctive bimodal distribution:
- **Exodus cluster:** Concentrated in Exo 16, 25-40 — almost always referring to the physical tablets or the tabernacle structures named after them
- **Psalms cluster:** Concentrated in Psa 19, 78, 93, 119, 122, 132 — used as a synonym for God's revealed will/law
- **Rare elsewhere:** Only scattered occurrences in Numbers, 2 Kings, 2 Chronicles, Isaiah

This distribution is significant: in narrative/legislative contexts, eduth refers specifically to the Decalogue tablets; in devotional/poetic contexts, it broadens to mean God's revealed will generally.

## edah — [H5713](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5713/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}

**Original:** עֵדָה (edah)
**Transliteration:** edah
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 26 (BLB) / 28 (search_strongs)
**Root:** Feminine of [H5707](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5707/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (ed, "witness") in its technical sense
**Definition:** "Feminine of [H5707](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5707/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} in its technical sense; testimony: testimony, witness. Compare [H5715](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5715/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}." (Strong's)

### Translations (KJV)
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| thy testimonies | 8 | 28.6% |
| a witness | 3 | 10.7% |
| his testimonies | 3 | 10.7% |
| Thy testimonies | 3 | 10.7% |
| the testimonies | 2 | 7.1% |
| and his testimonies | 2 | 7.1% |

### Relationship to Eduth (H5715)
The lexicon connects this term directly to [H5715](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5715/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} ("Compare [H5715](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5715/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}"). Both mean "testimony/witness," but their distributions differ:
- **Eduth (H5715):** Concentrated in Exodus tabernacle references
- **Edah (H5713):** Concentrated in Deuteronomy and Psalm 119

### Key Verses
- **Deut 4:45** — "These are the testimonies [ha'edot], and the statutes, and the judgments" — part of the law triad
- **Deut 6:17** — "Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies [edotav], and his statutes"
- **Deut 6:20** — "What mean the testimonies [ha'edot], and the statutes, and the judgments?"
- **Psa 119:2** — Uses edah (some occurrences in Psa 119 use this form rather than eduth)
- **Psa 25:10** — "All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies [edotav]"
- **Psa 93:5** — "Thy testimonies [edotekha] are very sure"
- **Psa 132:12** — "If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony [edotiy] that I shall teach them"

**Like eduth, edah maps primarily to martyrion.** The LXX translators did not consistently distinguish between [H5715](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5715/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} and [H5713](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5713/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}.

## piqqud — [H6490](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6490/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}

**Original:** פִּקּוּד (piqqud)
**Transliteration:** piqqud
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 24 (BLB) / 25 (search_strongs)
**Root:** From [H6485](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6485/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (paqad, "to attend to, visit, muster, appoint")
**Definition:** "Properly, appointed, i.e. a mandate (of God; plural only, collectively, for the Law): commandment, precept, statute" (Strong's)

### Translations (KJV)
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| thy precepts | 14 | 56.0% |
| his commandments | 2 | 8.0% |
| in thy precepts | 2 | 8.0% |
| The statutes | 1 | 4.0% |
| precepts | 1 | 4.0% |

**Dominated by "precepts" (17/25 = 68%).** This is the most narrowly translated of the law terms.

### Semantic Range
Piqqud has an extremely narrow semantic range:
1. **Used only in plural** — The lexicon explicitly notes "plural only." Never appears in singular form.
2. **Almost exclusively devotional/liturgical** — Not found in narrative or legislative texts. Restricted to Psalms.
3. **Meaning:** Appointed charges, mandates, precepts — things entrusted to someone's care

### Key Verses
- **Psa 19:8** — "The statutes [piqqudey] of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart" — KJV translates as "statutes" here, but this is piqqud not choq
- **Psa 103:18** — "to those that remember his commandments [piqqudav] to do them"
- **Psa 111:7** — "all his commandments [piqqudav] are sure"
- **Psa 119:4** — "Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts [piqqudekha] diligently"
- **Psa 119:15** — "I will meditate in thy precepts [piqqudekha]"
- **Psa 119:27** — "Make me to understand the way of thy precepts [piqqudekha]"
- **Psa 119:40** — "Behold, I have longed after thy precepts [piqqudekha]"
- **Psa 119:45** — "I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts [piqqudekha]"
- **Psa 119:56** — "This I had, because I kept thy precepts [piqqudekha]"
- **Psa 119:69** — "I will keep thy precepts [piqqudekha] with my whole heart"
- **Psa 119:78** — "I will meditate in thy precepts [piqqudekha]"
- **Psa 119:87** — "but I forsook not thy precepts [piqqudekha]"

- **Psa 119:168** — "I have kept thy precepts [piqqudekha] and thy testimonies"
- **Psa 119:173** — "for I have chosen thy precepts [piqqudekha]"

### LXX Connections

| [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} entole | 19x | 19.80 | Commandment, injunction |
| [G1345](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1345/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} dikaioma | 6x | — | Ordinance, righteous requirement |

**Small sample; entole dominates.** The LXX translators rendered piqqud as entole (commandment) — the same Greek word they used for mitsvah. This means the LXX did not preserve the Hebrew distinction between piqqud and mitsvah.

### Distribution Pattern — THE PIQQUD ANOMALY
This is one of the most distinctive distribution patterns among all law terms:
- 19 of 24 occurrences are in Psalm 119
- Remaining 5 are in Psa 19:8, Psa 103:18, Psa 111:7 (and possibly Num 31:21 variant)
- **Zero occurrences** in Pentateuchal legislation, prophets, wisdom literature, or historical books
- This is a devotional/liturgical term used by psalmists to describe God's law in worship contexts, NOT a legislative or juristic term

## mishmereth — [H4931](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4931/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}

**Original:** מִשְׁמֶרֶת (mishmereth)
**Transliteration:** mishmereth
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 78
**Root:** From [H8104](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8104/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (shamar, "to keep, guard, observe")
**Definition:** "Watch, i.e. the act (custody), or (concretely) the sentry, the post; objectively preservation, or (concretely) safe; figuratively observance, i.e. (abstractly) duty or (objectively) a usage or party: charge, keep, ordinance, safeguard, ward, watch" (Strong's)

### Translations (KJV)
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| the charge | 25 | 32.1% |
| to be kept | 5 | 6.4% |
| my charge | 4 | 5.1% |
| of the charge | 4 | 5.1% |
| the watch | 3 | 3.8% |
| ward | 2 | 2.6% |
| mine ordinance | 2 | 2.6% |

### Semantic Range
Mishmereth has a concrete-to-abstract range:
1. **Guard duty/watch post** — Physical sentry duty (e.g., 2 Ki 11:5 "the watch")
2. **Priestly/Levitical charge** — Duties assigned to priests and Levites (e.g., Num 3:25 "the charge of the sons of Gershon"; Num 18:3 "they shall keep thy charge")
3. **Obligation/duty** — A divinely imposed responsibility (e.g., Gen 26:5 "kept my charge [mishmarti]")
4. **Safeguard/safekeeping** — What is kept in trust (e.g., Exo 16:33 "to be kept [l'mishmereth]")

### Key Verses
- **Gen 26:5** — "kept my charge [mishmarti]" — Abraham's obedience. Noun.fs+1us.
- **1 Ki 2:3** — "keep the charge [mishmereth] of the LORD thy God" — David's charge to Solomon, followed by torah, mitsvah, chuqqah, mishpat
- **Deut 11:1** — "keep his charge [mishmarto], and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments" — part of 4-term cluster (mishmereth + choq + mishpat + mitsvah)
- **Lev 18:30** — "keep mine ordinance [mishmarti]" — general obligation to obey

### LXX Connections

| [G4633](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4633/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} skene | 17x | — | Tent, tabernacle |

**The guard/keep family dominates (phylake 41x + phylasso 40x = 81x).** This confirms the core meaning is "guarding, keeping watch over." The leitourgeo and ephemeria mappings reflect Levitical duty contexts.

### Distribution Pattern
Concentrated in Numbers (priestly/Levitical duties), Genesis-Deuteronomy (covenant vocabulary clusters), and 1-2 Chronicles (temple service). Mishmereth is often the first term in vocabulary clusters: Gen 26:5 begins with mishmereth; 1 Ki 2:3 begins with mishmereth; Deut 11:1 begins with mishmereth. It functions as "the overall obligation to keep" before specifying what is to be kept (torah, mitsvah, chuqqah, mishpat).

## dabar — [H1697](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1697/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}

**Original:** דָּבָר (dabar)
**Transliteration:** dabar
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Occurrences:** ~1439-1504
**Root:** From [H1696](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1696/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (dabar, "to speak, declare")
**Definition:** "A word; by implication, a matter (as spoken of) or thing; adverbially, a cause" (Strong's). Full range: "act, advice, affair, answer, book, business, case, cause, commandment, commune, counsel, decree, deed, due, duty, effect, errand, harm, hurt, iniquity, judgment, language, lying, manner, matter, message, oracle, ought, parts, please, portion, power, promise, provision, purpose, question, rate, reason, report, request, said, sake, saying, sentence, sign, so, some, song, speech, spoken, talk, task, thing, thought, tidings, what, which, word, work"

| the words | 140 | 9.3% |
| thing | 113 | 7.5% |

| of the acts | 44 | 2.9% |
| things | 42 | 2.8% |
| commandment | 8 | 0.5% |
| commandments | 3 | 0.2% |

**The most frequently occurring word in this study with 299 unique translations.** Dabar is by far the most general term — it means "word, thing, matter" broadly and only functions as a law term in specific contexts.

### Semantic Range
As a law term, dabar functions in specific contexts:
1. **God's spoken word** — Direct divine communication (e.g., "the word [dabar] of the LORD came to...")
2. **The Decalogue** — "the ten words [debarim]" = the Ten Commandments (Exo 34:28; Deut 4:13; 10:4)
3. **Psalm 119 usage** — "thy word [dabar]" as a synonym for God's law (e.g., Psa 119:9 "Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word [dabar]")
4. **General "thing/matter"** — Most occurrences are not law-related at all

### Key Verses (as law term)
- **Exo 34:28** — "he wrote upon the tables the words [dibrey] of the covenant, the ten commandments [lit. ten words/debarim]" — the Decalogue called "ten words"
- **Deut 4:13** — "he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments [lit. ten words/debarim]"
- **Psa 119:9** — "by taking heed thereto according to thy word [dabar]"
- **Psa 119:11** — "Thy word [dabar] have I hid in mine heart"
- **Psa 119:16** — "I will not forget thy word [dabar]"
- **Psa 119:25** — "quicken thou me according to thy word [dabar]"
- **Psa 119:42** — "for I trust in thy word [dabar]"
- **Psa 119:49** — "Remember the word [dabar] unto thy servant"
- **Psa 119:89** — "For ever, O LORD, thy word [dabar] is settled in heaven"
- **Psa 119:105** — "Thy word [dabar] is a lamp unto my feet"
- **Psa 119:130** — "The entrance of thy words [debarekha] giveth light"
- **Psa 119:160** — "Thy word [dabar] is true from the beginning"
- **Psa 119:169** — "give me understanding according to thy word [dabar]"

**Logos dominates (744x) with rhema as secondary (338x).** When the NT uses logos ("word") with reference to God's law, the Hebrew background is often dabar.

### Distribution Pattern
Dabar appears across the entire OT in massive numbers. As a law-specific term, its main concentration is in Psalm 119 (approximately 22 occurrences), Exodus 34:28/Deut 4:13/10:4 ("ten words" = Decalogue), and prophetic "word of the LORD" formulas.

## imrah — [H565](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h565/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}

**Original:** אִמְרָה (imrah)
**Transliteration:** imrah
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 37
**Root:** Feminine form related to [H561](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h561/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (emer, "speech, word")
**Definition:** "Commandment, speech, word" (Strong's)

### Translations (KJV)
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| thy word | 7 | 18.9% |
| according to thy word | 5 | 13.5% |
| the word | 4 | 10.8% |
| my speech | 3 | 8.1% |
| unto my speech | 2 | 5.4% |
| Thy word | 2 | 5.4% |
| in thy word | 2 | 5.4% |
| thy speech | 2 | 5.4% |
| his commandment | 1 | 2.7% |

### Semantic Range
Imrah is closely related to dabar but with a feminine form that emphasizes the spoken quality:
1. **God's spoken word/promise** — Especially in Psalms (e.g., Psa 119:11 "Thy word [imrah] have I hid in mine heart" — note: some Psa 119 verses use imrah while others use dabar)
2. **Human speech** — Occasionally for human words (e.g., Gen 4:23; Deut 32:2)
3. **Commandment** — Rarely, "his commandment" (1x)

### Key Verses (as Psalm 119 law term)
- **Psa 119:11** — "Thy word [imratekha] have I hid in mine heart"
- **Psa 119:38** — "Stablish thy word [imratekha] unto thy servant"
- **Psa 119:41** — "Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD... according to thy word [imratekha]"
- **Psa 119:103** — "How sweet are thy words [imratekha] unto my taste!"
- **Psa 119:140** — "Thy word [imratekha] is very pure"
- **Psa 119:148** — "Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word [imratekha]"
- **Psa 119:158** — "because they kept not thy word [imratekha]"
- **Psa 119:162** — "I rejoice at thy word [imratekha]"
- **Psa 119:170** — "deliver me according to thy word [imratekha]"
- **Psa 119:172** — "My tongue shall speak of thy word [imratekha]"

**Logion (25x) is the primary Greek equivalent** — meaning "oracle, divine utterance." This is distinct from dabar's mapping to logos. The LXX translators perceived imrah as specifically referring to divine oracular speech, not just "word" generically. The pyroo mapping (6x) reflects Psa 12:6 "The words [imrot] of the LORD are pure words... as silver tried in a furnace."

### Distribution Pattern
Imrah appears primarily in Psalms (especially 119, with approximately 19 occurrences) and Proverbs. It is the 8th term in the Psalm 119 vocabulary along with torah, mitsvah, choq, mishpat, edah, piqqud, and dabar.

## yirah — [H3374](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3374/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}

**Original:** יִרְאָה (yirah)
**Transliteration:** yirah
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 45
**Root:** Feminine of [H3373](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3373/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (yare, "fearing, afraid")
**Definition:** "Fear (also used as infinitive); morally, reverence: dreadful, exceedingly, fear(-fulness)" (Strong's)

### Translations (KJV)
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| the fear | 9 | 20.0% |
| The fear | 9 | 20.0% |
| in the fear | 5 | 11.1% |
| fear | 1 | 2.2% |
| Fearfulness | 1 | 2.2% |
| dreadful | 1 | 2.2% |

### The Yirah Anomaly in Psalm 19:9
Yirah is not a law term per se. It means "fear, reverence." However, in Psalm 19:9 (Heb. v.10), it appears in the sixth position of a six-term vocabulary describing God's revealed will:

| Verse | Term 1 | Quality | Effect |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|
| 19:7 | torah | perfect | converting the soul |
| 19:7 | eduth | sure | making wise the simple |
| 19:8 | piqqudim | right | rejoicing the heart |
| 19:8 | mitsvah | pure | enlightening the eyes |
| 19:9 | yirah | clean | enduring forever |
| 19:9 | mishpatim | true | righteous altogether |

In this poetic structure, yirah ("fear of the LORD") fills the same syntactic slot as the five explicit law terms. It functions as a metonymic substitute — "the fear of the LORD" represents the entire disposition of obedience and reverence that God's law produces, or the law viewed from the perspective of the human response it demands.

### Key Verses
- **Psa 19:9** — "The fear [yir'at] of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever" — used as a law-synonym
- **Psa 111:10** — "The fear [yir'at] of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom"
- **Prov 1:7** — "The fear [yir'at] of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge"
- **Prov 9:10** — "The fear [yir'at] of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom"
- **Isa 33:6** — "the fear [yir'at] of the LORD is his treasure"
- **2 Chr 19:9** — "Thus shall ye do in the fear [yir'at] of the LORD"

**Phobos dominates (31x).** But the secondary mappings to eusebeia (piety, 3x) and sophia (wisdom, 9x) are theologically significant — the LXX translators recognized that "fear of the LORD" carries connotations of piety/godliness and wisdom, not merely terror.

### Key LXX Observations

1. **Torah and mitsvah have distinct, stable Greek equivalents:** Torah maps to nomos (188x); mitsvah maps to entole (153x). The LXX translators maintained this distinction consistently.

2. **Piqqud loses its identity in Greek:** Piqqud maps to entole (19x) — the same Greek word used for mitsvah. The LXX collapses the Hebrew distinction between piqqud and mitsvah.

3. **Choq and chuqqah have no stable Greek equivalent:** Both map to dikaioma, nomimos, phylasso, and entole in varying proportions. The LXX translators did not have a single dedicated Greek term for the "enacted statute" concept.

4. **Mishpat maps to the judgment family:** Krima (175x) and krisis (132x) together account for the majority. The "judging" root meaning is preserved in Greek.

5. **Eduth maps uniquely:** Martyrion (testimony/witness) is the primary equivalent, distinguishing it clearly from all other law terms in Greek.

6. **Dikaioma (G1345) is the catch-all:** It appears as a secondary mapping for torah (16x), mitsvah (27x), choq (52x), chuqqah (35x), mishpat (63x), edah (4x), and piqqud (6x). This single Greek word absorbed the semantic range of multiple Hebrew terms, making NT Greek less precise than OT Hebrew for law vocabulary.

## Vocabulary Cluster Patterns

### The Standard Deuteronomic Cluster
Deuteronomy uses a recurring formula combining multiple law terms. The most common patterns:

| Passage | Terms Used |
|---------|-----------|
| Deut 4:44-45 | torah (umbrella) → edot + chuqqim + mishpatim |
| Deut 5:31 | mitsvot + chuqqim + mishpatim |
| Deut 6:1 | mitsvah (singular umbrella) → chuqqim + mishpatim |
| Deut 6:17 | mitsvot + edot + chuqqim |
| Deut 6:20 | edot + chuqqim + mishpatim |
| Deut 7:11 | mitsvot + chuqqim + mishpatim |
| Deut 10:12-13 | mitsvot + chuqqim |
| Deut 11:1 | mishmereth + chuqqim + mishpatim + mitsvot |
| Deut 26:16 | chuqqim + mishpatim |

**Observations:**
- The triad chuqqim + mishpatim appears most frequently
- Torah and mitsvah (singular) function as umbrella terms
- Edot appears less frequently in Deuteronomy clusters
- Mishmereth appears as an introductory "overall charge" term

### The Genesis 26:5 Cluster (Pre-Sinai)
mishmereth + mitsvot + chuqqot + torot (PLURAL!)

This is the only passage that uses PLURAL torah. Four law terms applied to Abraham's obedience before Sinai legislation existed.

### The 1 Kings 2:3 Cluster (Post-Solomonic)
mishmereth + torah + mitsvot + chuqqot + mishpatim

David's deathbed charge to Solomon — the most complete 5-term cluster in the OT.

### The Nehemiah 9:13 Cluster (Post-Exilic)
mishpatim + torot + chuqqim + mitsvot (each qualified: "right," "true," "good," "good")

This passage is remarkable because it assigns quality adjectives to each term, suggesting the author viewed them as distinct categories worth individual description.

### The Psalm 19:7-9 Cluster (Poetic)
torah + eduth + piqqudim + mitsvah + yirah + mishpatim

Six terms in three paired couplets, each with a quality and an effect on the hearer. This is the densest poetic cluster, using terms from multiple semantic domains.

### The Psalm 119 Vocabulary (Devotional)
Eight terms used across 176 verses: torah, mitsvah, choq, mishpat, edah, piqqud, dabar, imrah

The Aleph stanza (vv.1-8) alone uses 6 of the 8 terms:
- v.1: torah
- v.2: edah
- v.4: piqqud
- v.5: choq
- v.6: mitsvah
- v.7: mishpat
- v.8: choq (repeated)

Terms absent from Aleph: dabar and imrah (both appear in other stanzas)

## Observation Notes for Analysis Agent

The following patterns emerge from the data but are left for the analysis agent to evaluate:

1. **Umbrella/species pattern:** Both torah (Deut 4:44-45) and mitsvah (Deut 6:1) function as singular umbrella terms that are then broken into plural sub-categories (chuqqim + mishpatim, edot + chuqqim + mishpatim). This raises the question: are these terms taxonomic categories or rhetorical fullness?

2. **Distribution distinctives:** Some terms have highly distinctive distributions:
   - piqqud: Psalms only (devotional)
   - eduth: Exodus tabernacle + Psalms (bimodal)
   - mishpat: broadest distribution, heaviest in case-law and prophets
   - chuqqah: concentrated in Leviticus feast/sacrifice regulations

3. **LXX compression:** Greek has fewer distinct terms than Hebrew for law vocabulary. Dikaioma serves as a catch-all. This means NT readers working from the LXX or in Greek-speaking contexts would not have had the same vocabulary precision as Hebrew readers.

4. **Poetic parallelism vs. precision:** In Psalm 19 and Psalm 119, the terms appear in synonymous parallelism. The question is whether parallelism implies synonymity or whether distinct terms can be parallel while retaining distinct nuances.

5. **The moral/ceremonial question:** The data shows chuqqah is heavily used for feast/ritual observances (Exo 12, Lev 23), while mishpat is heavily used for case-law and justice. But both terms also appear in passages that mix moral and ceremonial content. The Hebrew vocabulary does not draw a clean line labeled "moral" vs. "ceremonial."

6. **The eduth/Decalogue connection:** Eduth in narrative contexts (Exodus) refers specifically to the Decalogue tablets. In poetic contexts (Psalms), it broadens. Law-03 found this pattern; the data here confirms it.

7. **Pre-Sinai vocabulary in Gen 26:5:** All four terms used for Abraham's obedience (mishmereth, mitsvot, chuqqot, torot) also appear in Sinai-era legislation, suggesting continuity of concept.
