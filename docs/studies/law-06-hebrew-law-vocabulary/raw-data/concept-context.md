## Genesis 26:5 — Concept Context
```
"Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
Book: Genesis | Chapter: 26 | Author: Moses

CONCEPTS IN THIS VERSE:
  OBEDIENCE: Shama/hypakouo - hear, obey, listen
    Strong's: H8085 (obeyed)
  LAW: Torah, commandments, statutes, ordinances
    Strong's: H4687, H8451 (my commandments, and my laws)

SAME BOOK (Genesis):
  Genesis 18:19 [LAW] — "For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment"
  Genesis 18:25 [LAW] — "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
  Genesis 16:2 [OBEDIENCE] — "And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai"
  Genesis 21:12 [OBEDIENCE] — "hearken unto her voice"

SAME AUTHOR (Moses):
  Deuteronomy 11:13 [LAW, OBEDIENCE] — "if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments"
  Deuteronomy 11:27 [LAW, OBEDIENCE] — "A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God"
  Deuteronomy 11:28 [LAW, OBEDIENCE] — "And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments"
  Deuteronomy 1:17 [LAW, OBEDIENCE] — "ye shall hear the small as well as the great"
```

KEY OBSERVATION: Gen 26:5 is unusual because it uses the full vocabulary cluster (mishmereth, mitsvah, chuqqah, torah) in a pre-Sinai context, referring to Abraham. Concept context confirms this links thematically to Deuteronomy's vocabulary cluster passages.

## Deuteronomy 6:1 — Concept Context (--limit 30)
```
"Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:"

  JUDGMENT: Mishpat/krisis - justice, verdict, decision
    Strong's: H4941 (and the judgments)

    Strong's: H6213 (that ye might do)

  6:25 [FULFILLMENT, LAW] — "And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments"
  6:2 [LAW] — "to keep all his statutes and his commandments"

SAME BOOK (Deuteronomy) — top matches with all 4 concepts:
  12:1 [FULFILLMENT, INHERITANCE, JUDGMENT, LAW] — "These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land"
  4:1 [FULFILLMENT, INHERITANCE, JUDGMENT, LAW] — "hearken unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them"
  4:14 [FULFILLMENT, INHERITANCE, JUDGMENT, LAW] — "commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments"

  11:1 [JUDGMENT, LAW] — "keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments"
```

KEY OBSERVATION: The concept context for Deut 6:1 reveals that the triad "commandments + statutes + judgments" (mitsvah + choq + mishpat) appears throughout Deuteronomy in nearly identical formulations. Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 26, 30 all use this same cluster, confirming it is a standard Deuteronomic formula rather than a precision taxonomy.

## Psalm 19:8 (English 19:7) — Concept Context
```
"The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes."
(Note: Heb 19:8 = English 19:8, which is the piqqud/mitsvah verse)
Book: Psalm | Chapter: 19 | Author: Unknown

CONCEPTS IN THIS VERSE:
  LAW: Torah, commandments, statutes, ordinances
    Strong's: H6490, H4687 (The statutes, the commandment)
  RIGHTEOUSNESS: Tsedaqah/dikaiosyne - rightness, justice, right standing

SAME BOOK (Psalm) — key parallels:

  94:15 [HEART, LAW, RIGHTEOUSNESS] — "judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it"
  119:142 [LAW, RIGHTEOUSNESS] — "Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth"
  119:160 [LAW, RIGHTEOUSNESS] — "every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever"
```

KEY OBSERVATION: Psalm 19:7-9 uses 6 different terms for God's revealed will (torah, eduth, piqqudim, mitsvah, yirah, mishpatim) in 3 paired couplets, each with a quality and an effect. The concept context links this directly to Psalm 119's expanded treatment of the same vocabulary.
