# Analysis: Is the Seventh-Day Sabbath Still Binding Today?

## Study: law-27 (Capstone Sabbath Study)
## Date: 2026-02-26

This study compiles and synthesizes evidence from studies law-13 (Jesus and Sabbath), law-24 (Weekly vs. Ceremonial Sabbaths), law-25 (Sabbath Moral or Ceremonial), law-26 (Sabbath Shadow Passages), and additional evidence about apostolic practice, prophecy, and the first-day-of-the-week passages. This is the capstone Sabbath study in the Law of God series.

## Category 1: Creation Origin

### What the Text Says

Genesis 2:2-3 states: "On the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."

Three divine actions are recorded: God rested (shabath, H7673), blessed (barakh), and sanctified (qadash, H6942) the seventh day. These actions occurred at creation -- before the fall, before Israel existed, before Sinai.

Exodus 20:8-11 (the Fourth Commandment) cites the creation event as its own rationale: "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."

Mark 2:27 states: "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath." The Greek word is anthropos (G444), denoting humanity generically, not a specific ethnic group.

*(Examined in depth in law-02-law-before-sinai and law-25-sabbath-moral-or-ceremonial.)*

### Analysis

The text presents the Sabbath as a creation institution, established by divine action before sin entered the world and before any ethnic or national identity existed. The Fourth Commandment's rationale explicitly points to creation, not to the Exodus or any ceremonial arrangement. The verb zakar ("remember," H2142) opening the Fourth Commandment is an Infinitive Absolute -- the most emphatic Hebrew verb form -- and is a memorial verb pointing backward to a completed past event.

The Continues position infers from this that a creation institution is by nature universal and permanent, not limited to a particular people or dispensation. The Abolished position does not dispute that Genesis records these actions but infers that the Sabbath was not enjoined as a command until Sinai.

---

## Category 2: Decalogue Membership

### What the Text Says

The Sabbath command is the fourth of the Ten Commandments (Exo 20:8-11; Deu 5:12-15). The Decalogue was:
- Spoken directly by God's voice to the people (Deu 5:22: "with a great voice: and he added no more")
- Written by God's finger on two tablets of stone (Exo 31:18; Deu 9:10)
- Placed inside the Ark of the Covenant (Deu 10:5; 1 Ki 8:9)

These features distinguish the Decalogue from all other biblical legislation, which was delivered through Moses as mediator, written in a book/scroll, and placed beside the Ark (Deu 31:26).

*(Examined in depth in law-01-gods-moral-law and law-03-exodus-20-vs-later-laws.)*

### Analysis

The Sabbath command shares all seven unique markers identified for the Decalogue in law-01. The text does not provide any indicator that the fourth commandment has a different status from the other nine. The Continues position observes that the Sabbath's inclusion in the Decalogue places it in the moral-law category by the Bible's own classification system. The Abolished position infers that the Decalogue is not a separate moral category but part of a single undivided law.

---

## Category 3: Leviticus 23 Separation (Weekly vs. Ceremonial Sabbaths)

### What the Text Says

Leviticus 23:3 lists the weekly Sabbath first, then v.4 begins: "These are the feasts of the LORD." Verse 38 states that all the preceding festival observances are "beside the sabbaths of the LORD" (millibad, [H4480](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4480/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}+[H905](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h905/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- "apart from/besides"). The weekly Sabbath has distinct vocabulary: shabbath shabbathon (Lev 23:3) with "all work" prohibition, whereas annual rest days use shabbathon alone with "servile work" prohibition.

Numbers 28-29 organizes offerings by temporal frequency, placing the weekly Sabbath (Num 28:9-10) in its own category between the daily offering and the monthly new moon offering.

The weekly Sabbath is never called a moed (H4150, "appointed feast") or chag (H2282, "festival") in the Old Testament.

*(Examined in depth in law-24-weekly-sabbath-vs-ceremonial-sabbaths.)*

### Analysis

The text of Leviticus 23:38 explicitly uses millibad to separate the weekly Sabbath from the annual festivals. The vocabulary, temporal structure, and literary placement all distinguish the two categories. The Continues position observes that the Bible itself separates the weekly Sabbath from the ceremonial sabbaths. The Abolished position infers that all sabbaths belong to a single category.

## Category 4: Jesus's Teaching and Practice

### What the Text Says

Luke 4:16 states: "And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was [kata to eiothos, G1486, Perfect Active Participle], he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day."

The Perfect tense of eiothos indicates a settled, completed habit with ongoing results -- not an occasional occurrence but an established pattern.

Jesus declared: "The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath" (Mrk 2:28). He stated: "It is lawful [exestin, G1832] to do well on the sabbath days" (Mat 12:12). Every Sabbath controversy in the Gospels operates within the exesti ("is it lawful?") framework -- debating WHAT is lawful on the Sabbath, not WHETHER the Sabbath has binding force.

Jesus reformed Sabbath observance from Pharisaic additions (Mrk 2:23-28; Luk 13:10-17; Jhn 5:5-14) but made no statement that the Sabbath itself was to cease.

*(Examined in depth in law-13-jesus-and-sabbath.)*

### Analysis

The text presents Jesus as a habitual Sabbath observer who claimed lordship over the Sabbath and who operated within the framework of "what is lawful" on the Sabbath. The Continues position observes that Jesus's actions demonstrate Sabbath continuity. The Abolished position does not dispute Jesus's Sabbath observance during His life but infers that His death changed the status of the Sabbath.

---

## Category 5: Post-Crucifixion Evidence

### A. Luke 23:56 -- "According to the Commandment"

**What the Text Says:**

Luke 23:56 states: "And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment [kata ten entolen, G1785]."

The Greek uses the definite article ten ("the") before entolen ("commandment"), specifying a particular, known commandment -- the Fourth Commandment. This is written by Luke after the crucifixion. Luke uses hesychasan (G2270, Aorist Active Indicative -- "they rested," a completed definitive action) to describe what the women did on the Sabbath.

Luke does not add any qualifier indicating that the commandment had changed or was about to change. Luke 24:1 then records that "upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre" -- they waited until after the Sabbath.

**Analysis:**

Luke writes this description after the crucifixion and identifies the women's Sabbath rest as being "according to THE commandment." Luke is the same author who will record extensive apostolic Sabbath practice in Acts. The Continues position observes that Luke treats the Fourth Commandment as operative after the cross. The Abolished position infers that the women were acting out of prior habit, not recognizing the change that had occurred.

### B. Matthew 24:20 -- Jesus's Prophecy About the Sabbath After the Cross

**What the Text Says:**

Matthew 24:20 states: "But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day."

The context (Mat 24:1-3, 15-21) is Jesus's prophecy about the destruction of Jerusalem, which occurred in AD 70 -- approximately 40 years after the crucifixion. The verb proseuchesthe (G4336) is a Present Middle/Passive Imperative -- a continuous command: "keep praying." The conjunction mede ("nor") pairs winter and the Sabbath day as equally significant concerns for the flight.

**Analysis:**

Jesus instructs His followers to pray about the Sabbath in the context of an event decades after His death. The text does not contain any indicator that Jesus expects the Sabbath to lose its significance before AD 70. The Continues position observes that Jesus presupposes ongoing Sabbath observance by His followers long after the cross. The Abolished position infers that Jesus is referring to practical concerns about Jewish customs (closed gates on the Sabbath) rather than affirming the Sabbath's binding nature.

---

## Category 6: Apostolic Sabbath Practice in Acts

### What the Text Says

**Acts 13:14, 42, 44 (Antioch of Pisidia):** Paul and Barnabas entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day. After Paul's sermon, "the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath" (v.42). "The next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God" (v.44).

**Acts 15:21 (Jerusalem Council):** James states: "For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day."

**Acts 16:13 (Philippi):** "On the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made." There was no synagogue in Philippi; Paul sought Sabbath worship by the riverside.

**Acts 17:1-2 (Thessalonica):** "Paul, as his manner was [kata to eiothos], went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures." Luke uses the identical Greek construction (kata to eiothos, [G1486](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1486/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, Perfect Active Participle) for Paul as he used for Jesus in Luke 4:16.

**Acts 18:4, 11 (Corinth):** "He reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath [kata pan sabbaton], and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks." The verb dielegeto (G1256, Imperfect Middle/Passive Indicative) indicates ongoing, habitual action. Paul's time in Corinth was "a year and six months" (v.11) -- approximately 78 Sabbaths of teaching Jews AND Greeks.

### Analysis

Luke documents Paul's Sabbath practice across multiple cities over multiple years. The cumulative record includes:

| Location | Reference | Duration/Count | Audience |
|----------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Antioch of Pisidia | Acts 13:14, 42, 44 | At least 2 Sabbaths | Jews, then "almost the whole city" |
| Philippi | Acts 16:13 | At least 1 Sabbath | Women at riverside (no synagogue) |
| Thessalonica | Acts 17:2 | 3 Sabbaths | Jews and devout Greeks |
| Corinth | Acts 18:4, 11 | ~78 Sabbaths (18 months) | Jews AND Greeks |

The eiothos connection is textually verified: the same author (Luke) uses the same grammatical construction (kata to eiothos, Perfect Active Participle of G1486) for both Jesus (Luk 4:16) and Paul (Acts 17:2). This is not a cross-referencing inference but an observable same-author, same-vocabulary pattern.

Acts 16:13 is significant because Philippi had no synagogue. Paul's Sabbath observance at the riverside demonstrates that his Sabbath practice was not merely a Jewish-evangelism strategy; he sought Sabbath worship even where there was no Jewish congregation.

The Continues position observes that the apostolic pattern of Sabbath observance is consistent and includes Gentile audiences. The Abolished position infers that Paul used the synagogue as a strategic platform for evangelism, not because he personally affirmed the Sabbath.

---

## Category 7: Hebrews 4:9 -- sabbatismos Remains

### What the Text Says

Hebrews 4:9 states: "There remaineth therefore a rest [sabbatismos, G4520] to the people of God."

The author of Hebrews uses katapausis (G2663, "rest") eight times in Hebrews 3-4 (Heb 3:11, 18; 4:1, 3, 5, 10, 11) and then switches to sabbatismos (G4520) once, in Heb 4:9. sabbatismos is a hapax legomenon (occurs only once in the NT). The -ismos suffix in Greek denotes practice or observance (compare: baptismos = practice of baptizing).

The verb apoleipetai (G620) is Present Passive Indicative, 3rd person singular -- "is currently being left remaining." The present tense indicates an ongoing state at the time of writing, not a future-only reality. The passive voice indicates something done TO the sabbatismos -- it is left remaining by God.

The logic flow of Hebrews 4 is:
1. God rested on the seventh day (v.4, quoting Gen 2:2)
2. The Israelites under Joshua did not enter God's rest due to unbelief (v.6, 8)
3. If Joshua had given them the ultimate rest, God would not have spoken of "another day" (v.8)
4. Therefore (ara) a sabbatismos remains for the people of God (v.9)
5. The one who enters God's rest ceases from his own works, as God did from His (v.10)

*(Examined in depth in law-13-jesus-and-sabbath and law-25-sabbath-moral-or-ceremonial.)*

### Analysis

The deliberate word switch from katapausis (8 uses) to sabbatismos (1 use) is observable. The -ismos suffix denoting practice is a standard Greek morphological feature. The present tense of apoleipetai is a grammatical fact. These are not interpretive claims but textual observations.

The Continues position observes that the text says a "Sabbath-keeping" (not merely a "rest") is currently remaining for the people of God, and that the argument is grounded in God's creation rest (Gen 2:2). The Abolished position infers that sabbatismos refers to a spiritual rest in Christ, not a literal seventh-day observance.

---

## Category 8: Prophetic Continuity

### A. Isaiah 66:22-23 -- Sabbath in the New Earth

**What the Text Says:**

Isaiah 66:22-23 states: "For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD."

The Hebrew idiom middey shabbat beshabbatto = "from sabbath to its sabbath" = every week (distributive). "All flesh" (kol-basar) = universal scope. The context is the new heavens and new earth (v.22).

*(Examined in depth in isaiah-66-new-moon-sabbath study.)*

### B. Isaiah 56:1-8 -- Sabbath Universal Scope

**What the Text Says:**

Isaiah 56:2 states: "Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil."

Isaiah 56:6-7 states: "Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; even them will I bring to my holy mountain."

Isaiah 56:8 adds: "The Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him."

The term "sons of the stranger" (beney hannekar) refers to non-Israelites/foreigners. Sabbath-keeping is paired with general moral conduct ("keepeth his hand from doing any evil"). The text promises blessings to these foreigners and states God will "gather others" beyond Israel.

### C. Isaiah 58:13-14 -- God's Standard for Sabbath Observance

**What the Text Says:**

Isaiah 58:13 states: "If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable."

God calls the Sabbath "my holy day" and "the holy of the LORD."

### Analysis

Isaiah prophesies Sabbath observance in three settings: (a) by foreigners who join themselves to the LORD (Isa 56:6-7), (b) as God's standard for right living (Isa 58:13-14), and (c) in the new heavens and new earth (Isa 66:22-23). The creation-to-new-creation arc is observable: established at creation (Gen 2:2-3), codified in the Decalogue (Exo 20:8-11), prophesied in the new earth (Isa 66:23).

The Continues position observes that the Sabbath spans the entire biblical timeline from creation to the new earth. The Abolished position infers that the Isaiah prophecies use Sabbath language figuratively to represent worship in general, or that they reflect Old Testament language projected onto future realities without implying literal seventh-day observance.

---

## Category 9: The Sabbath as Perpetual Sign and Covenant

### What the Text Says

Exodus 31:13 states: "Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign [oth, H226] between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you."

Exodus 31:16 states: "Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant [berit olam]."

Exodus 31:17 states: "It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever [le-olam]: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed."

Ezekiel 20:12 states: "Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify [meqaddisham, Piel Participle -- ongoing sanctifying action] them."

Ezekiel 20:20 states: "And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God."

### Analysis

The text designates the Sabbath as berit olam ("perpetual/everlasting covenant") and oth le-olam ("sign forever"), with the creation event cited as the rationale (Exo 31:17). The Piel participle meqaddisham in Eze 20:12 indicates ongoing, continuous sanctifying action.

The Continues position observes that "perpetual covenant" and "sign forever" grounded in creation indicate permanence. The Abolished position infers that "children of Israel" limits the sign to ethnic Israel and that olam can mean "age-long" rather than eternal in some contexts.

---

## Category 10: End-Time Commandment-Keeping

### What the Text Says

Revelation 14:12 states: "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments [entolas, G1785] of God, and the faith of Jesus."

Revelation 12:17 states: "The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments [entolas] of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."

Revelation 22:14 states: "Blessed are they that do his commandments [entolas], that they may have right to the tree of life."

### Analysis

Revelation identifies end-time saints by two markers: keeping God's commandments (entolas tou theou) and having faith in/testimony of Jesus. entole (G1785) unqualified with "of God" consistently refers to the moral law in NT usage (per law-20, law-21 vocabulary studies).

The Continues position observes that the Sabbath is the Fourth Commandment and that if end-time saints are defined by commandment-keeping, the Sabbath is included. The Abolished position infers that "commandments of God" in Revelation refers to new covenant commands, not the Decalogue.

---

## Category 11: Objection Passages -- Already Analyzed

### A. Colossians 2:14-17

**What the Text Says:**

Col 2:14 states: "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances [cheirographon tois dogmasin] that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross."

Col 2:16-17 states: "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow [skia, G4639] of things to come."

*(Examined in depth in law-26-sabbath-shadow-passages.)*

The cheirographon ("handwriting") is a hand-written document (cheir = hand + grapho = write). The Decalogue was written by God's finger, not by a human hand. The word dogmasin ("ordinances/decrees") in NT usage applies to ceremonial regulations (Eph 2:15), never to the Decalogue.

The triad "holyday / new moon / sabbath days" matches the OT ceremonial triad found in 1 Chr 23:31; 2 Chr 2:4; 2 Chr 31:3; Neh 10:33; Eze 45:17; and Hos 2:11. In all OT occurrences, this triad refers to the ceremonial calendar system.

skia ("shadow") in all three NT theological uses (Col 2:17; Heb 8:5; Heb 10:1) is applied to the ceremonial/typological system, not to the Decalogue.

### B. Romans 14:5

**What the Text Says:**

Rom 14:5 states: "One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind."

*(Examined in depth in law-26-sabbath-shadow-passages.)*

The word sabbaton does not appear in Romans 14. The context (Rom 14:1) is "doubtful disputations" -- matters of personal conscience, not matters of moral obligation. The passage discusses eating practices, fast days, and similar matters.

### C. Galatians 4:9-10

**What the Text Says:**

Gal 4:9-10 states: "But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years."

*(Examined in depth in law-26-sabbath-shadow-passages.)*

The word sabbaton does not appear in Galatians. The context of Galatians is the circumcision controversy (Gal 2:3-5; 5:2-6; 6:12-15). The Galatian converts were Gentiles turning to Jewish ceremonial requirements (circumcision and its associated ritual obligations), not to the Decalogue.

### Analysis of Objection Passages

None of the three passages cited as evidence for Sabbath abolition contains the word sabbaton with a definitive reference to the weekly seventh-day Sabbath. Colossians 2:16 uses "sabbath days" (sabbaton) in a ceremonial triad context; Romans 14:5 does not name any specific day; Galatians 4:10 does not use sabbaton at all.

---

## Category 12: First-Day-of-the-Week Passages

### What the Text Says

**Acts 20:7:** "And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight."

This is a single event narrative. Paul "was ready to depart on the morrow" (v.7) and traveled on foot to Assos the next day (v.13-14). Breaking bread is not limited to Sunday -- Acts 2:46 records breaking bread "daily." The meeting extended past midnight, indicating an evening gathering (by Jewish reckoning, the first day began Saturday evening).

**1 Corinthians 16:1-2:** "Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come."

The phrase "by him in store" (par' heauto titheto) means "at his own place" or "at home" -- this is a personal, private action of setting aside money, not a public worship collection. Paul's instruction is logistical: prepare funds in advance so no public gathering for collection is needed when he arrives.

**Revelation 1:10:** "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet."

The text states "the Lord's day" (te kuriake hemera) but does not identify which day this is. The phrase kuriake hemera appears only here in the NT. The text does not say "the first day of the week" (he mia ton sabbaton, the standard phrase for Sunday in the NT -- see Mat 28:1, Mrk 16:2, Luk 24:1, Jhn 20:1, Acts 20:7, 1 Cor 16:2). Jesus called Himself "Lord of the Sabbath" (Mrk 2:28), which is the only explicit connection in Scripture between a specific day and the Lord's ownership.

### Analysis

None of the three first-day passages contains:
- A command to observe the first day of the week
- A designation of Sunday as sacred or holy
- A transfer of Sabbath sacredness from the seventh day to the first day
- Any vocabulary of worship obligation applied to the first day

The text of Acts 20:7 is a narrative event, not a prescriptive command. 1 Corinthians 16:2 is a logistical instruction for private action. Revelation 1:10 does not identify which day "the Lord's day" is.

---

## Category 13: The Cumulative Argument Chain (from studies 1-26)

The following chain draws from evidence classified in prior studies:

1. **The moral law (Decalogue) is permanent, universal, and reflects God's character** (law-01: seven unique markers; spoken by God, written by God, inside the Ark).
2. **The ceremonial system was temporary, pointed to Christ, and was a shadow (skia)** (law-04: five categories of ceremonial law; all share shadow/typological characteristics).
3. **The cross abolished ceremonial law, not the moral law** (law-08: none of seven "abolition" passages names the Decalogue).
4. **The new covenant writes the SAME law on hearts** (law-09: Jer 31:33 / Heb 8:10 -- "MY law"; fault was with the people, not the law).
5. **Faith establishes the moral law** (law-10: Rom 3:31; Spirit-caused obedience).
6. **The Bible itself distinguishes between categories of law** (law-01, law-03, law-24: different origin, medium, repository, vocabulary, NT treatment).
7. **The Sabbath is moral law by every biblical criterion** (law-25: creation origin, Decalogue membership, universal scope, perpetuity language, NT continuation, eschatological presence).
8. **The supposed abolition passages do not name the weekly Sabbath** (law-26: Col 2:16 = ceremonial triad; Rom 14:5 = no sabbaton; Gal 4:10 = no sabbaton; context = circumcision).
9. **Apostolic practice demonstrates ongoing Sabbath observance with Gentile audiences** (law-13, law-15, this study: Acts 13-18 cumulative data).
10. **The Sabbath spans the entire biblical timeline** (Gen 2:2-3 at creation; Exo 20:8-11 in the Decalogue; Isa 66:23 in the new earth; Heb 4:9 in the post-cross era).

---

## Category 14: The Sabbath as Memorial vs. Shadow

### What the Text Says

The Fourth Commandment opens with zakar (H2142, "remember") in the Infinitive Absolute -- the most emphatic Hebrew verb form. zakar is a memorial verb that always points BACKWARD to a completed past event (Exo 13:3; Deu 5:15; 8:2).

The ceremonial system is designated as skia (G4639, "shadow") -- pointing FORWARD to a future reality (Col 2:17; Heb 8:5; Heb 10:1).

*(Examined in depth in sabbath-shadow-or-memorial study.)*

### Analysis

A memorial (zakar) commemorates what has already happened (creation). A shadow (skia) anticipates what will happen (Christ's sacrifice). These are opposite temporal directions. The text uses zakar for the Sabbath and skia for the ceremonial system. The Sabbath fails all five shadow criteria: (1) not instituted after sin, (2) not pointing to a future event, (3) not fulfilled at the cross, (4) not ceremonial in character, (5) not temporary by design.

---

## Category 15: The Accountability Principle

### What the Text Says

Acts 17:30 states: "And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent."

James 4:17 states: "Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin."

John 9:41 states: "If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth."

Luke 12:47-48 states that the servant who knew his master's will and did not act accordingly receives a greater penalty.

### Analysis

These texts state that accountability corresponds to knowledge. The Continues position infers that as understanding of the Sabbath commandment increases, accountability increases. The Abolished position would apply the accountability principle differently, since in that framework no obligation to the seventh-day Sabbath exists.
