## Question
Is the seventh-day Sabbath still binding on believers today? This capstone study compiles and evaluates all biblical evidence bearing on whether the Fourth Commandment — the weekly seventh-day Sabbath — continues in force after the cross, drawing on the findings of studies 13, 24, 25, and 26.

## Summary Answer
The biblical evidence establishes that the seventh-day Sabbath remains binding. No verse in the New Testament explicitly abolishes the weekly Sabbath or transfers its sanctity to another day; instead, the Sabbath is grounded in creation (Gen 2:2-3), confirmed by Jesus as Lord of the Sabbath (Mrk 2:28), treated as operative after the crucifixion by Luke (Luk 23:56), anticipated by Jesus for the post-cross era (Mat 24:20), declared presently remaining by Hebrews using the practice-word sabbatismos (Heb 4:9), and prophesied to continue into the new earth (Isa 66:22-23). The passages most often cited for abolition — Colossians 2:16, Romans 14:5, and Galatians 4:10 — do not contain the word sabbaton applied to the weekly Sabbath and do not supply an explicit abrogation statement; all three I-B resolutions in this study resolve strongly in the Continues direction.

## Key Verses

**Genesis 2:2-3** -- "And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."

**Exodus 20:8-11** -- "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."

**Matthew 24:20** -- "But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day." (Jesus speaks of an event 40 years after the cross, AD 70, treating the Sabbath as still significant.)

**Luke 23:56** -- "And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment." (Written by Luke after the crucifixion with no qualification that the commandment had changed.)

**Hebrews 4:9** -- "There remaineth therefore a rest [sabbatismos] to the people of God." (sabbatismos, [G4520](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4520/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, -ismos suffix = practice/observance; apoleipetai = Present Passive Indicative, "is currently remaining.")

**Isaiah 66:22-23** -- "For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD."

**Isaiah 56:6-7** -- "Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer."

**Revelation 14:12** -- "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."

| E2 | "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work." The rationale given is: "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth...and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it." | Exo 20:8-11 | Continues |
| E3 | "The sabbath was made for man [anthropos, G444 -- humanity generically], and not man for the sabbath." | Mrk 2:27 | Neutral |
| E4 | "Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath." | Mrk 2:28 | Neutral |
| E5 | Jesus went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day "as his custom was" (kata to eiothos, [G1486](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1486/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, Perfect Active Participle -- settled ongoing habit). | Luk 4:16 | Neutral |
| E6 | The women who followed Jesus "rested the sabbath day according to the commandment" (kata ten entolen, [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; the definite article specifies a particular known commandment). Luke writes this after the crucifixion without qualification that the commandment had changed. | Luk 23:56 | Continues |
| E7 | Jesus instructs His followers: "But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day." The context is the destruction of Jerusalem (AD 70), approximately 40 years after the crucifixion. proseuchesthe = Present Imperative (continuous command). | Mat 24:20 | Continues |
| E8 | Paul went to the synagogue at Antioch of Pisidia on the Sabbath day (Acts 13:14). The Gentiles requested preaching "the next sabbath" (v.42). "The next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God" (v.44). | Acts 13:14, 42, 44 | Neutral |
| E9 | "For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day." | Acts 15:21 | Neutral |
| E10 | "On the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made." Philippi had no synagogue; Paul sought Sabbath worship at the riverside. | Acts 16:13 | Neutral |
| E11 | "Paul, as his manner was [kata to eiothos, G1486, Perfect Active Participle], went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures." Same author (Luke), same grammatical construction as Luk 4:16 (Jesus's custom). | Acts 17:2 | Neutral |
| E12 | "He reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath [kata pan sabbaton], and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks." dielegeto = Imperfect (ongoing habitual action); epeithen = Imperfect (ongoing persuading). Both Jews AND Greeks were the audience. Paul continued in Corinth 18 months (Acts 18:11). | Acts 18:4, 11 | Neutral |
| E13 | "There remaineth therefore a rest [sabbatismos, G4520] to the people of God." The author switches from katapausis (G2663, used 8 times in Heb 3-4) to sabbatismos (hapax legomenon; -ismos suffix = practice/observance). apoleipetai (G620) = Present Passive Indicative ("is currently remaining"). | Heb 4:9 | Continues |
| E14 | The author of Hebrews quotes Gen 2:2: "God did rest the seventh day from all his works" (Heb 4:4). The sabbatismos of v.9 is grounded in the creation Sabbath. | Heb 4:4, 9 | Continues |
| E15 | "From one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD." The context is "the new heavens and the new earth" (v.22). Hebrew idiom: middey shabbat beshabbatto = "every week." kol-basar = "all flesh" (universal). | Isa 66:22-23 | Continues |
| E16 | "Blessed is the man...that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil." Sabbath-keeping is paired with general moral conduct. | Isa 56:2 | Continues |
| E17 | "Also the sons of the stranger [beney hannekar -- foreigners], that join themselves to the LORD...every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; even them will I bring to my holy mountain." God promises to "gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him" (v.8). | Isa 56:6-7, 8 | Continues |
| E18 | "If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable." God calls the Sabbath "my holy day." | Isa 58:13 | Continues |
| E19 | "Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant [berit olam]." | Exo 31:16 | Continues |
| E20 | "It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever [le-olam]: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed." The creation rationale grounds the sign. | Exo 31:17 | Continues |
| E21 | "Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign [oth] between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify [meqaddisham, Piel Participle -- ongoing sanctifying action] them." | Eze 20:12 | Neutral |
| E22 | "Hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God." | Eze 20:20 | Neutral |
| E23 | "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments [entolas] of God, and the faith of Jesus." | Rev 14:12 | Continues |
| E24 | "The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments [entolas] of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ." | Rev 12:17 | Continues |
| E25 | "Blessed are they that do his commandments [entolas], that they may have right to the tree of life." | Rev 22:14 | Continues |
| E26 | "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow [skia] of things to come." The triad (holyday/new moon/sabbath days) matches the OT ceremonial triad (1 Chr 23:31; 2 Chr 2:4; 2 Chr 31:3). | Col 2:16-17 | Neutral |
| E27 | Col 2:14 states the thing "nailed to the cross" was the cheirographon tois dogmasin ("handwriting of ordinances"). cheirographon = hand-written document. The Decalogue was written by God's finger (Exo 31:18), not by a human hand. dogma in NT usage = ceremonial regulations (Eph 2:15), never the Decalogue. | Col 2:14 | Neutral |
| E28 | Romans 14:5 states: "One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike." The word sabbaton does not appear in Romans 14. The context (14:1) is "doubtful disputations." | Rom 14:5 | Neutral |
| E29 | Galatians 4:10 states: "Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years." The word sabbaton does not appear in Galatians. The context is the circumcision controversy (Gal 2:3-5; 5:2-6; 6:12-15). | Gal 4:10 | Neutral |
| E30 | Acts 20:7 states: "Upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow." This is a single event narrative. No command to observe the first day. Breaking bread was done "daily" (Acts 2:46). | Acts 20:7 | Neutral |
| E31 | 1 Cor 16:2 states: "Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store." par' heauto titheto = "at his own place" / "at home." This is private financial preparation, not a public worship collection. | 1 Cor 16:2 | Neutral |
| E32 | Rev 1:10 states: "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day." The phrase te kuriake hemera does not identify which day. The text does not say "the first day of the week." Jesus identified Himself as "Lord of the Sabbath" (Mrk 2:28). | Rev 1:10 | Neutral |
| E33 | "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." Paul identifies the specific commandment as "thou shalt not covet" (Rom 7:7) -- the Tenth Commandment -- placing the Decalogue as the referent. | Rom 7:12, 7 | Continues |
| E34 | "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." | Rom 3:31 | Continues |
| E35 | "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." | Mat 5:17-18 | Continues |
| E36 | "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God." Paul explicitly separates circumcision (ceremonial) from "the commandments of God" (moral). | 1 Cor 7:19 | Continues |
| E37 | The Fourth Commandment opens with zakar (H2142, "remember") in the Infinitive Absolute -- the most emphatic Hebrew verb form. zakar is a memorial verb pointing backward to a completed past event. | Exo 20:8 | Neutral |
| E38 | skia ("shadow") in all three NT theological uses (Col 2:17; Heb 8:5; Heb 10:1) designates the ceremonial/typological system. No NT passage applies skia to the Decalogue or the weekly Sabbath specifically. | Col 2:17; Heb 8:5; 10:1 | Neutral |
| E39 | The annual feasts are described as "beside the sabbaths of the LORD" (millibad, Lev 23:38). millibad (H4480+H905) means "apart from/besides" -- explicitly separating the weekly Sabbath from the feast system. | Lev 23:37-38 | Continues |
| E40 | "The times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent." | Acts 17:30 | Neutral |
| E41 | "To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin." | Jas 4:17 | Neutral |
| E42 | "If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth." | Jhn 9:41 | Neutral |
| E43 | "Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you." | Exo 31:13 | Neutral |

## 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The text of Luke-Acts uses the identical construction kata to eiothos (G1486, Perfect Active Participle) for both Jesus's Sabbath custom (Luk 4:16) and Paul's Sabbath custom (Acts 17:2). Same author, same grammatical form. | E5, E11 | Observable same-author, same-vocabulary fact. Both sides can verify the Greek text. |
| N2 | The Sabbath is the only day in Scripture identified as belonging to the Lord by Jesus Himself: "The Son of man is Lord of the sabbath" (Mrk 2:28). No other day receives this designation. | E4, E32 | E4 records Jesus's claim; E32 records that "the Lord's day" is unidentified. The only explicit day-Lord connection in the NT is E4. |
| N3 | The author of Hebrews deliberately chose a different word (sabbatismos, G4520) from the word used eight times previously (katapausis, G2663) in the same passage. This is an observable word switch. | E13, E14 | Grammatical fact verifiable in the Greek text. Both sides acknowledge the different words. |
| N4 | None of the three passages cited as evidence for Sabbath abolition (Col 2:16; Rom 14:5; Gal 4:10) contains a direct statement that the weekly seventh-day Sabbath is abolished, ended, or no longer binding. | E26, E27, E28, E29 | Observable textual fact. The word "abolished" (or equivalent) + "weekly Sabbath" does not appear in any of these verses. |
| N5 | None of the three first-day passages (Acts 20:7; 1 Cor 16:2; Rev 1:10) contains a command to observe the first day of the week as a day of worship, a transfer of Sabbath obligations to Sunday, or a designation of Sunday as sacred. | E30, E31, E32 | Observable textual fact. No such command or designation exists in these verses. |
| N6 | The Sabbath appears in three distinct time frames in the biblical text: creation (Gen 2:2-3), the present era (Heb 4:9 -- sabbatismos "is currently remaining"), and the new earth (Isa 66:22-23). | E1, E13, E15 | Three verifiable textual references spanning the entire biblical timeline. |
| N7 | Luke identifies the Sabbath rest of the women after the crucifixion as being "according to the commandment" (kata ten entolen, E6). Luke also records Paul's Sabbath practice using eiothos (E11) and documents ongoing Sabbath observance throughout Acts (E8-E12). The same author treats the Sabbath commandment as operative after the cross. | E6, E8-E12 | Observable same-author pattern. Luke never qualifies, corrects, or notes a change in the Sabbath's status across his two-volume work. |
| N8 | The triad "holyday / new moon / sabbath days" in Col 2:16 matches the OT ceremonial triad pattern found in 1 Chr 23:31; 2 Chr 2:4; 2 Chr 31:3; Neh 10:33; Eze 45:17; Hos 2:11. | E26 | Verifiable textual comparison of vocabulary patterns across OT and NT. Both sides can observe the pattern match. |
| N9 | Paul separates circumcision from "the commandments of God" in 1 Cor 7:19. This demonstrates that at least one Pauline text distinguishes between ceremonial requirements (circumcision) and moral commandments. | E36 | Direct textual observation. Paul treats these as different categories in the same sentence. |
| N10 | The Fourth Commandment uses the memorial verb zakar (E37); the ceremonial system is designated skia/shadow (E38). These point in opposite temporal directions -- zakar backward to a past event, skia forward to a future reality. | E37, E38 | Observable linguistic fact. Memorial verbs point backward; shadow language points forward. |

## 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that the seventh-day Sabbath is still binding on all believers today as moral law. | I-A | E2 (Fourth Commandment, creation rationale), E6 (kata ten entolen after crucifixion), E7 (Mat 24:20 -- Sabbath concern for AD 70), E13 (sabbatismos "currently remaining"), E15 (Sabbath in new earth), E16-17 (universal scope), E19-20 (perpetual covenant), E23-25 (end-time commandment-keeping), E33-36 (law continuation), N4 (no passage abolishes the weekly Sabbath), N5 (no passage transfers Sabbath to Sunday), N6 (creation-to-new-earth span). | No single verse states "the seventh-day Sabbath is binding on all people in all ages." This claim systematizes multiple E/N items into a comprehensive position. All components come from the E/N tables -- only systematization (#5) is added. | #5 (systematizing) |
| I2 | The Bible teaches that Paul observed the Sabbath out of personal conviction, not merely as an evangelism strategy. | I-A | E10 (Philippi -- no synagogue, Paul sought Sabbath worship at riverside), E11 (eiothos = settled habit, same word as Jesus's custom), E12 (Jews AND Greeks persuaded), N1 (same author uses same construction for Jesus and Paul), N7 (Luke treats Sabbath as operative throughout Luke-Acts). | No verse states "Paul kept the Sabbath because he believed it was binding." This systematizes the pattern of Paul's behavior across multiple cities, including where no synagogue existed. All components are text-derived. | #5 (systematizing) |
| I3 | The Bible teaches that the weekly Sabbath was abolished at the cross along with the ceremonial system. | I-B | FOR abolition: E26 (Col 2:16 mentions "sabbath days" in a shadow context). AGAINST abolition: E6 (Luk 23:56 -- "according to the commandment" post-crucifixion), E7 (Mat 24:20 -- Sabbath concern for AD 70), E13 (sabbatismos remains, Heb 4:9), E15 (Sabbath in new earth), E19-20 (perpetual covenant), E39 (millibad separates weekly from ceremonial), N4 (no passage explicitly abolishes the weekly Sabbath), N8 (Col 2:16 triad matches ceremonial pattern). | Requires: (a) identifying "sabbath days" in Col 2:16 as the weekly Sabbath despite the ceremonial triad pattern (N8); (b) overriding the post-crucifixion evidence (E6, E7, E13); (c) reading "perpetual covenant" as temporary. Both sides have textual material to cite. | #1 (adding a concept: "sabbath days" = weekly Sabbath), #2 (choosing between readings of Col 2:16), #5 (systematizing) |
| I4 | The Bible teaches that the Sabbath was only for ethnic Israel, not for Gentile believers. | I-D | E17 states that "the sons of the stranger" (foreigners) who keep the Sabbath receive access to God's holy mountain (Isa 56:6-7). E3 states the Sabbath "was made for man" (anthropos = humanity). E15 states "all flesh" shall worship on the Sabbath in the new earth. E12 records Jews AND Greeks hearing Paul on the Sabbath. E19 says "children of Israel" shall keep the Sabbath. | Requires overriding E17 (foreigners included), E3 (anthropos = humanity), E15 (all flesh), and E12 (Greeks included) by elevating "children of Israel" in E19 above these universal statements. The claim that the Sabbath is Israel-only must set aside multiple explicit texts that extend the Sabbath beyond Israel. | #1 (adding the concept that "children of Israel" excludes all others despite contrary texts), #3 (applying an ethnic exclusion framework the text does not state) |
| I5 | The Bible teaches that Christians should observe Sunday (the first day of the week) instead of the seventh-day Sabbath. | I-D | E30 (Acts 20:7 -- a single event, no command), E31 (1 Cor 16:2 -- private financial preparation, not worship), E32 (Rev 1:10 -- does not identify which day). N5 (no first-day passage contains a command for Sunday observance or Sabbath transfer). | No verse commands Sunday observance or transfers Sabbath sanctity to the first day. This claim requires adding a concept the text does not contain. It also requires overriding N5 and the absence of any transfer command. | #1 (adding a concept: day transfer), #3 (applying church tradition as an external framework) |
| I6 | The Bible teaches that sabbatismos in Hebrews 4:9 refers only to a spiritual rest in Christ, not to seventh-day observance. | I-B | FOR spiritual-only reading: The broader context of Heb 3-4 discusses entering God's rest (katapausis) through faith. AGAINST spiritual-only reading: E13 (sabbatismos is a different word from katapausis; -ismos suffix = practice), E14 (Heb 4:4 quotes Gen 2:2, grounding the argument in the creation seventh day), N3 (deliberate word switch from katapausis to sabbatismos). | Requires the deliberate word switch (N3) to be insignificant and the -ismos suffix to mean something other than its standard morphological meaning (practice/observance). The spiritual dimension of rest is not in dispute -- the question is whether the text limits sabbatismos to only a spiritual meaning when the word itself denotes practice and the passage grounds it in the creation Sabbath. | #2 (choosing between readings: spiritual-only vs. including literal observance) |
| I7 | The Bible teaches that Isaiah's prophecies about the Sabbath (Isa 56, 58, 66) use Sabbath language figuratively for generic worship, not literal seventh-day observance. | I-D | E15 (Isa 66:23 uses the specific Hebrew idiom "from sabbath to its sabbath" = every week, with "all flesh" worshipping). E16-17 (Isa 56 pairs Sabbath-keeping with moral conduct and extends it to foreigners). E18 (Isa 58:13 calls the Sabbath "my holy day"). | Requires overriding the specific temporal language (weekly distributive idiom), the specific moral pairing, and the divine possessive ("my holy day") by introducing a figurative reading the text does not signal. No indicator of figurative intent appears in these passages. | #1 (adding a figurative reading the text does not signal), #3 (applying a spiritualizing hermeneutic external to the text) |
| I8 | The Bible teaches that Colossians 2:16 "sabbath days" refers to the weekly seventh-day Sabbath. | I-B | FOR this reading: E26 mentions "sabbath days" (sabbaton). AGAINST: N8 (the triad matches the OT ceremonial triad pattern); E27 (the context is cheirographon/dogmasin = ceremonial regulations); E38 (skia in NT = ceremonial, never Decalogue); E39 (millibad separates weekly Sabbath from ceremonies). | Both sides have textual material. Identifying "sabbath days" in Col 2:16 as the weekly Sabbath requires: (a) choosing against the ceremonial triad pattern (N8); (b) overriding the cheirographon/dogmasin context (E27); (c) reading skia as applying to the Decalogue despite E38. | #2 (choosing between readings of sabbaton), #5 (systematizing) |
| I9 | The Bible teaches that Romans 14:5 makes Sabbath observance optional. | I-D | E28 (sabbaton does not appear in Rom 14). N4 (no passage explicitly abolishes the weekly Sabbath). The context (Rom 14:1) is "doubtful disputations" -- matters of personal conscience. | Requires adding the weekly Sabbath to a passage that does not name it. The text discusses "days" without identifying them. To make this a Sabbath-abolition text requires importing the concept that "days" includes the Sabbath, which the text does not state. | #1 (adding a concept: "days" = Sabbath), #2 (choosing to read unidentified "days" as including the Sabbath) |
| I10 | The Bible teaches that Galatians 4:10 includes the Sabbath among the "days" being condemned. | I-D | E29 (sabbaton does not appear in Galatians; context = circumcision controversy). | Requires adding the weekly Sabbath to a passage that does not name it and whose context is circumcision. | #1 (adding a concept), #2 (choosing a reading) |

## I-B Resolution Subsections

### I-B Resolution: I3 -- The weekly Sabbath was abolished at the cross

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR: E26 (Col 2:16 mentions "sabbath days" in a shadow context)
- AGAINST: E6 (Luk 23:56 -- "according to the commandment" post-crucifixion), E7 (Mat 24:20 -- Sabbath concern for AD 70), E13 (sabbatismos remains), E14 (grounded in creation), E15 (Sabbath in new earth), E19 (perpetual covenant), E20 (sign forever), E39 (millibad separation), N4 (no passage explicitly abolishes the weekly Sabbath), N8 (Col 2:16 triad matches ceremonial pattern)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E26 | Ambiguous | "sabbath days" could refer to weekly or ceremonial sabbaths; the triad pattern (N8) and skia context (E38) suggest ceremonial |
| E6 | Plain | Directly states the women rested "according to the commandment" on the Sabbath after the crucifixion |
| E7 | Plain | Jesus directly instructs prayer about the Sabbath for an event 40 years after the cross |
| E13 | Plain | Directly states a sabbatismos remains; the word denotes Sabbath-keeping practice |
| E15 | Plain | Directly states Sabbath worship in the new earth |
| E19 | Plain | Directly states "perpetual covenant" |
| E39 | Plain | Directly states the weekly Sabbath is "beside" (apart from) the feast system |
| N4 | Plain | Observable absence -- no verse states "the weekly Sabbath is abolished" |
| N8 | Contextually Clear | The triad pattern is verifiable across multiple OT texts |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR abolition: 1 Ambiguous item (E26).
AGAINST abolition: 6 Plain items (E6, E7, E13, E15, E19, E39), 1 Contextually Clear item (N8), 1 Plain observation (N4).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The plain statements (E6, E7, E13, E15, E19, E39) determine the reading of the ambiguous item (E26). Since the triad in Col 2:16 matches the OT ceremonial pattern (N8), the cheirographon/dogmasin context is ceremonial (E27), and skia applies to the ceremonial system not the Decalogue (E38), the plain evidence governs: "sabbath days" in Col 2:16 refers to ceremonial sabbaths, not the weekly seventh-day Sabbath.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
Plain statements on the AGAINST side with only an Ambiguous statement on the FOR side. The weight of evidence does not support the claim that the weekly Sabbath was abolished at the cross.

---

### I-B Resolution: I6 -- sabbatismos refers only to spiritual rest, not seventh-day observance

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR spiritual-only: The broader Heb 3-4 context discusses entering rest through faith (katapausis framework)
- AGAINST spiritual-only: E13 (sabbatismos = practice word, -ismos suffix), E14 (grounded in Gen 2:2 -- the seventh day), N3 (deliberate word switch)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Heb 3-4 katapausis context | Contextually Clear | The faith/rest theme is present but does not exclude literal Sabbath observance |
| E13 | Plain | The word sabbatismos and its morphology are unambiguous; apoleipetai is present tense |
| E14 | Plain | The creation Sabbath is explicitly cited as the basis |
| N3 | Plain | The word switch is an observable grammatical fact |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR spiritual-only: 1 Contextually Clear item (broader context).
AGAINST spiritual-only: 2 Plain items (E13, E14), 1 Plain observation (N3).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The plain meaning of sabbatismos (-ismos = practice) and its grounding in the creation Sabbath (E14) govern the contextually clear broader theme. The spiritual rest dimension is not denied, but the text uses a practice word, not a state-of-being word, and grounds it in the specific seventh day.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
Plain items on one side, Contextually Clear on the other. The text uses a Sabbath-practice word grounded in the creation seventh day.

---

### I-B Resolution: I8 -- Col 2:16 "sabbath days" = weekly Sabbath

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR weekly Sabbath reading: E26 (sabbaton appears, which is the standard word for Sabbath)
- AGAINST weekly Sabbath reading: N8 (triad = OT ceremonial pattern), E27 (cheirographon/dogmasin = ceremonial), E38 (skia = ceremonial system), E39 (millibad separation)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E26 (sabbaton) | Ambiguous | sabbaton can refer to either weekly or annual sabbaths |
| N8 | Contextually Clear | The triad pattern is verifiable and consistent |
| E27 | Plain | cheirographon = hand-written; dogmasin = ceremonial regulations |
| E38 | Contextually Clear | skia pattern is consistent across 3 NT uses |
| E39 | Plain | millibad separation is explicit in Lev 23:38 |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR weekly Sabbath reading: 1 Ambiguous item.
AGAINST weekly Sabbath reading: 2 Plain items (E27, E39), 2 Contextually Clear items (N8, E38).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The plain and contextually clear items determine the reading of the ambiguous sabbaton. The ceremonial context (cheirographon/dogmasin), the triad pattern (matching OT ceremonial lists), and the skia designation (never applied to the Decalogue) indicate that "sabbath days" in Col 2:16 refers to the ceremonial sabbaths, not the weekly seventh-day Sabbath.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
Plain and Contextually Clear items on one side; only an Ambiguous item on the other.

## 4. Verification Phase

### Step A: Verify explicit statements
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases actual verse text. Verified.
- Each represents the plain meaning of the words. Verified.
- Positional items state what the text says, not what a position infers. Verified.

### Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items
- All Continues-classified E-items passed Tree 3 verification above.
- All Neutral-classified items are textual observations both sides accept.
- No Abolished-classified E-items exist in this study (no verse directly states the weekly Sabbath is abolished).

### Step B: Verify necessary implications
- N1: Same-author, same-vocabulary observation. Verifiable. Both sides agree.
- N2: Only explicit Lord-day connection in NT is Mrk 2:28. Both sides can verify.
- N3: Word switch is grammatical fact. Both sides agree.
- N4: Observable absence. Both sides can verify sabbaton + "abolished" does not appear.
- N5: Observable absence. Both sides can verify no Sunday command exists.
- N6: Three verifiable time-frame references. Both sides agree.
- N7: Same-author pattern across Luke-Acts. Both sides can observe.
- N8: Triad pattern match verifiable. Both sides can compare texts.
- N9: Direct textual observation from 1 Cor 7:19. Both sides agree.
- N10: Linguistic fact about zakar vs. skia temporal directions. Both sides agree.

All N-items pass the three N-tier tests (universal agreement, no interpretation required, zero added concepts).

### Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test)
- I1: All components from E/N tables. Text-derived. Correct as I-A.
- I2: All components from E/N tables. Text-derived. Correct as I-A.

- I4: Requires overriding E17, E3, E15. External concept. Correct as I-D.
- I5: Requires adding a concept not in text. External. Correct as I-D.
- I6: E/N items on both sides. Text-derived. Correct as I-B.
- I7: Requires overriding E15, E16-17, E18. External concept. Correct as I-D.
- I8: E/N items on both sides. Text-derived. Correct as I-B.
- I9: Requires adding a concept to the text. External. Correct as I-D.
- I10: Requires adding a concept to the text. External. Correct as I-D.

### Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test)
- I1: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. Aligns. Correct as I-A.
- I2: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value. Aligns. Correct as I-A.
- I3: Requires E26 to mean weekly Sabbath (against N8 pattern). Conflicts. Correct as I-B.
- I4: Requires overriding E17, E3, E15 universality. Conflicts. Correct as I-D.
- I5: Requires overriding N5 (no command exists). Conflicts. Correct as I-D.
- I6: Requires sabbatismos to NOT mean practice. Conflicts with E13. Correct as I-B.
- I7: Requires overriding literal Sabbath language. Conflicts. Correct as I-D.
- I8: Requires E26 to override N8, E27, E38, E39. Conflicts. Correct as I-B.
- I9: Requires adding Sabbath to a passage without sabbaton. Conflicts. Correct as I-D.
- I10: Requires adding Sabbath to a passage without sabbaton. Conflicts. Correct as I-D.

### Step E: Run consistency checks
- I1 (I-A): Requires only #5 (systematizing). Correct.
- I2 (I-A): Requires only #5 (systematizing). Correct.
- I3 (I-B): E/N items on both sides (E26 FOR; E6, E7, E13, E15, E19, E39, N4, N8 AGAINST). Correct.
- I6 (I-B): E/N items on both sides (context FOR; E13, E14, N3 AGAINST). Correct.
- I8 (I-B): E/N items on both sides (E26 FOR; N8, E27, E38, E39 AGAINST). Correct.
- I4 (I-D): Overrides E17, E3, E15. Correct.
- I5 (I-D): Overrides N5. Correct.
- I7 (I-D): Overrides E15, E16-17, E18. Correct.
- I9 (I-D): Overrides N4 (no passage abolishes weekly Sabbath) by importing Sabbath into a text without sabbaton. Correct.
- I10 (I-D): Same as I9. Correct.

### Step F: Verify SIS connections
- All I-B resolutions documented with 5-step protocol.
- N8 (triad pattern) = #4a (verified textual connection: shared vocabulary across OT and NT).
- N1 (eiothos connection) = #4a (same author, same word, same form).

## 7. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

### What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):

1. God rested on, blessed, and sanctified the seventh day at creation (Gen 2:2-3).
2. The Fourth Commandment commands Sabbath observance and cites creation as its rationale (Exo 20:8-11).
3. The Sabbath was "made for man" (anthropos -- humanity), not for a specific ethnic group (Mrk 2:27).
4. Jesus is "Lord of the Sabbath" (Mrk 2:28).
5. Jesus habitually observed the Sabbath (Luk 4:16, eiothos -- settled custom).
6. The women rested on the Sabbath "according to the commandment" after the crucifixion (Luk 23:56).
7. Jesus instructed prayer about the Sabbath for an event 40 years after the cross (Mat 24:20).
8. Paul's manner (eiothos -- same word as Jesus's custom) was to attend Sabbath worship (Acts 17:2).
9. Paul observed the Sabbath "every sabbath" for 18 months in Corinth, persuading "Jews and Greeks" (Acts 18:4, 11).
10. Paul sought Sabbath worship in Philippi where no synagogue existed (Acts 16:13).
11. A sabbatismos ("Sabbath-keeping") "is currently remaining" for the people of God (Heb 4:9).
12. The sabbatismos argument is grounded in the creation Sabbath (Heb 4:4 quoting Gen 2:2).
13. Isaiah prophesies Sabbath worship in the new earth by "all flesh" (Isa 66:22-23).
14. Isaiah extends Sabbath blessings to foreigners (Isa 56:6-7).
15. The Sabbath is designated as "perpetual covenant" (berit olam) and "sign forever" (Exo 31:16-17).
16. No passage in the NT explicitly states that the weekly seventh-day Sabbath is abolished.
17. No passage in the NT contains a command to observe the first day of the week or transfer Sabbath obligations to Sunday.
18. The ceremonial triad in Col 2:16 matches the OT ceremonial pattern.
19. End-time saints are characterized by keeping "the commandments of God" (Rev 14:12; 12:17; 22:14).
20. Paul separates circumcision from "the commandments of God" (1 Cor 7:19).
21. The Sabbath uses memorial language (zakar); the ceremonial system uses shadow language (skia).
22. Leviticus 23:38 explicitly separates the weekly Sabbath from the annual feasts using millibad.

### What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):

1. CANNOT say: "A specific verse states the weekly Sabbath is abolished." (No such verse exists -- N4.)
2. CANNOT say: "A specific verse commands Sunday observance." (No such verse exists -- N5.)
3. CANNOT say: "A specific verse transfers Sabbath sanctity from Saturday to Sunday." (No such verse exists.)
4. CANNOT say: "Romans 14:5 abolishes the Sabbath." (sabbaton does not appear in Romans 14 -- E28.)
5. CANNOT say: "Galatians 4:10 abolishes the Sabbath." (sabbaton does not appear in Galatians -- E29.)
6. CANNOT say: "Colossians 2:16 definitively refers to the weekly Sabbath." (The triad matches the ceremonial pattern -- N8; the reading requires choosing between two referents -- I-B classified.)
7. CANNOT say: "The Sabbath was only for Israel." (The text extends it to foreigners [E17], humanity [E3], and all flesh [E15].)
8. CANNOT say: "Acts 20:7 establishes Sunday worship." (Single event narrative, no command -- E30.)
9. CANNOT say: "sabbatismos in Hebrews 4:9 definitely has no connection to literal Sabbath observance." (The word means Sabbath-keeping practice; the argument is grounded in the creation Sabbath -- E13, E14, N3.)
10. CANNOT say: "All scholars agree on the exact scope of the Sabbath command in every era." (The application is an inference [I-A] from explicit data, not itself an explicit statement.)
