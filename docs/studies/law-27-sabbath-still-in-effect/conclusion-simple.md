# Is the Seventh-Day Sabbath Still Binding Today?

**A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence**

---

Few questions in Christian theology spark more debate than this one: Does the seventh-day Sabbath -- the Saturday rest established at creation and commanded in the Ten Commandments -- still apply to believers after the cross? Many Christians today worship on Sunday and consider the Sabbath a relic of the Old Testament. Others insist that Scripture never revokes the Fourth Commandment. This study examined every relevant passage in the Bible, both those that support the continuation of the Sabbath and those commonly cited against it, and arrived at its findings based on what the text actually says.

## The Sabbath Begins at Creation, Not at Sinai

One of the most important facts in this discussion is where the Sabbath comes from. Many people assume the Sabbath was introduced in the law of Moses, making it part of the ceremonial system given exclusively to Israel. But the Bible places the Sabbath at the very beginning of human history, before any nation existed:

> "And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made." (Genesis 2:2-3)

God rested on the seventh day, blessed it, and sanctified it -- set it apart as holy -- at creation. This was long before Moses, long before Israel, and long before any ceremonial law. The Fourth Commandment itself points back to this origin:

> "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it." (Exodus 20:8-11)

The command opens with the word "remember," which looks backward to something already established. The reason given is not the exodus from Egypt or any event in Israel's history -- it is creation itself. This grounds the Sabbath in God's relationship to all humanity, not to one nation.

Jesus confirmed this universal scope when He said:

> "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath." (Mark 2:27)

The Greek word translated "man" here is *anthropos*, which means humanity in general. Jesus also declared Himself to be the authority over this day:

> "Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath." (Mark 2:28)

This is the only day in the New Testament that Jesus explicitly claims lordship over.

## The Sabbath After the Cross

If the Sabbath ended at the cross, we would expect the New Testament to say so plainly. Instead, the evidence runs in the opposite direction.

After Jesus was crucified, the women who followed Him prepared burial spices and then paused their work:

> "And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment." (Luke 23:56)

Luke wrote this account after the crucifixion. He identifies their Sabbath rest as being "according to the commandment" -- with no comment, correction, or footnote that the commandment had changed. Luke, writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, treats the Sabbath commandment as still in effect.

Jesus Himself anticipated the Sabbath continuing well beyond the cross. Speaking of the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 -- roughly forty years after His death -- He told His followers:

> "But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day." (Matthew 24:20)

If the Sabbath was going to be abolished at the cross, why would Jesus instruct His followers to pray about Sabbath-day travel for an event decades later? The instruction only makes sense if the Sabbath would still be meaningful to them.

## The Practice of the Apostles

Throughout the book of Acts, the apostles consistently observed the Sabbath. Luke, the same author who recorded the women resting "according to the commandment," uses the same Greek word (*eiothos* -- a settled, ongoing habit) to describe both Jesus's Sabbath custom and Paul's:

> "And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures." (Acts 17:2)

> "And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks." (Acts 18:4)

Paul did not attend the synagogue on the Sabbath only to reach Jewish audiences. In Corinth, his audience included both Jews and Greeks, and he continued this pattern for eighteen months. In Philippi, where there was no synagogue at all, Paul still sought out Sabbath worship:

> "And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made." (Acts 16:13)

If the Sabbath had been abolished, it is difficult to explain why Paul -- the apostle to the Gentiles -- would consistently seek Sabbath worship in city after city, including places with no Jewish synagogue.

## Hebrews 4:9 -- A Sabbath-Keeping Remains

The book of Hebrews contains a passage that bears directly on this question. Throughout chapters 3 and 4, the author discusses "rest" using the Greek word *katapausis*. But in one verse, the author deliberately switches to a completely different word:

> "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God." (Hebrews 4:9)

The word translated "rest" here is *sabbatismos*, and it appears nowhere else in the entire New Testament. The *-ismos* ending in Greek denotes a practice or observance -- not merely a state of being. The verb "remaineth" is in the present tense, meaning it "is currently remaining." And the very passage grounds this sabbatismos in the creation Sabbath by quoting Genesis 2:2 just a few verses earlier (Hebrews 4:4).

The author of Hebrews had been using *katapausis* for eight consecutive references. The switch to *sabbatismos* -- a practice word tied to the seventh day of creation -- was deliberate. The text declares that a Sabbath-keeping practice remains for God's people.

## The Sabbath in Prophecy

The Sabbath does not only appear in the past and present of Scripture. It also appears in prophecy about the future. Isaiah writes about the new heavens and new earth:

> "For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD." (Isaiah 66:22-23)

The phrase "from one sabbath to another" is a Hebrew idiom meaning "every week." And the worshippers are described as "all flesh" -- not just Israel. If the Sabbath exists at creation and will exist in the new earth, the claim that it was temporarily suspended between the cross and the second coming has no textual support.

Isaiah also records God extending Sabbath blessings to foreigners -- people who are not ethnically Israelite:

> "Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer." (Isaiah 56:6-7)

The Sabbath is described as a "perpetual covenant" and a "sign forever":

> "Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed." (Exodus 31:16-17)

## What About Colossians, Romans, and Galatians?

The three passages most frequently cited to argue that the Sabbath has been abolished are Colossians 2:16, Romans 14:5, and Galatians 4:10. This study examined each one carefully.

**Colossians 2:16-17** mentions "sabbath days" in a list alongside holydays and new moons. But this triad -- holydays, new moons, and sabbaths -- is a well-known Old Testament formula that refers to the ceremonial feast system (see 1 Chronicles 23:31; 2 Chronicles 2:4; 2 Chronicles 31:3). The context of Colossians 2:14 identifies what was nailed to the cross as the "handwriting of ordinances" -- ceremonial regulations. The word "shadow" in verse 17 is used in the New Testament only for the ceremonial system, never for the Ten Commandments. And Leviticus 23:38 explicitly separates the weekly Sabbath from the annual feasts using the Hebrew word *millibad*, meaning "apart from" or "besides." The ceremonial calendar had its own sabbaths -- annual rest days connected to specific feasts -- and these are distinct from the weekly seventh-day Sabbath.

**Romans 14:5** says "one man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike." But the word for Sabbath (*sabbaton*) does not appear anywhere in Romans 14. The context identifies the topic as "doubtful disputations" -- matters of personal conscience -- not the Ten Commandments.

**Galatians 4:10** says "ye observe days, and months, and times, and years." Again, *sabbaton* does not appear anywhere in the entire book of Galatians. The context throughout Galatians is the circumcision controversy, not the Sabbath.

None of these three passages contains a direct statement that the weekly seventh-day Sabbath is abolished, ended, or no longer binding.

## What About Sunday?

Three passages are sometimes cited as evidence for Sunday worship: Acts 20:7, 1 Corinthians 16:2, and Revelation 1:10. None of them contains a command to observe the first day of the week as a day of worship, and none transfers Sabbath obligations to Sunday.

Acts 20:7 describes a single event where Paul preached on the first day of the week -- it is a narrative, not a command. First Corinthians 16:2 instructs believers to set aside money "at home" on the first day -- private financial preparation, not a public worship service. Revelation 1:10 mentions "the Lord's day" without identifying which day it is; the only day Jesus explicitly claimed lordship over was the Sabbath (Mark 2:28).

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

Honest study requires acknowledging what the text does not explicitly state, even when the overall evidence points in a clear direction.

The Bible does not contain a single verse that says, in so many words, "the seventh-day Sabbath is binding on all people in all ages as moral law." The conclusion that the Sabbath is universally binding comes from assembling multiple passages -- creation origin, the Fourth Commandment, Jesus's teaching, apostolic practice, Hebrews 4:9, and Isaiah's prophecies -- into a coherent picture. Every component of that picture comes directly from Scripture, but the comprehensive statement itself is a synthesis, not a single proof-text.

The Bible does not spell out every detail of how Sabbath observance applies in every cultural context. The principle is clear; the specific application in diverse circumstances involves judgment.

Not all scholars agree on the exact scope of the Sabbath command in every era. The study's conclusion is based on the weight of biblical evidence, but the existence of the debate itself should be acknowledged honestly.

## Conclusion

The biblical evidence for the continuation of the seventh-day Sabbath is substantial and spans the entire arc of Scripture -- from creation to the new earth. The Sabbath was established before any nation existed, grounded in creation, commanded in the Decalogue, observed by Jesus as a settled habit, treated as still in force after the crucifixion by Luke, anticipated by Jesus for decades after the cross, declared as presently remaining by the author of Hebrews using a practice word tied to the seventh day, extended to foreigners by Isaiah, and prophesied to continue into eternity for all flesh.

Against this, no verse in the New Testament explicitly abolishes the weekly Sabbath. No verse commands Sunday observance. No verse transfers the Sabbath to another day. The passages most commonly cited against the Sabbath either refer to the ceremonial system or do not mention the Sabbath by name at all.

The end-time people of God are described in Revelation as those who "keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12). The Sabbath is the Fourth Commandment.
