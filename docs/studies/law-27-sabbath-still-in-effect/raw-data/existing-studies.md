## Primary Prerequisite Studies (4)

### law-13: Jesus and the Sabbath
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-13-jesus-and-sabbath/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- 22 Explicit (E) evidence items supporting Jesus's Sabbath observance
- Jesus attended synagogue on the Sabbath "as his custom was" (Luke 4:16, eiothos G1486)
- The same vocabulary (eiothos) describes Paul's Sabbath synagogue attendance (Acts 17:2)
- Jesus declared Himself "Lord of the Sabbath" (Mark 2:28) - Lord over, not abolisher of
- Post-crucifixion evidence: women rested "according to the commandment" (Luke 23:56)
- Matt 24:20 prophecy presupposes Sabbath observance decades after the cross
- Hebrews 4:9 uses unique term sabbatismos (G4520) - distinct from katapausis (G2663)
- Jesus reformed Sabbath observance from Pharisaic additions, not from the Sabbath itself

### law-24: Weekly Sabbath vs. Ceremonial Sabbaths
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-24-weekly-sabbath-vs-ceremonial-sabbaths/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- Leviticus 23 structure separates weekly Sabbath (v.3) from annual sabbaths (vv.4-44) using millibad ("besides/apart from," v.38)
- Weekly Sabbath has distinct vocabulary: shabbath shabbathon used for weekly Sabbath in Lev 23:3
- Annual sabbaths explicitly listed with specific dates; weekly Sabbath has no date, only a recurring cycle
- The distinction is maintained throughout Scripture: weekly = moral/creation-based; annual = ceremonial/typical
- Col 2:16 "sabbath days" (sabbaton) in context refers to the ceremonial triad (feast days, new moons, sabbath days) matching the annual festival pattern

### law-25: Sabbath - Moral or Ceremonial?
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-25-sabbath-moral-or-ceremonial/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- 7 criteria tested: (1) creation origin, (2) Decalogue inclusion, (3) universal scope, (4) moral character, (5) perpetuity language, (6) NT continuation, (7) eschatological presence
- 41 E-items confirm the Sabbath meets all 7 criteria for moral law classification
- Creation origin (Gen 2:2-3): established before sin, before Israel, before Sinai
- Decalogue inclusion: the 4th commandment written by God's finger on stone
- Universal scope: "made for man" (Mark 2:27, anthropos = humanity, not just Israel)
- Moral character: rooted in God's own nature/example (He rested, blessed, sanctified)
- Perpetuity language: "perpetual covenant" (berit olam, Exo 31:16), "sign forever" (oth olam, Exo 31:17)
- NT continuation: sabbatismos remains (Heb 4:9), apostolic practice (Acts 13-18)
- Eschatological presence: Sabbath worship in new earth (Isa 66:23)

### law-26: Sabbath Shadow Passages
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-26-sabbath-shadow-passages/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- Colossians 2:14-17 analyzed: cheirographon (handwriting of ordinances) = ceremonial law, not Decalogue
- dogma (G1378) in Col 2:14 matches Eph 2:15 (ceremonial regulations), never used of Decalogue
- The ceremonial triad "feast days, new moons, sabbath days" (Col 2:16) matches OT ceremonial patterns (1 Chr 23:31, 2 Chr 2:4, 31:3)
- skia (G4639, "shadow") in Col 2:17 designates forward-pointing types; the weekly Sabbath points backward to creation (Gen 2:2-3), not forward to Christ
- The weekly Sabbath fails all 5 shadow/type criteria: (1) not instituted after sin, (2) not pointing to a future event, (3) not fulfilled at the cross, (4) not ceremonial in character, (5) not temporary by design

## Secondary Related Studies (12)

### law-01: God's Moral Law
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-01-gods-moral-law/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- The Decalogue has 7 unique markers distinguishing it from all other biblical law codes
- Spoken by God directly, written by God's finger, placed inside the Ark
- Law attributes mirror God's own character (holy, just, good - Rom 7:12)
- The moral law is eternal because it reflects God's eternal nature

### law-02: Law Before Sinai
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-02-law-before-sinai/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- Evidence of moral law awareness before Sinai (Cain/Abel, Sodom, patriarchs)
- Sabbath at creation (Gen 2:2-3) predates Sinai by millennia
- Manna test (Exo 16) assumes prior Sabbath knowledge before Decalogue delivery (Exo 20)

### law-04: Ceremonial Laws
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-04-ceremonial-laws/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- 5 categories of ceremonial law identified: sacrificial, priestly, purity, dietary (typological), festival
- skia/shadow designation applies to ceremonial laws, not moral law
- Ceremonial laws are explicitly fulfilled in Christ; moral law is not

### law-08: Abolished at the Cross
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-08-abolished-at-cross/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- 7 "abolition" passages analyzed (Eph 2:15, Col 2:14, Rom 7:6, Gal 3:24-25, 2 Cor 3:7-11, Heb 7:12, Heb 8:13)
- None of these passages names the Decalogue as what was abolished
- Each passage, when examined in context, refers to ceremonial/typological elements or the old covenant administration

### law-09: Old Covenant / New Covenant
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-09-old-covenant-new-covenant/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- The new covenant writes the SAME law on hearts (Jer 31:33 / Heb 8:10)
- What changes between covenants is the arrangement/administration, not the moral content
- "MY law" (possessive pronoun) in Jer 31:33 identifies the law as God's own, not merely Israel's

### law-10: New Covenant and Law
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-10-new-covenant-and-law/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- "MY law" possessive pronouns throughout Jeremiah/Hebrews identify the moral law as God's own
- Faith establishes the law (Rom 3:31), not abolishes it
- The new covenant makes obedience internal rather than eliminating the standard

### law-15: Acts 15 - Jerusalem Council
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-15-acts-15-jerusalem-council/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- Acts 15:21 assumes ongoing Sabbath instruction: "For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day"
- The Council addressed circumcision and ceremonial requirements, not the Decalogue
- The four prohibitions given (Acts 15:29) are a minimum starting point, not an exhaustive moral code

### law-16: Paul and Law in Romans
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-16-paul-and-law-in-romans/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- Paul affirms the moral law as "holy, and just, and good" (Rom 7:12) and "spiritual" (Rom 7:14)
- "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law" (Rom 3:31)
- Paul's positive statements about the law consistently refer to the Decalogue/moral law

### isaiah-66: New Moon and Sabbath
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/isaiah-66-new-moon-sabbath/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- Isaiah 66:23 refers to the weekly Sabbath (not annual), confirmed by Hebrew idiom analysis
- middey shabbat beshabbatto = distributive "every Sabbath" (weekly recurring)
- Context is the new heavens and new earth, placing Sabbath worship in the eternal state
- "All flesh" shall worship - universal scope, not limited to Israel

### sabbath-still-in-effect (older study)
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/sabbath-still-in-effect/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- 8-premise argument chain for Sabbath continuity
- Premises include: creation origin, Decalogue inclusion, Jesus's observance, apostolic practice, Hebrews 4:9 sabbatismos, prophetic continuity (Isa 66:23), no biblical command to change the day

### sabbath-shadow-or-memorial
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/sabbath-shadow-or-memorial/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- zakar (H2142, "remember") vs skia (G4639, "shadow") - Sabbath is memorial, not shadow
- The Sabbath fails all 5 shadow criteria
- The 4th commandment uses zakar ("remember"), pointing backward to creation, not forward to fulfillment

### mark-of-beast-vs-seal-of-god
**File:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/mark-of-beast-vs-seal-of-god/CONCLUSION.md`
**Key Findings:**
- God's seal connected to commandment-keeping (Rev 7:2-3; 14:1,12)
- The Sabbath functions as the "sign" (oth, H226) of God's authority (Exo 31:13,17; Eze 20:12,20)
- The seal/sign identifies God's people as belonging to Him through sanctification
