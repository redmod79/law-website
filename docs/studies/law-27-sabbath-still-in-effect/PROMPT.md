# Bible Study: Is the Seventh-Day Sabbath Still Binding Today?

## Question
Is the seventh-day Sabbath still binding today? This is the capstone Sabbath study. Investigate apostolic practice: Paul in the synagogue on the sabbath (Acts 13:14,42,44), Philippi prayer meeting (Acts 16:13), Thessalonica three sabbaths (Acts 17:2), Corinth every sabbath 18 months (Acts 18:4,11). Jesus's prophecy about Sabbath continuing after the cross: "Pray ye that your flight be not on the sabbath day" (Mat 24:20 -- referring to 70 AD). Luke 23:56 ("rested the sabbath day according to the commandment" -- after crucifixion). Isaiah 66:22-23 ("from one sabbath to another" in the new earth). Hebrews 4:9 (sabbatismos). Compile all evidence from studies 13, 24, 25, 26.

## Methodology
Read and apply the methodology in `D:/bible/bible-studies/law-series-methodology.md`. This study is part of the Law of God series and must follow the investigative methodology, evidence classification system (E/N/I with four inference subtypes), classification decision trees, and master evidence file update protocol specified therein.

**Key findings from prior study conclusions relevant to this study:**

1. **law-13 (Jesus and Sabbath):** Every Sabbath controversy operates within the exesti ("is it lawful?") framework -- debating WHAT is lawful, not WHETHER the Sabbath has binding law. Jesus's settled custom (eiothos, Perfect tense) was Sabbath worship. Paul shares the identical eiothos construction (Acts 17:2). Post-crucifixion: disciples rest "according to the commandment" (Luk 23:56); Jesus instructs prayer about Sabbath flight for AD 70 (Mat 24:20). Sabbatismos (G4520) in Heb 4:9 = "Sabbath-keeping" (not generic rest), with apoleipetai (Present Passive) = "is currently remaining." 11 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished, 6 Continues N-items.

2. **law-24 (Weekly vs ceremonial sabbaths):** Lev 23:37-38 explicitly separates "the sabbaths of the LORD" from the annual feasts using millibad ("beside/apart from"). Weekly Sabbath never called moed or chag. Num 28-29 places Sabbath in own category. Isa 66:22-23 Sabbath continues in new earth. 5 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished.

3. **law-25 (Sabbath moral or ceremonial):** Seven criteria tested systematically. The weekly Sabbath aligns with every moral-law marker (creation origin, Decalogue membership with all 7 markers, direct divine delivery, millibad separation, memorial function zakar, sabbatismos remaining, universal scope) and none of the ceremonial markers. Col 2:16, Rom 14:5, Gal 4:10 all cite passages where the referent is unspecified. Accountability principle: knowledge of moral obligation increases accountability. 17 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished.

4. **law-26 (Sabbath shadow passages):** Col 2:14 uses cheirographon (hand-written) + dogmasin (ordinances); Decalogue = God-written. Col 2:16 triad matches OT ceremonial triad (8 passages). Skia in all 3 NT uses = ceremonial, never Decalogue. Rom 14:5 does not name Sabbath (sabbaton absent); genre = "doubtful disputations." Gal 4:10 does not name Sabbath; context = circumcision. 9 Continues E-items, 0 Abolished.

5. **law-01 through law-12 (cumulative argument chain):** The moral law (Decalogue) is permanent (law-01); ceremonial laws were temporary shadows (law-04); the cross abolished ceremonial law, not moral law (law-08); the new covenant writes the SAME law on hearts (law-09, law-11); faith establishes the law (law-10); the Sabbath is moral law (law-25). Therefore, if the moral law remains and the Sabbath is moral law, the Sabbath remains.

6. **isaiah-66-new-moon-sabbath:** Isaiah 66:23 refers to the weekly seventh-day sabbath (not annual), paired with the monthly new moon. Hebrew structure: "from sabbath to its sabbath" = every week. Both continue in the new earth.

### Focus Areas
(Derived from tool discoveries -- topics and verses found by Nave's, Strong's, semantic searches, and existing study data)

1. **Compile and synthesize evidence from studies 13, 24, 25, 26:** This capstone study must bring together all Sabbath evidence classified in prior studies. Organize by category: (a) creation origin evidence, (b) Decalogue membership evidence, (c) Jesus's teaching and practice evidence, (d) post-crucifixion evidence, (e) apostolic practice evidence, (f) sabbatismos evidence, (g) prophetic continuity evidence (Isa 56, 58, 66), (h) objection passage analysis (Col 2:16, Rom 14:5, Gal 4:10), (i) end-time commandment-keeping evidence.

2. **Apostolic Sabbath practice in Acts -- the cumulative data:** Paul in the synagogue on the sabbath: Acts 13:14,42,44 (Antioch of Pisidia -- Gentiles request next sabbath); Acts 16:13 (Philippi -- no synagogue, Paul seeks sabbath worship by the river); Acts 17:2 (Thessalonica -- kata to eiothos, three sabbaths); Acts 18:4,11 (Corinth -- every sabbath for 18 months, persuading Jews AND Greeks). Acts 15:21 ("Moses read every sabbath"). How many sabbaths are documented in Acts? Does the pattern demonstrate Sabbath as normative for both Jewish and Gentile believers?

3. **The eiothos (G1486) connection -- Jesus to Paul:** Luke uses the identical Greek construction kata to eiothos (Perfect Active Participle) for both Jesus (Luk 4:16) and Paul (Acts 17:2). Same author, same construction, same form. What does this continuity demonstrate about the Sabbath's status after the cross?

4. **Matthew 24:20 -- Jesus's prophecy about Sabbath after the cross:** Jesus tells His disciples to pray that their flight not be on the sabbath day -- in a prophecy about the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, approximately 40 years after the crucifixion. Why would Jesus instruct prayer about the Sabbath if it was going to be abolished at the cross? Context: Mat 24:1-3 (temple destruction), Mat 24:15-21 (abomination of desolation, flight from Judea).

5. **Luke 23:56 -- "rested the sabbath day according to the commandment":** After the crucifixion, the women rested "according to the commandment" (kata ten entolen). Luke writes this description AFTER the cross without any qualification that the commandment had changed. Luke also authored Acts, where he records ongoing Sabbath practice. What does "according to the commandment" mean in a post-crucifixion context?

6. **Hebrews 4:9 -- sabbatismos remains:** The author switches from katapausis (G2663, "rest," 8 times in Heb 3-4) to sabbatismos (G4520, "Sabbath-keeping," 1 time in v.9). The -ismos suffix denotes practice/observance. Apoleipetai (G620, Present Passive Indicative) = "is currently remaining." Heb 4:4 quotes Gen 2:2, grounding the argument in the creation Sabbath. This is post-cross writing affirming that a "Sabbath-keeping remains for the people of God." Examine the logic flow: God rested on the seventh day (v.4) -> Joshua did not give ultimate rest (v.8) -> therefore a sabbatismos remains (v.9) -> we should labor to enter that rest (v.10-11).

7. **Isaiah 66:22-23 -- Sabbath in the new earth:** "From one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD." If the Sabbath was abolished at the cross, why does Isaiah prophesy its continuation in the new heavens and new earth? The Hebrew idiom "from sabbath to its sabbath" = every week. "All flesh" = universal. Connect with the creation-to-new-creation arc: established at creation (Gen 2:2-3) -> codified in Decalogue (Exo 20:8-11) -> practiced pre-Sinai (Exo 16) -> kept by Jesus and apostles -> prophesied in the new earth (Isa 66:23).

8. **Isaiah 56:1-8 -- Sabbath universal scope:** Foreigners ("sons of the stranger") who keep the Sabbath receive access to God's holy mountain. The Sabbath is paired with general moral conduct ("keepeth his hand from doing any evil"). God promises to "gather others" beyond Israel. This undermines the argument that the Sabbath was only for Israel.

9. **The Sabbath as perpetual sign and covenant:** Exo 31:13,16-17 ("a sign...throughout your generations...a perpetual covenant [berit olam]...a sign...for ever"). Eze 20:12,20 ("a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them"). How does the "perpetual covenant" and "sign for ever" language bear on the question of continuing validity?

10. **End-time commandment-keeping:** Rev 14:12 ("here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus"); Rev 12:17 ("keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ"); Rev 22:14 ("Blessed are they that do his commandments"). The Sabbath is the Fourth Commandment. If end-time saints are characterized by commandment-keeping, and the Sabbath is one of the commandments, what does this imply?

11. **The cumulative argument chain from studies 1-26:** Trace the logical chain: (a) The moral law (Decalogue) is permanent, universal, reflects God's character (law-01). (b) The ceremonial system was temporary, pointed to Christ (law-04). (c) The cross abolished ceremonial law, NOT the moral law (law-08). (d) The new covenant writes the SAME law on hearts (law-09, law-11). (e) Faith establishes the moral law (law-10). (f) The Sabbath is moral law by every biblical criterion (law-25). (g) The supposed abolition passages (Col 2:16, Rom 14:5, Gal 4:10) do not name the weekly Sabbath (law-26). (h) Therefore, if the moral law remains and the Sabbath is moral law, the Sabbath remains.

12. **Both sides -- strongest arguments:** Present the strongest Abolished-position arguments (Sabbath was a shadow fulfilled in Christ; Col 2:16 includes weekly Sabbath; Rom 14:5 makes all days optional; Gal 4:10 includes Sabbath; the church transitioned to Sunday; Sabbath was only for Israel) and the strongest Continues-position arguments (creation origin; Decalogue membership; apostolic practice; sabbatismos remains; Jesus's post-cross prophecy; Isaiah new-earth prophecy; no NT passage names the weekly Sabbath as abolished). Evaluate each using the SIS methodology and evidence hierarchy.

13. **The "no command for Sunday" argument:** Examine whether any biblical command exists to transfer Sabbath observance to the first day of the week. What do the first-day-of-the-week passages say (Acts 20:7; 1 Cor 16:2; Rev 1:10)? Do they establish Sunday sacredness, or are they merely narrative or logistical references?
