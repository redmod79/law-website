## [G4521](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4521/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- sabbaton (Greek "Sabbath")
**Original:** sabbaton
**Transliteration:** sab'-bat-on
**Part of Speech:** Neuter noun
**Definition:** Of Hebrew origin (H7676); the Sabbath (i.e., Shabbath), or day of weekly rest.
**Occurrences:** 68 in NT

### Key Verses
- Mat 12:1, 2, 8, 12; 24:20; 28:1
- Mrk 1:21; 2:23, 27; 3:2, 4; 6:2; 15:42; 16:1, 2, 9
- Luk 4:16, 31; 6:5, 7, 9; 13:14, 16; 14:1, 3, 5; 18:12; 23:56; 24:1
- Jhn 5:9, 16, 18; 7:22; 9:16; 19:31; 20:1, 19
- Act 1:12; 13:14, 27, 44; 15:21; 16:13; 17:2; 18:4; 20:7
- 1Co 16:2
- Col 2:16

### Significance for This Study
sabbaton is the central NT term for the Sabbath. It appears in every Acts passage documenting apostolic Sabbath practice. Used in Col 2:16 in the ceremonial triad (feast/new moon/sabbath).

## [G4520](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4520/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- sabbatismos (Sabbath-keeping)
**Original:** sabbatismos
**Transliteration:** sab-bat-is-mos'
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Definition:** A "sabbatism," i.e., the practice of Sabbath rest/observance.
**Occurrences:** 1 (hapax legomenon)

### Key Verse
- Heb 4:9 -- "There remaineth therefore a sabbatismos to the people of God."

### Significance for This Study
This is the single most important word in this study. The author of Hebrews uses katapausis (G2663, "rest") 8 times in Heb 3-4, then SWITCHES to sabbatismos in v.9 only. The -ismos suffix in Greek denotes practice/observance (compare baptismos = practice of baptizing). This deliberate word change from generic "rest" to specific "Sabbath-keeping" is significant. Combined with the present passive verb apoleipetai (G620, "is currently remaining"), the verse states that a practice of Sabbath-keeping is currently remaining for the people of God.

---

## [G1486](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1486/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- etho/eiothos (custom/habit)
**Original:** etho
**Transliteration:** eth'-o
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Definition:** A primary verb; to be used (by habit or conventionality); neuter.
**Occurrences:** 4

### Key Verses
- Mat 27:15 (Pilate's custom to release a prisoner)
- Mrk 10:1 (as Jesus was wont/accustomed)
- Luk 4:16 -- "as his custom was [kata to eiothos], he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day"
- Act 17:2 -- "Paul, as his manner was [kata to eiothos], went in unto them"

### Significance for This Study
Luke uses the IDENTICAL construction kata to eiothos (Perfect Active Participle) for both Jesus (Luk 4:16) and Paul (Acts 17:2). Same author, same grammatical form. The Perfect tense indicates a settled, completed habit with ongoing results. This connects Paul's Sabbath practice directly to Jesus's pattern.

## [H7676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7676/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- shabbath (Hebrew "sabbath")
**Original:** shabbath
**Transliteration:** shab-bawth'
**Part of Speech:** Masculine/Feminine noun
**Definition:** Intensive from [H7673](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7673/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (shabath); intermission, i.e., specifically the Sabbath.
**Occurrences:** 108

### Key Verses
- Exo 16:23-29; 20:8-11; 31:13-17; 35:2
- Lev 16:31; 19:3, 30; 23:3, 11, 15, 32, 38; 24:8; 25:2-8; 26:2, 34, 35
- Deu 5:12-15
- Isa 1:13; 56:2, 4, 6; 58:13; 66:23
- Jer 17:21-27
- Eze 20:12, 13, 16, 20, 21, 24; 22:8; 44:24; 46:1

### Significance for This Study
Core OT Sabbath term. Distinguished from shabbathown (H7677) in Lev 23 -- the weekly Sabbath uses shabbath shabbathown (double form) while most feast rest days use shabbathown alone. In Lev 23:38, the "sabbaths of the LORD" (shabbetot YHWH) are explicitly separated from the feasts by millibad.

---

## [H7677](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7677/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- shabbathown (sabbatism/rest)
**Original:** shabbathown
**Transliteration:** shab-baw-thone'
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Definition:** From [H7676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7676/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; a sabbatism or special holiday; rest, sabbath.
**Occurrences:** 11

### Key Verses
- Exo 16:23; 31:15; 35:2
- Lev 16:31; 23:3, 24, 32, 39; 25:4, 5

### Significance for This Study
Used for both the weekly Sabbath (Lev 23:3, shabbath shabbathown) and ceremonial rest days (Lev 23:24, 39, shabbathown alone). The vocabulary distribution in Lev 23 shows a pattern: days with the double form (shabbath shabbathown) have the "all work" prohibition; days with shabbathown alone have the "servile work" prohibition.

---

## [G2663](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2663/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- katapausis (rest)
**Original:** katapausis
**Transliteration:** kat-ap'-ow-sis
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** From [G2664](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2664/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; reposing down, i.e., (by Hebraism) abode; rest.
**Occurrences:** 9

### Key Verses
- Psa 94:11; 95:11
- Act 7:49
- Heb 3:11, 18; 4:1, 3, 5, 10

### Significance for This Study
Used 8 times in Heb 3-4 for "rest" in the general sense. The author deliberately switches to sabbatismos (G4520) in Heb 4:9, indicating a purposeful distinction. katapausis = generic rest; sabbatismos = specific Sabbath-keeping practice.

---

## [G620](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g620/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- apoleipo (to leave remaining)
**Original:** apoleipo
**Transliteration:** ap-ol-ipe'-o
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Definition:** From [G575](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g575/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} and [G3007](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3007/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; to leave behind (passively, remain).
**Occurrences:** 6

### Key Verses
- 2Ti 4:13, 20 (left behind at Troas/Miletus)
- Tit 1:5 (left in Crete)
- Heb 4:6, 9 (remaineth)
- Heb 10:26 (remaineth no more sacrifice)
- Jude 1:6 (left their own habitation)

### Significance for This Study
In Heb 4:9, apoleipetai is **Present Passive Indicative** -- "is currently being left remaining." The present tense indicates an ongoing state. The passive voice indicates something done TO the sabbatismos (it is left remaining by God). Combined with sabbatismos: "A Sabbath-keeping is currently remaining for the people of God."

---

## [G4639](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4639/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- skia (shadow)
**Original:** skia
**Transliteration:** skee'-ah
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** Apparently a primary word; "shade" or a shadow (literally or figuratively).
**Occurrences:** 7

### Key Verses
- Isa 9:1; Eze 17:23 (literal shadow/shade)
- Mat 4:16; Luk 1:79 (shadow of death -- metaphorical)
- Mrk 4:32; Act 5:15 (literal shadow)
- Col 2:17 -- "which are a shadow of things to come"
- Heb 8:5 -- "who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things"
- Heb 10:1 -- "the law having a shadow of good things to come"

### Significance for This Study
skia in all three NT theological uses (Col 2:17; Heb 8:5; Heb 10:1) is applied to the ceremonial system -- never to the Decalogue. The weekly Sabbath uses zakar ("remember," pointing backward to creation), not skia (pointing forward to Christ). These are opposite temporal directions.

---

## [H2142](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2142/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- zakar (remember)
**Original:** zakar
**Transliteration:** zaw-kar'
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Definition:** A primitive root; properly, to mark (so as to be recognized), i.e., to remember; by implication, to mention; also to be male.
**Occurrences:** 233

### Key Verses
- Exo 20:8 -- "**Remember** [zakar, Infinitive Absolute] the sabbath day, to keep it holy"
- Exo 13:3 -- "Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt"
- Deu 5:15 -- "Remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt"
- Deu 8:2 -- "thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee"

### Significance for This Study
zakar is the quintessential MEMORIAL verb in the OT. It always looks BACKWARD to a completed past event. The Fourth Commandment opens with zakar in the Infinitive Absolute (the most emphatic Hebrew verb form), pointing backward to creation. A memorial commemorates a past event; a shadow (skia) anticipates a future event. The Sabbath is a zakar institution (memorial), not a skia institution (shadow).

## [G1785](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1785/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- entole (commandment)
**Original:** entole
**Transliteration:** en-tol-ay'
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** From [G1781](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1781/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; injunction, i.e., an authoritative prescription.
**Occurrences:** 71

### Key Verses
- Luk 23:56 -- "rested the sabbath day according to the commandment [kata ten entolen]"
- Rev 14:12 -- "they that keep the commandments [entolas] of God, and the faith of Jesus"
- Rev 12:17 -- "which keep the commandments [entolas] of God, and have the testimony of Jesus"
- Rev 22:14 -- "Blessed are they that do his commandments [entolas]"
- 1Co 7:19 -- "the keeping of the commandments [entolon] of God"
- Rom 7:8-12 -- "the commandment [entole]...holy, and just, and good"
- Jhn 14:15 -- "If ye love me, keep my commandments [entolas]"

### Significance for This Study
entole (unqualified, with "of God") consistently refers to the moral law / Decalogue in the NT. In Luk 23:56, Luke calls the Sabbath "the commandment" (entole) AFTER the crucifixion. In Revelation, end-time saints are defined by keeping "the commandments of God" (entolas tou theou). The Sabbath is the Fourth Commandment.

---

## [H5769](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5769/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- olam (perpetual/everlasting)
**Original:** olam
**Transliteration:** o-lawm'
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Definition:** From [H5956](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5956/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; properly concealed, i.e., the vanishing point; generally, time out of mind; practically, eternity; perpetual, everlasting, forever.
**Occurrences:** 439

### Key Verses
- Exo 31:16 -- "a perpetual covenant [berit olam]"
- Exo 31:17 -- "a sign...for ever [le-olam]"
- Psa 111:7-8 -- "all his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever [le-ad le-olam]"
- Psa 119:89 -- "For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven"
- Psa 119:152 -- "Concerning thy testimonies...thou hast founded them for ever [le-olam]"

### Significance for This Study
The Sabbath is designated as berit olam ("perpetual covenant") in Exo 31:16 and as "a sign...for ever" (le-olam) in Exo 31:17. The creation rationale ties the olam designation to the fixed creation event, not to a temporary ceremonial arrangement.

## [G4864](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4864/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- synagoge (synagogue)
**Original:** synagoge
**Transliteration:** soon-ag-o-gay'
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** From [G4863](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4863/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; an assemblage of persons; specifically a Jewish "synagogue."
**Occurrences:** 57

### Key Verses
- Luk 4:16 -- Jesus's custom was synagogue on the Sabbath
- Act 13:5, 14, 42, 43 -- Paul in synagogues on the Sabbath
- Act 14:1; 15:21; 17:1, 10, 17; 18:4, 7, 19, 26; 19:8

### Significance for This Study
The synagogue was the standard venue for Sabbath worship in the apostolic period. Paul's pattern was to enter the synagogue on the Sabbath day wherever he went. Acts 15:21 assumes ongoing Sabbath synagogue attendance as normative.

---

## [H226](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h226/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- oth (sign)
**Original:** oth
**Transliteration:** oth
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** A signal (literally or figuratively), as a flag, beacon, monument, omen, prodigy, evidence; mark, miracle, sign, token.
**Occurrences:** 79

### Key Verses
- Gen 1:14 -- luminaries for "signs" (otot) and seasons
- Gen 9:12, 13, 17 -- rainbow as "sign" of the covenant
- Gen 17:11 -- circumcision as "sign" of the covenant
- Exo 31:13 -- "it is a sign [oth] between me and you throughout your generations"
- Exo 31:17 -- "It is a sign [oth] between me and the children of Israel for ever"
- Eze 20:12 -- "I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign [oth] between me and them"
- Eze 20:20 -- "hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign [oth] between me and you"

### Significance for This Study
The Sabbath is designated as an oth (sign) between God and His people, indicating identity and relationship. The sign function connects to who God is ("that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you," Exo 31:13). The creation rationale (Exo 31:17) grounds the sign in God's identity as Creator.

---

## [H6942](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6942/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- qadash (to sanctify)
**Original:** qadash
**Transliteration:** kaw-dash'
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Definition:** A primitive root; to be (causatively, make, pronounce or observe as) clean (ceremonially or morally); appoint, consecrate, dedicate, hallow, sanctify.
**Occurrences:** 172

### Key Verses
- Gen 2:3 -- "God blessed the seventh day, and **sanctified** [qadash] it"
- Exo 20:8 -- "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it **holy** [qadash]"
- Exo 20:11 -- "the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and **hallowed** [qadash] it"
- Exo 31:13 -- "that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth **sanctify** [qadash] you"
- Eze 20:12 -- "that they might know that I am the LORD that **sanctify** [qadash] them"

### Significance for This Study
God performed three actions on the seventh day at creation: He rested (shabath), blessed (barakh), and sanctified (qadash). qadash means to set apart as holy. This was done at creation, before sin, before Israel, before any ceremonial system. The same verb is used both for what God did to the Sabbath day and what God does to His people.

## [G752](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g752/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} -- archisynagogos (ruler of the synagogue)
**Original:** archisynagogos
**Transliteration:** ar-khee-soon-ag'-o-gos
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Definition:** From [G746](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g746/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} and [G4864](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4864/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; director of the synagogue services.
**Occurrences:** 9

### Key Verses
- Mrk 5:22, 35, 38 (Jairus)
- Luk 8:49; 13:14
- Act 13:15; 18:8, 17

### Significance for This Study
The archisynagogos (synagogue ruler) is the one who invites speakers on the Sabbath (Acts 13:15). In Luk 13:14, the synagogue ruler objects to Jesus healing on the Sabbath -- demonstrating the exesti ("is it lawful?") framework that presupposes the Sabbath's legal force. In Acts 18:8, Crispus the archisynagogos believes, showing Jewish Sabbath leaders coming to faith within the Sabbath-worship setting.
