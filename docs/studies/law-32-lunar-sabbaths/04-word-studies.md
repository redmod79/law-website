# Word Studies

## Question
Does the Bible teach that the weekly Sabbath is governed by the lunar cycle (falling on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th of each lunar month), or does it follow a continuous 7-day cycle independent of the moon?

## Hebrew Word Studies

### shabbath (H7676) -- "Sabbath, intermission"
**Original:** שַׁבָּת
**Transliteration:** shabbath
**Pronunciation:** shab-bawth
**POS:** masculine/feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 108 (BLB) / 109 (Strong's translation data)

**Definition:** Intensive from [H7673](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7673/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (shabath); intermission, i.e. (specifically) the Sabbath: (every) sabbath.

**Translations:**
- "the sabbath" -- 42 occurrences (38.5%)
- "my sabbaths" -- 14 (12.8%)
- "on the sabbath" -- 11 (10.1%)
- "a sabbath" -- 7 (6.4%)
- "sabbath" -- 6 (5.5%)
- "her sabbaths" -- 4 (3.7%)
- Other forms with "sabbath" in every case

**Key Finding:** In 108 OT uses, shabbath is ALWAYS translated with "sabbath" or "rest" terminology. It NEVER carries a lunar meaning, is NEVER conditioned on lunar phases, and is NEVER connected to the moon in any verse.

### shabbathon (H7677) -- "Sabbatism, special holiday"
**Original:** שַׁבָּתוֹן
**Transliteration:** shabbathon
**Pronunciation:** shab-baw-thone
**POS:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 11

**Definition:** From [H7676](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7676/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; a sabbatism or special holiday: rest, sabbath.

**Translations:** "of rest" (7, 63.6%), "a sabbath" (3, 27.3%), "the rest" (1, 9.1%)

**Key Verses:**
- Exo 16:23 -- "the rest of the holy sabbath" (shabbath shabbathon)
- Exo 31:15; 35:2 -- "sabbath of rest" (shabbath shabbathon)
- Lev 23:3 -- weekly Sabbath: "sabbath of rest" (shabbath shabbathon)
- Lev 23:24 -- Feast of Trumpets: "a sabbath" (shabbathon alone)
- Lev 23:32 -- Day of Atonement: "sabbath of rest" (shabbath shabbathon)
- Lev 23:39 -- Tabernacles: "a sabbath... a sabbath" (shabbathon alone, 2x)
- Lev 25:4-5 -- Sabbatical year: "a sabbath... a year of rest"

**Key Finding:** When paired with shabbath (shabbath shabbathon), used for the weekly Sabbath and Day of Atonement = "all work" prohibited. When used alone (shabbathon), used for Trumpets and Tabernacles rest = "servile work" prohibited. Two vocabulary levels. No lunar meaning in any occurrence.

### shabath (H7673) -- "To cease, rest, desist" (verb)
**Original:** שָׁבַת
**Transliteration:** shabath
**Pronunciation:** shaw-bath
**POS:** verb
**Occurrences:** 71

**Definition:** A primitive root; to repose, i.e. desist from exertion; used in many implied relations: (cause to, let, make to) cease, celebrate, cause (make) to fail, keep (sabbath), suffer to be lacking, leave, put away (down), (make to) rest, rid, still, take away.

**Translations:** "to cease" (19, 17.3%), "cease" (5), "ceased" (4), "rest" (3), etc.

**Key Verses:**
- Gen 2:2-3 -- God "rested" (vayyishbot) on the seventh day
- Gen 8:22 -- "shall not cease"
- Exo 16:30 -- "the people rested"
- Exo 31:17 -- God "rested, and was refreshed"
- Lev 23:32 -- "ye shall celebrate your sabbath"

**Key Finding:** The verb behind the noun shabbath. Means "to cease, stop, desist" -- a concept of cessation from activity. No lunar connotation in any of its 71 uses.

### chodesh (H2320) -- "New moon, month"
**Original:** חֹדֶשׁ
**Transliteration:** chodesh
**Pronunciation:** kho-desh
**POS:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 276

**Definition:** From [H2318](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2318/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (chadash, "to be new"); the new moon; by implication, a month: month(-ly), new moon.

**Translations:** "month" (126, 32.2%), "of the month" (53, 13.6%), "months" (29, 7.4%), "the new moon" (4, 1.0%), other "new moon" forms (~15 total)

**Key Finding:** Primarily means "month" (the calendar unit). "New moon" is secondary. When used alongside shabbath, they are ALWAYS distinguished as separate items: 2Ki 4:23; 1Ch 23:31; 2Ch 2:4; 8:13; 31:3; Isa 1:13; 66:23; Eze 46:1,6; Hos 2:11; Amo 8:5. No verse places chodesh in a GOVERNING relationship over shabbath.

### yareach (H3394) -- "Moon" (celestial body)
**Original:** יָרֵחַ
**Transliteration:** yareach
**Pronunciation:** yaw-ray-akh
**POS:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 26

**Definition:** The moon.

**Key Verses:** Gen 37:9; Psa 104:19; Jos 10:12; Isa 13:10; 60:19

**Key Finding:** In 26 OT uses, yareach NEVER appears in a Sabbath context. It NEVER governs, determines, or is connected to the weekly Sabbath. Psa 104:19 says the moon is for moadim (H4150, festival seasons), not shabbatot (sabbaths).

### levanah (H3842) -- "Moon" (poetic: "the white one")
**Original:** לְבָנָה
**Transliteration:** levanah
**Pronunciation:** leb-aw-naw
**POS:** feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 3

**Definition:** Properly, (the) white, i.e. the moon.

**Key Verses:** Song 6:10; Isa 24:23; 30:26

**Key Finding:** Extremely rare poetic word for the moon. NEVER connected to the Sabbath in any way.

### moed (H4150) -- "Appointed time, festival, assembly, congregation"
**Original:** מוֹעֵד
**Transliteration:** moed
**Pronunciation:** mo-ade
**POS:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 223

**Definition:** Properly, an appointment, i.e. a fixed time or season; specifically, a festival; conventionally a year; by implication, an assembly; technically the congregation; by extension, the place of meeting.

**Translations:**
- "of the congregation" -- 146 occurrences (63.8%) = PLACE (tabernacle of the congregation)
- When temporal: "the feasts" (4), "in his appointed season" (3), "season" (2), various feast/festival terms
- NEVER: "sabbath" or "weekly rest"

**Key Verses:**
- Gen 1:14 -- lights "for seasons (moadim)" -- the luminaries govern moadim
- Lev 23:2,4,37,44 -- "the feasts (moadim) of the LORD" = annual festivals
- Psa 104:19 -- moon appointed for moadim
- Eze 44:24; 45:17; 46:9,11 -- feasts (moadim) as category distinct from sabbaths

**Key Finding:** [H4150](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4150/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} (moed) is NEVER used as a synonym for the weekly sabbath (H7676). Of 223 uses, 146 mean "tabernacle of the congregation" (a PLACE). When temporal, it refers to appointed festivals and seasons. Gen 1:14 assigns the luminaries to govern moadim; the weekly sabbath is absent from this assignment. Lev 23:37-38 explicitly separates the moadim from "the sabbaths of the LORD."

### oth (H226) -- "Sign, signal, token"
**Original:** אוֹת
**Transliteration:** oth
**Pronunciation:** oth
**POS:** feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 79

**Definition:** A signal (literally or figuratively), as a flag, beacon, monument, omen, prodigy, evidence: mark, miracle, (en-)sign, token.

**Key Verses:**
- Gen 1:14 -- lights for "signs" (othoth)
- Exo 31:13,17 -- Sabbath IS a sign (oth) between God and Israel
- Eze 20:12,20 -- "my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them"

**Key Finding:** The Sabbath itself IS a sign (oth) -- but Gen 1:14 lists the luminaries as producing signs (othoth), and the Sabbath is NOT among the listed purposes of the luminaries. The Sabbath is a sign of God's sanctifying relationship, not a sign derived from celestial observation.

### bad (H905) -- "Separation, apart, besides"
**Original:** בַּד
**Transliteration:** bad
**Pronunciation:** bad
**POS:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 56

**Definition:** From [H909](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h909/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; properly, separation; by implication, a part of the body, branch of a tree, bar for carrying; especially (with prepositional prefix) as an adverb, apart, only, besides.

**Translations:** "beside" (33, 16.3%), "alone" (32, 15.8%), "only" (30, 14.8%), "apart" (11, 5.4%)

**Key Verse:** Lev 23:38 -- millibad (min + le + bad) = "apart from, besides, separate from." Used FOUR TIMES in one verse to place "the sabbaths of the LORD" in a SEPARATE category from the annual feasts.

### chag (H2282) -- "Festival, pilgrimage feast"
**Original:** חַג
**Transliteration:** chag
**Pronunciation:** khag
**POS:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 62

**Definition:** A festival, or a victim therefor: (solemn) feast (day), sacrifice, solemnity.

**Key Finding:** NEVER used for the weekly Sabbath. Exclusively for annual pilgrimage feasts (Unleavened Bread, Pentecost/Weeks, Tabernacles). The weekly Sabbath is a different institution.

### shabua (H7620) -- "Week, period of seven"
**Original:** שָׁבוּעַ
**Transliteration:** shabua
**Pronunciation:** shaw-boo-ah
**POS:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 20

**Definition:** Properly, passive participle of [H7650](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7650/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"} as a denominative of [H7651](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7651/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; literally, sevened, i.e. a week (specifically, of years): seven, week.

**Key Finding:** Related to sheba (seven). Confirms the seven-day structure of the week. The word itself means "a period of seven" -- a fixed, consistent count, not a variable lunar-determined period.

### kece (H3677) -- "Full moon"
**Original:** כֶּסֶא
**Transliteration:** kece
**Pronunciation:** keh-seh
**POS:** masculine noun
**Occurrences:** 2

**Definition:** Properly, fulness or the full moon, i.e. its festival: (time) appointed.

**Key Verses:** Psa 81:3; Pro 7:20

**Key Finding:** Refers to the full moon festival -- NOT the weekly Sabbath. Psa 81:3 connects kece with the feast trumpet on the "solemn feast day" (chag), not with the weekly sabbath. This is a distinct institution.

### shvi'i (H7637) -- "Seventh" (ordinal)
**Original:** שְׁבִיעִי
**Transliteration:** shvi'i
**Pronunciation:** sheb-ee-ee
**POS:** adjective
**Occurrences:** 98

**Key Verses:** Gen 2:2-3 ("the seventh day"); Exo 20:10 ("the seventh day is the sabbath")

**Key Finding:** The ordinal "seventh" directly connects the Sabbath to the creation week's fixed seven-day pattern.

## Greek Word Studies

### sabbaton (G4521) -- "Sabbath, week"
**Original:** σάββατον
**Transliteration:** sabbaton
**Pronunciation:** sab-bat-on
**POS:** neuter noun
**Occurrences:** 68 (BLB) / 55 in translation data

**Definition:** Of Hebrew origin (H7676); the Sabbath (i.e. Shabbath), or day of weekly repose.

**Translations:** "sabbath" (19, 34.5%), "sabbath day" (13, 23.6%), "sabbath days" (7, 12.7%), "of the week" (4, 7.3%), "week" (3, 5.5%)

**Key Finding:** Fixed weekly term used consistently in all four Gospels and Acts. The crucifixion sequence (Paraskeue -> Sabbaton -> mia ton sabbaton) uses sabbaton as a standardized weekly day-name. In Col 2:16, sabbaton appears alongside heorte (feast) and noumenia (new moon) as a distinct category.

### paraskeue (G3904) -- "Preparation" = Friday
**Original:** παρασκευή
**Transliteration:** paraskeue
**Pronunciation:** par-ask-yoo-ay
**POS:** feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 6

**Definition:** Readiness; preparation.

**Key Verses:** Mat 27:62; Mrk 15:42; Luk 23:54; Jhn 19:14,31,42

**Key Finding:** A FIXED name for the day before the Sabbath (Friday). Modern Greek STILL calls Friday "Paraskeue" -- a living linguistic fossil from the first century. A fixed day-name for the day before the Sabbath proves a predictable, fixed weekly cycle. A floating lunar sabbath could NOT produce a standardized "Preparation Day."

### prosabbaton (G4315) -- "Before-Sabbath"
**Original:** προσάββατον
**Transliteration:** prosabbaton
**Pronunciation:** pros-ab-bat-on
**POS:** neuter noun
**Occurrences:** 1 (hapax legomenon)

**Definition:** From [G4253](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4253/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"} and [G4521](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4521/kjv/tr/0-1/){:target="_blank"}; a fore-sabbath, i.e. the Sabbath-eve: day before [the sabbath].

**Key Verse:** Mrk 15:42 -- Mark defines paraskeue AS prosabbaton: "it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath."

**Key Finding:** A compound word (pro + sabbaton) coined specifically because the day before the Sabbath is PREDICTABLE and FIXED enough to warrant its own term. This is impossible with a floating lunar sabbath.

### etho (G1486) -- "Custom, habit"
**Original:** ἔθω
**Transliteration:** etho
**Pronunciation:** eth-o
**POS:** verb
**Occurrences:** 4

**Definition:** A primary verb; to be used (by habit or conventionality).

**Key Verses:**
- Luk 4:16 -- "as his custom was" (kata to eiothos auto) -- Jesus's settled Sabbath custom
- Act 17:2 -- "as his manner was" (kata to eiothos) -- Paul's settled Sabbath custom

**Key Finding:** The Perfect Active Participle eiothos means a SETTLED, COMPLETED state of habituation. Both Jesus and Paul had the same settled sabbath custom. A settled habit requires regular, predictable recurrence. If the sabbath shifted monthly due to lunar phases, it could NOT be described as a settled habit -- it would require monthly recalculation.

### noumenia (G3561) -- "New moon"
**Original:** νουμηνία
**Transliteration:** noumenia
**Pronunciation:** noo-may-nee-ah
**POS:** feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 1

**Definition:** New moon (compound of neos + mene).

**Key Verse:** Col 2:16 -- "in respect of an holyday (heorte), or of the new moon (noumenia), or of the sabbath days (sabbaton)"

**Key Finding:** The ONLY NT use of noumenia is in Col 2:16, where it is distinguished from sabbaton in the SAME VERSE. The Colossians triad (feast/new moon/sabbath) matches the OT ceremonial triad (2Ch 31:3; Eze 45:17; Hos 2:11). If sabbath were determined by the moon, listing noumenia and sabbaton separately would be redundant.

**No Hebrew or Greek word study provides ANY support for a lunar-governed weekly Sabbath. Every word study confirms the Sabbath as a fixed weekly institution independent of the moon.**

## Hebrew Parsing of Key Verses

Full Hebrew parsing data (word-by-word morphological analysis) is available in `raw-data/hebrew-parsing.md` for these five key verses:

### Genesis 1:14 -- Four Purposes of the Luminaries
**Hebrew:** וְהָי֤וּ לְאֹתֹת֙ וּלְמֹ֣ועֲדִ֔ים וּלְיָמִ֖ים וְשָׁנִֽים
The four purposes introduced by the prepositional lamed (ל):
- לְאֹתֹת (le-othoth) = for **signs** (אות, H226)
- וּלְמֹ֣ועֲדִ֔ים (u-le-mo'adim) = and for **appointed times** (מועד, H4150)
- וּלְיָמִ֖ים (u-le-yamim) = and for **days** (יום, H3117)
- וְשָׁנִֽים (ve-shanim) = and **years** (שׁנה)

**Key:** The word used is מועד (moed), NOT שׁבת (shabbat). The weekly sabbath is absent from the luminaries' purpose list.

### Genesis 2:2-3 -- God's Three Acts on the Seventh Day
The verb וַיִּשְׁבֹּת (vayyishbot) = שׁבת (shabat, H7673) in Qal Wayyiqtol 3ms = "and he ceased." This is the verb root behind the noun שַׁבָּת (shabbat). Three divine acts: finished (כלה Piel), ceased (שׁבת Qal), blessed (ברך Piel), sanctified (קדשׁ Piel). The institution is defined by cessation from activity, not by lunar observation. "The seventh day" uses the ordinal שְׁבִיעִי (shevi'i, H7637) -- connecting the sabbath to the number seven, not to a lunar date.

### Leviticus 23:38 -- The millibad Construction
**Hebrew:** מִלְּבַד (millibad) = compound preposition from מן (min, "from") + ל (le, "to") + בד (bad, [H905](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h905/kjv/wlc/0-1/){:target="_blank"}, "part, separation"). Meaning: "apart from, besides, separate from." Appears **FOUR TIMES** in this one verse, separating the annual feasts from: (1) the sabbaths of YHWH, (2) your gifts, (3) all your vows, (4) all your freewill offerings. The noun שַׁבְּתֹ֣ת (shabbetot) is the feminine plural construct of שׁבת = "sabbaths of [YHWH]." This is the clearest grammatical proof that annual feasts and weekly sabbaths are separate categories.

### Psalm 104:19 -- Moon for Moadim
**Hebrew:** עָשָׂ֣ה יָ֭רֵחַ לְמֹועֲדִ֑ים = "He made the moon (yareach, H3394) for appointed times (moadim, H4150)." The lamed preposition (ל) indicates purpose. The word used is מועד (moed), NOT שׁבת (shabbat). If the sabbath were governed by the moon, we would expect שׁבתות (shabbatot) to appear here. Its absence is significant.

### Ezekiel 46:1 -- Three Categories with Identical Syntax
Three time categories with parallel grammatical construction:
- שֵׁ֖שֶׁת יְמֵ֣י הַֽמַּעֲשֶׂ֑ה (sheshet yemei hamma'aseh) = "six working days" -- gate SHUT
- וּבְיֹ֤ום הַשַּׁבָּת֙ (u-beyom hashabbat) = "on the day of the sabbath" -- gate OPENED
- וּבְיֹ֥ום הַחֹ֖דֶשׁ (u-beyom hachodesh) = "on the day of the new moon" -- gate OPENED

The sabbath and new moon are introduced with identical syntax (ו + ב + יום + ה + noun), making them coordinate but distinct. Two different occasions receiving the same treatment, listed as separate items. If the sabbath were determined by the new moon, there would be no need to list them separately.
