## Question
Does the Bible teach that the weekly Sabbath is governed by the lunar cycle (falling on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th of each lunar month), or does it follow a continuous 7-day cycle independent of the moon?

**Key observation:** Nave's SABBATH entry contains NO reference to the moon or lunar phases. Every verse listed describes a fixed weekly institution.

### NEW MOON
- **Feast of:** NUM 10:10; 28:11-15; 1CH 23:31; 2CH 31:3
- **Traffic at time of, suspended:** AMO 8:5

**Key observation:** The NEW MOON topic is entirely separate from the SABBATH topic in Nave's dictionary. They are cross-referenced only in passages that LIST them as separate observances (1Ch 23:31; 2Ch 31:3; Amo 8:5).

### MOON
- **Created by God:** GEN 1:16; PSA 8:3; 136:7-9
- **Seasons of (months):** PSA 104:19
- **Worship of, forbidden:** DEU 4:19; 17:3
- **Feast of the NEW MOON:** NUM 10:10; 28:11-15; 1CH 23:31; 2CH 31:3; EZR 3:5

**Key observation:** The MOON topic mentions "seasons" (moadim = appointed times/festivals) but NEVER mentions governing the weekly Sabbath.

### MANNA
- **General scriptures:** EXO 16:4-35; NUM 11:6-10; DEU 8:3,16; JOS 5:12; NEH 9:20; PSA 78:24; JHN 6:31,49,58
- **Preserved in the ark:** EXO 16:33; HEB 9:4

**Key observation:** The manna cycle (EXO 16) demonstrates a continuous 6+1 cycle for 40 years. No monthly disruption or lunar reset is recorded.

### SEASONS
- **General scriptures:** GEN 1:14; 8:22; PSA 104:19; JER 33:20; DAN 2:21; MAT 21:41; 24:32; MRK 12:2; ACT 1:7; 1TH 5:1

**Key observation:** GEN 1:14 assigns the luminaries to govern seasons (moadim), but the weekly Sabbath is not in this list.

### REST
- **Divine institutions for:** See SABBATH
- **Days of:** EXO 23:12; 34:21
- **Annual feasts, added rest days:** LEV 23:7,8,21,25,28,30,31,35,36; NUM 28:18,25,26; 29:1,7,12,35
- **Spiritual:** HEB 4:1-11

**Key observation:** REST distinguishes between the weekly Sabbath rest and the annual feast rest days.

### MONTH
- Ancient use of: GEN 7:11; 8:4
- Twelve months reckoned to a year: 1CH 27:1-15
- Jewish calendar began with Abib: EXO 12:2; 13:4; DEU 16:1

### FEASTS (ANNUAL)
- Designated as SOLEMN FEASTS: NUM 15:3; 2CH 8:13; LAM 2:6; EZK 46:9

- All males required to attend: EXO 23:17; 34:23; DEU 16:16

**Key observation:** Annual feasts are tied to specific lunar dates (14th of Nisan, 15th of Tishri, etc.). The weekly Sabbath has NO such date assignment.

### DAILY OFFERING
- Sacrificial: EXO 29:38-42; NUM 28:3-8; EZK 46:13-15

**Key observation:** Numbers 28 arranges offerings in ascending temporal categories: daily (28:1-8) > weekly sabbath (28:9-10) > monthly new moon (28:11-15) > annual feasts (28:16-29:38). The sabbath has its own weekly category.

### SABBATIC YEAR

### JUBILEE

### Consistent Three-Category Pattern
Multiple Nave's topics confirm that sabbaths, new moons, and feasts are consistently listed as THREE SEPARATE categories throughout the OT and NT:
- SABBATH topic: lists sabbath verses
- NEW MOON topic: lists new moon verses
- FEASTS topic: lists festival verses
- The three appear together as separate items in: 1Ch 23:31; 2Ch 2:4; 8:13; 31:3; Ezr 3:5; Eze 45:17; Hos 2:11; Col 2:16
