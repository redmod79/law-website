### LEV 23:3 -- Concepts: FULFILLMENT (H6213), CALLING (H4744), TEMPLE (H6944), HOLY (H6944)
Same Chapter (Leviticus 23): 17 verses share these concepts
Key conceptual connections within Lev 23:
- v.21 [CALLING, FULFILLMENT, HOLY] -- Pentecost: holy convocation, no servile work
- v.35 [CALLING, FULFILLMENT, HOLY] -- Tabernacles: holy convocation, no servile work
- v.36 [CALLING, FULFILLMENT, HOLY] -- Solemn assembly, no servile work
- v.7 [CALLING, FULFILLMENT, HOLY] -- Unleavened Bread: holy convocation, no servile work
- v.8 [CALLING, FULFILLMENT, HOLY] -- Seventh day: holy convocation, no servile work
- v.2 [CALLING, HOLY] -- "feasts of the LORD, holy convocations"
- v.4 [CALLING, HOLY] -- "feasts of the LORD, holy convocations, in their seasons"
- v.37 [CALLING, HOLY] -- Summary: "feasts of the LORD, holy convocations"

Note: While v.3 shares "holy convocation" vocabulary with the feast days, the distinction lies in: (1) no calendar date for the weekly sabbath, (2) different work prohibition level (kol-melakhah vs melekhet abodah), (3) v.4 restarts the feast formula, and (4) v.38 millibad explicitly separates them.

### NUM 28:9 -- Concepts: LAMB (H3532), SACRIFICE (H4503)
