## lunar-sabbath-rebuttal (Score: 0.744)
**Question:** Does the Bible support the "Lunar Sabbath" theory?
**Answer:** No. The Bible does not support the lunar sabbath theory. Every line of biblical evidence confirms the weekly Sabbath operates on a continuous 7-day cycle independent of lunar phases. The theory fails on six counts: (1) contradicts the 40-year manna cycle, (2) ignores the 7-day week established at creation three days before the moon, (3) misreads Leviticus 23 which explicitly separates weekly sabbath from festivals using millibad, (4) conflates moed with shabbat, (5) cannot account for NT fixed weekly terminology, (6) has zero biblical support.

## law-24-weekly-sabbath-vs-ceremonial-sabbaths (Score: 0.553)
**Question:** Does the Bible itself distinguish the weekly Sabbath from the annual ceremonial sabbaths?
**Answer:** Yes. Through multiple converging lines: structural separation in Lev 23, explicit vocabulary separation via millibad (Lev 23:37-38), two distinct work prohibition levels (kol-melakhah vs melekhet abodah), distinct offering category in Numbers 28-29. The weekly Sabbath is grounded in creation, never called moed or chag.
**Key findings for this study:**
- E4: Lev 23:38 millibad separation (Continues)
- E8: Two levels of work prohibition (Continues)
- E9: Numbers 28-29 separate category (Continues)
- N2: millibad separation is explicit textual distinction (Continues)
- N6: Moadim of Gen 1:14 tied to luminaries; weekly sabbath absent

## law-25-sabbath-moral-or-ceremonial (Score: 0.487)
**Question:** Is the Sabbath moral or ceremonial?
**Answer:** Seven criteria all point to the Sabbath as moral law: creation origin, Decalogue membership, delivery mode, Lev 23 separation, memorial (zakar) function, sabbatismos (Heb 4:9), universal scope.

## law-27-sabbath-still-in-effect (Score: 0.498)
**Question:** Is the seventh-day Sabbath still binding?
**Answer:** No verse in the NT explicitly abolishes the weekly Sabbath or transfers its sanctity. Sabbath grounded in creation, confirmed by Jesus, treated as operative after crucifixion, anticipated for post-cross era, declared remaining via sabbatismos, prophesied for new earth.

## seventh-day-identity (Score: 0.555)
**Question:** Can we identify the seventh day today?
**Answer:** Yes. The unbroken weekly cycle from creation to present is confirmed by: crucifixion sequence, manna test (~2,080 consecutive weeks), Gregorian calendar reform (changed dates not days), Jewish preservation worldwide, 108+ languages naming Saturday as "Sabbath."

## isaiah-66-new-moon-sabbath (Score: 0.563)
**Question:** Isaiah 66:23 -- new moon and sabbath relationship
**Answer:** New moon (chodesh) and sabbath (shabbat) are distinct but complementary: monthly and weekly worship cycles. The parallel Hebrew construction shows two independent cycles. If sabbath were determined by moon, listing separately would be redundant.

## sabbath-shadow-or-memorial (Score: 0.489)
**Question:** Is Sabbath a shadow or memorial?
**Answer:** Sabbath uses zakar (memorial, backward to creation), not skia (shadow, forward to fulfillment). It is a creation memorial, not a typological shadow.
